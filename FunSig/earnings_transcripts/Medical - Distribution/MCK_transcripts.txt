Operator: Welcome to McKesson's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeni Dominguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jeni Dominguez: Good afternoon. And welcome everyone to McKesson's fourth quarter fiscal 2025 earnings call. Today I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we'll move into a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, such as forecasts about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com and to the Risk Factors Section of our most recent Annual and periodic SEC filings for more information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Information about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results, can be found in today's earnings release and presentation slides. Presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and guidance assumptions. With that, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian Tyler : Thank you, Jeni. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. Today, we reported fiscal fourth quarter results, marking a strong finish to fiscal 2025. Thanks to the collective efforts of our 45,000 employees, Team McKesson delivered on a really tremendous year. We continued significant momentum in advancing our strategy as reflected in the fiscal fourth quarter and full-year financial results. Full-year consolidated revenues grew 16% from the prior year, reaching a record level of $359 billion. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $33.05, exceeding our expectations. We delivered year-over-year EPS growth of 20%, which is above long-term growth targets of 12% to 14% EPS growth. We also generated strong cash flow and returned $3.5 billion of cash to shareholders. Underpinning the strong financial performance is our successful execution of our company priorities. I want to take a few minutes and highlight some examples of the incredible work Team McKesson has achieved this year. First, we made strategic acquisitions that will accelerate our strategy in Oncology and other specialties, including in a completed acquisition of a controlling interest in PRISM Vision and the pending acquisition of a controlling interest in Community Oncology Revitalization Enterprise Ventures or Core Ventures. These additions mark an important step as we continue our efforts to empower community-based providers and improve care experiences for patients. I'll share more about these acquisitions in just a moment. Secondly, we strengthened our core distribution capabilities through targeted investments in technology and infrastructure. Our team continues to deliver on operational excellence and quality customer service. Our differentiated customer value proposition is reflected in the successful onboarding of several new customers, including a new strategic partner during fiscal 2025. The last thing I'll mention is initiatives that we launched, that will accelerate and modernize the enterprise. Throughout the company, our teams are identifying and capturing opportunities, including the use of technology, automation, and AI that will allow us to strengthen the business platform, improve operational efficiencies, and enhance our financial profile, all while better serving our customers. This exceptional execution and growth are a testament to the hard work of our employees, and I'm grateful for their dedication, their passion, and their unwavering focus to advance our mission. The continuous advancement and successful execution of our strategy, along with our strong performance in fiscal 2025, has ensured a foundation for success as we look forward. Today, we initiated our fiscal 2026 guidance, reflecting our confidence to extend the momentum, further enhance our differentiated capabilities, execute on our strategy, and ultimately advance health outcomes for all. I want to focus my comments today on the strategies that have been, and we believe will continue to be, the center of our company's focus. And then I'm going to turn it over to Britt for more of the financial details, including the fiscal 2026 outlook itself. As always, let me start with our focus on people and culture, which underpins all of our success. We operate in an ever-evolving healthcare landscape where change, quite frankly, happens fast. It's important to me that we empower our employees with the right tools and the resources to drive innovation and improve efficiency. We provide training and skill development designed for employees at all levels of the organization, individual contributors, frontline managers, people leaders. We cover a range of skills, from managing and leading teams, to performance development, to technology and AI. Developing our talent creates an environment where our teams can better serve our customers, our customers' patients, and each other. We will continue this investment in our people as we invest to grow our future. Moving on to our two strategic growth pillars, Oncology and Biopharma Services. We continue to enhance our differentiated capabilities in our Oncology platform. In the past year, the U.S. Oncology Network welcomed two new practices, Illinois Cancer Center and Tennessee Cancer Specialists, growing the total provider count to over 2,700 across 645 sites in 31 states. Through these community-based oncology sites, more than 1.4 million patients receive high-quality care close to home every year. This past year, we announced an agreement to acquire a controlling interest in Core Ventures, a business and administrative services organization established by Florida Cancer Specialists & Research Institute. I'm pleased to share that we have cleared regulatory approval and expect to complete the acquisition on June 2, 2025, subject to customary closing conditions. After completion, Florida Cancer Specialists, along with its 530 providers, will become a member of the U.S. Oncology Network. One of the rising challenges of the cancer care experience is managing the sustainability of healthcare costs. In the past decade, we've invested in and we've supported the community-based oncology providers. We believe the community-based setting is an important channel that provides high-quality and lower-cost options to patients, including those in underserved communities. We have been a proponent of policies and reforms that will improve access to treatment in local communities and increase financial sustainability for patients. A good example of this is our participation in value-based care programs. The practices within the U.S. Oncology Network are leading the way in finding opportunities to reduce the treatment costs and enhance quality in oncology. 70% of the physicians in the U.S. Oncology Network participate in the Enhancing Oncology Model. At the network level, we support practices with the necessary resources and transformational strategies to excel in this initiative. In the recently reported first performance period, over 90% of the participating practices reduce cost versus benchmark, driving meaningful savings to patients and advancing the cancer care experience. Beyond opportunities in oncology, we're also building capabilities in other specialties where we see the opportunity for us to create differentiated platforms as we have done in oncology over the past decade. In April, we closed the acquisition of a controlling interest in PRISM Vision, a provider of general ophthalmology and retina management services. This is a quite logical expansion for us when we think about community-based care. We'll be able to build on the recent capabilities we've developed around the GPO and other value-added services in the ophthalmology and retina space. Our team is working diligently on integrating the business, and we look forward to this new growth opportunity for McKesson and supporting more practices to provide world-class eye care. Moving on to our Biopharma Services platform, the Prescription Technology Solutions segment delivered a strong year with double-digit growth in adjusted operating profit. Business growth was supported by continued strong demand for our access and affordability solutions, new business wins, and a growing network of digital connections to providers and pharmacies. In the past year alone, we helped patients save more than $10 billion on brand and specialty medications. We helped to prevent an estimated 12 million prescriptions from being abandoned due to affordability challenges, and we helped patients access their medicine more than 100 million times. Fiscal fourth quarter is typically the busiest time of year as we support patients with their annual verifications. This year, we delivered a particularly strong season, supporting a record number of 3 million patients in their journey to access the medicines they need. Our team achieved high levels of efficiency by leveraging technology to optimize processes and streamline the operation. As an example, in this past season, we were able to leverage our CoverMyMeds virtual assistant to automate more than 20% of chats within the patient support center, while importantly maintaining customer satisfaction scores equivalent to those of live agent interactions. As I reflect on our progress in enhancing our Oncology and Biopharma platforms, it's hard not to be proud of what Team McKesson has achieved. These two strategic growth pillars continue to represent attractive market opportunity, and we will continue to drive our mission forward with innovation, speed, and focus. Now, let me move on to our next strategic priority centered around, Disciplined Portfolio Management. We have a portfolio of differentiated assets, and as part of our continuous practice to evaluate the businesses for strategic alignment, which enabled us, in turn, have more focus and investment in our growth pillars and allows us to efficiently deploy capital. In the past, this has led to several actions like the spinoff of Change Healthcare, the divestiture of our European businesses, and most recently, the divestiture of the Canadian retail business. These actions have unlocked value for the business and created significant value for our shareholders. Today, we are announcing our intent to separate the medical surgical segment into an independent company. Over these past years, we have built a really great medical business focused on what we think are the most attractive markets in the alternate sites of care. We have a dedicated and experienced team that works closely with customers to provide the best quality of service. Since we started reporting this segment in fiscal ‘19, the business has delivered consistent and solid growth. As we continue to enhance our strategic focus, a separation transaction is an important step to focus capital deployment on opportunities that align with the long-term enterprise strategies and further invest in strategic growth areas like Oncology and Biopharma Services. We believe this action will unlock significant value for the medical business and for McKesson. It will result in two well-capitalized, at scale, world class companies that are well positioned to pursue their respective strategies and growth priorities. We expect the medical surgical business will continue to deliver exceptional value to its customers and patients as a differentiated medical surgical supply and solutions company. We have started the process to explore the right transactions. We anticipate providing you with additional information, including timeline and structure when appropriate. Britt will also share more details with you on the assumptions in the fiscal 2026 guidance. Moving on to our core distribution businesses, the U.S. pharmaceutical segment delivered strong performance with double-digit growth in revenue and adjusted operating profits. Our team demonstrated exceptional execution to support the significant growth of the business. We saw broad-based strength across the segment and stable market fundamentals, including solid pharmaceutical utilization trends. Our scaled capabilities in specialty distribution and our deep-channel expertise continue to position us well to support this fast-growing category of pharmaceuticals. The strength of our business is also a reflection of the strength of our customers. They are at the center of everything we do, and we're pleased to serve them as a pharmaceutical distributor and long-term strategic partner in enabling quality patient care. Our Canadian business, which makes up the majority of our international segment, also had a year of strong operational growth, led by the pharmaceutical distribution business. In the medical surgical segment, we finished the year in line with our expectations. We took effective actions to better align our service model and our capabilities with customer needs and the market demand. These actions delivered meaningful savings in fiscal 2025 and positioned this business for sustainable growth in the years ahead. As we look out and we look forward, we face a dynamic market environment with uncertainties in policies and the macroeconomic conditions. We continue to evaluate any potential impact to our company and make business planning decisions based on current policy and regulation. We're positioned with a strong sourcing program through a broad supplier base across the pharmaceutical and medical surgical businesses. The disciplined execution of our sourcing programs has delivered great value to our customers and allows us to remain focused on driving cost efficiencies and maintaining consistent product availability. Let me sum things up before I hand it over to Britt. We delivered a strong fiscal year results with record revenue growth and meaningful strategic advancement. We have a large and diversified portfolio of assets and driving 20% adjusted earnings per diluted share growth at the enterprise level takes tremendous focus, dedication, and disciplined execution. Thanks to the commitment of each and every member of Team McKesson, we're making remarkable progress in advancing our strategy and improving healthcare in every setting. Looking out, we have strong conviction in our strategy and our ability to consistently execute and deliver long-term value. Team McKesson is excited and committed to fulfill our mission and continue that momentum in fiscal ‘26 and beyond. With that, Britt, I'll hand it to you.
Britt Vitalone: Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon. Fiscal 2025 represents another year of outstanding financial results. As Brian talked about in his opening comment, we're executing against all pillars of our enterprise strategy. This includes disciplined portfolio management. Today's announcement of our intent to separate our medical surgical solution segment into an independent company aligns with our commitment to maximizing shareholder value. We anticipate a separation will allow McKesson and the new company to better focus on their strategies and more effectively deploy capital. The creation of these two world-class, well-capitalized companies that are well-positioned to pursue their respective strategic growth opportunities is a positive development and will unlock significant value for both companies. Turning now to our financial performance, my comments today will refer to our adjusted results. I'll start by discussing our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2025 results, then provide an overview of our fiscal 2026 outlook. McKesson delivered a strong fourth quarter, and as a result, we're exiting the year with significant momentum. We delivered earnings per diluted share of $10.12 in the fourth quarter and $33.05 for the full year, which exceeded the guidance range that we provided on our third quarter earnings call. Our fourth quarter results reflect continued strong execution as we work to advance our company priorities. Consolidated revenue in the quarter increased 19% to $90.8 billion, led by growth in the U.S. pharmaceutical segment due to increased prescription volumes from retail national account customers and growth in the distribution of specialty products, including higher volumes in oncology and other specialty provider settings. Gross profit was $3.4 billion, an increase of 2%, a result of specialty distribution and provider growth within the U.S. pharmaceutical segment, and growth in the prescription technology solution segment driven by our access and affordability solutions, partially offset by lower contributions in our international segment, a result of the divestiture of our Canada-based Rexall and Well.ca businesses at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2025. Operating expenses decreased 10% to $1.9 billion, driven by divestitures in the Canadian business and cost optimization initiatives in the medical surgical solution segment. To support future growth and create greater alignment across the medical segment and with its customers, we previously announced cost optimization actions in our medical segment. These actions have streamlined the infrastructure, increased focus, and driven operational efficiency, resulting in approximately $100 million of cost savings in the second half of fiscal 2025, with a higher proportion realized in the fourth quarter. These savings were in line with guidance previously provided. Operating profit was $1.6 billion, an increase of 24%. Year-over-year results benefited from growth across all operating segments, including strong oncology and other specialty provider volumes, the onboarding of a new strategic customer in the second quarter, and increased demand for access solutions in our prescription technology solution segment. Interest expense was $40 million, a decrease over the prior year, resulting from effective cash and portfolio management, including our derivative portfolio. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 13%, compared to 28% in the prior year, driven by the recognition of discrete tax benefits in the quarter. For the full year, the effective tax rate was within the guidance previously provided. Fourth quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $125.9 million, a decrease of 4%. The fourth quarter earnings per diluted share increased 64% to $10.12. Year-over-year growth was driven by a lower effective tax rate and strong operational growth across the business. Turning to fourth quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 8 through 12, and starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Revenues were $83.2 billion, an increase of 21%, driven by increased prescription volumes from retail national account customers and growth in the distribution of specialty products, including higher volumes in oncology and other specialty provider settings. Revenues from GLP-1 medications were $10.9 billion in this quarter, an increase of approximately $3.5 billion, or 46%, when compared to the prior year. On a sequential basis, GLP-1 revenue was flat. Segment operating profit increased 17% to $1.1 billion, driven by higher volumes from retail national account customers. This growth was further supported by the successful onboarding of a new strategic customer in our fiscal second quarter. Additionally, the distribution of specialty products, to oncology and other specialty providers and health systems contributed to growth. In the prescription technology solution segment, revenues increased 13% to $1.3 billion, and operating profit increased 34% to $285 million. Fourth quarter results reflect increased prescription transaction volumes, which drove higher demand for our access solutions, including prior authorization services for GLP-1 medications and our third-party logistics business. Additionally, a strong annual verification season, as Brian mentioned, contributed to these positive results. Total initiated prior authorization volume increased by 15% in the quarter compared to prior year. Turning to Medical Surgical solutions, the overall fiscal 2025 illness season was below the average of the past five non-COVID seasons. In the fiscal fourth quarter, illness season severity levels were moderately above those experienced in the prior quarter. Increased illness severity levels at the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter peaked in early February. In the fourth quarter, revenues were $2.9 billion, an increase of 1% driven by higher volumes of specialty pharmaceuticals, partially offset by lower primary care volume, customer mix, and product demand shifts across the primary care channel. Operating profit increased 15% to $285 million, reflecting the benefits and operational efficiencies from the cost optimization initiative announced in the first quarter. We're pleased with the results of these cost actions, enhancing financial performance and positioning the business to better serve our stakeholders and achieve sustainable growth. Next, let me address our international results. Revenues were $3.5 billion, a decrease of 2% resulting from the divestiture of our Canada-based Rexall and Well.ca businesses completed at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2025. Operating profit was $102 million, an increase of 9% driven by higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes in the Canadian business. Wrapping up our segment review with corporate. Corporate expenses were $165 million, a decrease of 15%. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we recorded a $0.09 per share reserve for environmental matters for increased remediation costs related to McKesson's former chemical business, which we disposed of several years ago. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, we also had higher interest income resulting from higher cash balances on average during the quarter and lower opioid related expenses. Let me turn to cash and capital deployment, which can be found on Slide 13. We ended the quarter with $5.7 billion in cash and cash equivalent and total liquidity of approximately $10 billion. During the fiscal fourth quarter, we delivered robust free cash flow, $7.5 billion. These results were driven by strong fourth quarter operating results and a timing shift from our fiscal third quarter to our fiscal fourth quarter drove the cash flow performance. Free cash flow included $278 million of capital expenditures, primarily related to investments in new and existing distribution centers, as well as investments in technology, data and analytics to support our growth priorities. In the fourth quarter, we returned $391 million of cash to shareholders, which included $300 million in share repurchases and $91 million in dividend payments. Let me take a moment and summarize our outstanding full year fiscal 2025 results, which exceeded our initial guidance. Additional details, including segment results, can be found in our press release. Fiscal 2025 revenues increased 16% to $359.1 billion, reflecting broad-based operational strength across the business, including the onboarding of a new strategic customer in our U.S. pharmaceutical segment. Operating profit of $5.6 billion increased 15% above the prior year, led by double digit growth in the U.S. pharmaceutical and prescription technology solution segment and our Canadian business within international. Operating profit also included $101 million in net gains related to the McKesson Ventures equity investment, compared to a loss of $24 million in fiscal 2024. Excluding the impact of net gains related to McKesson Ventures, operating profit increased 12% compared to the prior year, well above our long-range target. As a result of the strong operational growth across the business, combined with a lower share count, full year fiscal 2025 earnings per diluted share increased 20% to $33.05, exceeding our expectations. We continued our focus on cash flow generation, working capital management and capital deployment throughout fiscal 2025. This execution resulted in generating $5.2 billion in free cash flow, which included $859 million of capital expenditures, primarily related to investments to accelerate growth and modernize the business. We returned $3.5 billion to shareholders, including $3.1 billion through share repurchases and $345 million in dividends. Since the beginning of fiscal 2020, we've returned approximately $18 billion of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Of this amount, over $16 billion has been returned through share repurchases, reducing our total shares outstanding by 34%. Moving now to our fiscal 2026 outlook. Our strong finish in the fourth quarter and performance throughout the course of fiscal 2025 gives us confidence in our ability to continue the momentum and deliver strong results in fiscal 2026. The breadth of our capabilities and the leading portfolio of assets across oncology and biopharma services, along with our strong pharmaceutical distribution businesses, have led to value creation for our customers, partners, and shareholders over the last several years. We enter fiscal 2026 with a strong balance sheet, financial position, and significant liquidity, positioning us for continued growth. For fiscal 2026, we anticipate revenue growth of 11% to 15%, and operating profit growth of 8% to 12% compared to the prior year. For fiscal 2026, we anticipate earnings for diluted share of $36.75 to $37.55. This outlook represents approximately 11% to 14% growth year-over-year, which is 13% to 16% growth when excluding the net gain from the cuts and ventures in fiscal 2025, exceeding our long-range growth target of 12% to 14%. And today, we're reaffirming the long-term adjusted earnings growth target rate of 12% to 14%. Let me start with a review of our segment. In the U.S. pharmaceutical segment, we anticipate revenue and operating profit to increase 12% to 16%. As a reminder, we onboarded a new strategic customer at the beginning of fiscal 2025 in our second quarter. We now project total annual revenue of approximately $46 billion from this customer. As mentioned earlier, we anticipate continued growth to the GLP-1 category of medication, however, with variability from quarter-to-quarter. In fiscal 2025, GLP-1 revenues were $41 billion, an increase of 41% over fiscal 2024. We anticipate continued momentum in our core pharmaceutical distribution business, powered by the growth of specialty products, including continued growth in the distribution of specialty products to community providers. In fiscal 2025, we saw net additions of approximately 160 providers to the U.S. Oncology Network. Over the past three fiscal years, we've added approximately 725 providers to the U.S. Oncology Network. In fiscal 2026, we anticipate continued growth across our oncology and other specialty platforms, building on the growth of the U.S. Oncology Network, Ontada, and SCRI. Our fiscal 2026 outlook also includes the contribution from two recently announced acquisitions. On April 2, we completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in PRISM Vision Holdings, a premier provider of general ophthalmology and retina management services. McKesson has an approximate 80% ownership interest and will consolidate the results of operations within our U.S. pharmaceutical segment. We estimate PRISM will contribute $0.20 to $0.30 of adjusted earnings per share in fiscal 2026. The transaction to acquire a controlling interest in Core Ventures, an internal business and administrative services organization established by Florida Cancer Specialists and Research Institute, remains subject to customary closing conditions. The addition of Core Ventures will add approximately 530 providers to the U.S. Oncology Network, bringing the total number of providers to approximately 3,300. As a reminder, McKesson will purchase a controlling interest in Core Ventures for approximately $2.49 billion, which will represent approximately 70% ownership. We've made substantial progress and our outlook assumes that we will close this transaction in June of 2025. We estimate the acquisition of Core Ventures will contribute $0.40 to $0.60 of adjusted EPS in fiscal 2026. We expect to fund this transaction with permanent financing of approximately $2 billion and use cash to fund the remainder of the transaction. McKesson remains committed to maintaining its current investment grade rated status. We anticipate the acquisitions of Prism and Core Ventures will contribute approximately 6% to 7% to the fiscal 2026 operating profit growth in the U.S. pharmaceutical segment. As a result of the continued strength exhibited in fiscal 2025 and our confidence in this segment, we're raising the long term adjusted operating profit growth target from 5% to 7% to a new range of 6% to 8%. In the prescription technology solution segment, we anticipate revenues to increase by 4% to 8% and operating profits increased by 9% to 13%. This strong growth reflects the differentiated portfolio of solutions and is evident to strong market demand for our access and affordability solutions. It includes organic growth across the segment as we expand relationships with biopharma manufacturers and bring new brands to our platform. We anticipate the fiscal 2026 revenue growth rate to be slightly lower than the fiscal 2025 revenue growth rate driven by a slower rate of growth for third party logistics volumes. As a reminder, 3PL revenues contribute approximately 50% of the segment volume, and can vary from quarter-to-quarter driven by timing and the trajectory of new drug launches and the addition of new programs, which we serve. 3PL contributes less than approximately 5% to the segment operating profit. We anticipate continued contribution from prior authorization services. The GLP-1 medications drive an increased demand for our access and affordability solutions, contributing to the growth of the segment. We anticipate increased investment to support expanded access solutions, which include enhanced prior authorization capabilities for pharmacy and medical benefits. We're pleased with the consistent strength and performance in this segment. We'll continue to invest in the segment to develop new and adjacent solutions, and we're reaffirming the long term adjusted operating profit growth target for this segment of 11% to 12%. In the Medical Surgical Solution segment, we anticipate revenues and operating profit to increase 2% to 6% in fiscal 2026. We remain well positioned across all alternate sites of care, with a market leading breadth of services and solutions across medical, surgical, pharmaceutical, lab and home health solutions. As we've previously discussed, in fiscal 2025, we observed generally softer volumes in the primary care market, which included the impact of overall lower severity levels for the fiscal 2025 illness season. As we've previously discussed, each illness season is unique and the timing and severity level of each illness season can drive variability from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Additionally, we're pleased with the focus and discipline to accelerate the business and accelerate comprehensive cost optimization set of initiatives. These initiatives are driving operational efficiency, delivering improved focus and performance and greater alignment across the business and with our customers. As Brian and I have already discussed today, we've announced our intention to separate the medical segment into an independent company. This strategic decision is designed to enhance operational focus and further enhance strategic operations and opportunities of both companies. This decision is designed to unlock significant value for both companies. The new company would be a differentiated Medical Surgical Supply company with a compelling leadership position, attractive margins and potential for growth acceleration across all alternate sites of care. The separation is consistent with McKesson's disciplined portfolio management approach and will further focus capital deployment priorities for both companies. We're committed to exploring all opportunities to execute the separation in a manner that maximizes shareholder value. Our fiscal 2026 outlook assumes 100% ownership of the medical segment. We'll provide more information as appropriate on the form and timing as the process progressing. In the international segment, we anticipate revenues to be approximately a 2% decline to 2% growth and operating profits be flat to 5% decline. The segment outlook reflects continued growth in the Canadian distribution business, partially offset by the impact of the divestiture of our Canada-based Rexall and Well.ca businesses at the end of the third quarter in fiscal 2025. As a reminder, fiscal 2025 includes $25 million resulting from the held for sale accounting, related to the sale of our Canada-based Rexall and Well.ca businesses, which was completed on December 30, 2024. Our fiscal 2026 outlook contemplates contributions related to operations in Norway through calendar 2025. As a reminder, Norway remains the only operating country remaining in Europe. We remain committed to exit and fully divest our European business and have entered into an active sale process for our Norwegian business. We will, however, be disciplined and focused on maximizing shareholder values throughout the sale process. In the corporate segment, we anticipate expenses to be in the range of $570 million to $630 million. We continue to invest across the business to modernize and accelerate the enterprise to deliver growth. This includes significant investments in data and analytics, including several investments in cloud networking and infrastructure. Additionally, we anticipate accelerating the use of automation, including AI, to unlock the potential to deliver customer and foundational enhancement. Now, moving below the line. We anticipate interest expense to be approximately $255 million to $275 million, an income attributable to non-controlling interest to be in the range of $215 million to $235 million. The increase in the interest expense guidance range is compared to fiscal 2025, reflecting anticipated financing impact related to the acquisition of a controlling interest in core ventures. An income attributable to non-controlling interest guidance incorporates the full year impact from our controlling interest in PRISM Vision Holdings, and the estimated impact from the acquisition of a controlling interest in core ventures, as discussed earlier. We anticipate the full year effective tax rate will be in the range of 17% to 19%, and as a reminder, the timing and amount of discrete tax items are difficult to predict. Therefore, we do not provide quarterly effective tax rate guidance. Turning now to cash flow and capital deployment. We anticipate free cash flow of approximately $4.4 billion to $4.8 billion. Our working capital metrics and results in free cash flow will vary from quarter-to-quarter, and are impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of a quarter. Our outlook reflects plans to repurchase approximately $2.5 billion of shares in fiscal 2026, and as a result of the share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be in the range of approximately $124 million to $125 million. Our focus on portfolio management, including disciplined capital deployment, is reflected by the improvements in our return on invested capital. Over the past five years, return on invested capital has more than doubled to 26% to the end of fiscal 2025. This performance is a result of a clear and consistent enterprise strategy, operational execution against that strategy, and disciplined management of our portfolio of businesses. We'll continue to focus capital deployment on the growth strategies of oncology and biopharma solutions to create enhanced value for our shareholders. In summary, we delivered outstanding performance in fiscal 2025. The strength and stability in the underlying fundamentals across our businesses, combined with robust cash flow generation and disciplined capital deployment, have led to a strong outlook for fiscal 2026. Our sustained financial performance over the past several years has been bolstered by the strength of our financial position and the consistent operating execution, leading to compelling value creation for our customers, partners, and shareholders. I also want to take a moment to thank McKesson and McKesson's team of outstanding associates for the outstanding results that we had in fiscal 2025. I'm confident in our ability to deliver another strong year in 2026 with growth acceleration, margin expansion, and value creation. With that, we should move to the Q&A session.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS.
Kevin Caliendo : Thanks. There's so much to unpack here. I guess I'll be the bad guy and ask the MFN question, since it’s impacted the stock so much today. Can you help us just sort of understand that risk, meaning if there is some sort of Medicare Part B MFN impact to ASPs, which is kind of what the headlines have proposed? Could you just sort of help us understand, because it's 95% of all the questions I've got today? To understand how it would impact both the core distribution business and your specialty clinics business, if at all. I mean, a lot of us just don't really understand how the economics or the math work, and I think it would provide a ton of clarity if you can help us understand it.
Brian Tyler:  Thank you, Kevin. I'll go first. And my understanding, and admittedly, I haven't checked social media for a couple of hours, is that nothing has really been announced. It’s all kind of rumored at this point. And as history as our guide, there will probably be plenty of legal challenges, and so I think we'll have time to deal with this as actual facts emerge and not speculate on it. I will say, about the specialty providers. Our fundamental belief is, and I think this is definitely true. Community-based care is the most accessible. It is high quality and it is a low cost setting of care. So it is going to be a critical part of this country's ability to manage the overall accessibility, affordability and quality of care, particularly oncology care. And so our advocacy and our belief is that community-based care needs to be and will be fairly compensated in totality for the services that they provide. Whether that's through drug pricing structures or other service fees that are provided, it's absolutely essential that we have a vibrant community-based care setting. Otherwise, these patients, if they can get care, are going to be getting that care in a higher cost setting to the system overall. In terms of the distribution side of the business, I mean, I think we've always said, and we have successfully illustrated over the years, our ability to get paid fair value for the services that we provide, and that would be our expectation in this case as well.
Jeni Dominguez : Next question, please.
Operator: And our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JP Morgan.
Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Brian, just a comment to what you just said. I think if you look back at 2018, Trump proposed something kind of similar to shifting around potential payment on Part B and never came to fruition. So again, I think we're all watching this. Want to try to better understand this. Just two things – I'm sorry, go ahead.
Brian Tyler: I was going to say it was definitely a time warp moment.
Lisa Gill : It is. I feel like déjà vu if I have to keep writing these same research notes. But if we think about some of the other areas, I just want to make sure we also understand the tariff side on both sides of your business, so both, one on the branded as well as the generic side of the pharmaceutical. And then I know that ultimately you won't have the medical supply business. But in fiscal ‘26, can you talk about what you potentially have in your guidance around any tariffs, and if you'll have any impact on that side.
Brian Tyler: Sure, we can put [ph] nice and tag team this one. Obviously, we're closely monitoring the tariff landscape. And I'm sure everyone saw even as earlier today, the UK – a new UK agreement was announced. So it is pretty dynamic. I would, point back to our primary model. Let's start in the pharmaceutical business. We source from the brand. We have a reimbursement mechanism based on the price. Then we have a sell forward mechanism based on the price. Manufacturers are going to make the pricing decisions that they think they need to do. We don't think overall it's going to be material, and our assessment of the landscape has been considered in the guidance that we provided to you based on the policies that we're aware of and we know today. On the generic side, we're sourcers in the NorthStar program and we don't have fixed capital deployed in any country. You think about our sourcing program and even coming out of the COVID experience, we have been over time working to diversify, create a reliable, predictable supply chain, and we think we are pretty well positioned. We are not over rotated toward any one particular country, so I think we'll be okay there. And then on the medical surgical side, I would just say we have a similar sourcing strategy. I mean, we try to be diversified, resilient, have redundancy in that. We don't have a fixed plant anywhere. So we – as tariffs settle themselves out and we can move sourcing around to what would then be the most advantageous source. And then the last thing I would say is, by nature of our customer base in the markets that we serve, we tend to have flexibility around pricing. Our goal is always to provide the low cost best value that we can, but we have that as a lever.
Britt Vitalone: I would just add, I’d just maybe put a highlight on what Brian said. We do not anticipate this is going to have a material impact on our fiscal ‘26 guidance. It's our understanding of the tariff situation today. Obviously, it's evolving, but our understanding of it today, we have that incorporated into our guidance. And I would just also emphasize what Brian said, that in the medical business, as an example, we source the largest spend of products in the U.S. So we've continued for a number of years now to continue to diversify and focus on responsible sourcing. And in doing that, I think we have remediated a lot of the risks that we may have had several years ago.
Jeni Dominguez : Next question, please.
Operator: The next question comes from Allen Lutz with Bank of America.
Allen Lutz : Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the questions. One for Brian. With the separation of medsurge, clearly you guys are doubling down in U.S. pharma and prescription technology solutions. It feels like there's more urgency today to accelerate capital deployment in biopharma services. Can you just talk about the urgency that McKesson has here to focus on MSOs and building out McKesson's platform? Is that urgency that you are feeling bigger than it was, maybe one or two years ago? And then how big is the opportunity to continue to invest in this space? Thanks.
Brian Tyler: Yeah, great question. I mean, the first thing I'll say is that capital deployment for us is always driven by alignment to our strategy and financial discipline and executing those transactions. And I would say personally, the urgency hasn't changed for me at all. We've had the same level of urgency maybe earlier, you know a few years if I rolled the clock back, we had a difficult time finding valuations that we thought made financial sense and cleared our financial hurdles. We stay in those conversations. In this world, oftentimes these conversations go for years before they become actionable. So the urgency is always there to invest prudently against our strategy in a way that we're confident and will accelerate and continue our growth and to create shareholder value. It's really a matter of when you can execute on the opportunities.
A - Britt Vitalone: One thing I would add is, this is very consistent with the way that we've operated for several years. Again, to Brian's point, it's always started with strategy. So where we're deploying capital today is very consistent with our strategy. If you go back several years, we've continued to look at the portfolio and reallocate capital where it has the highest returns, where it has the highest opportunities, and it leverages our differentiated assets. We divested the Change Healthcare asset, we divested our European businesses, and most recently Rexall and Well.ca, all to get better alignment to our strategy and deploy our capital to differentiated assets with higher returns. This is very consistent with what we've done for several years.
Jeni Dominguez : Next question, please.
Operator: The next question will come from Eric Percher with Nephron Research.
Eric Percher : Thank you. Big picture question first on the pharma growth rate, long-term guidance moving up here. I would expect that relative to two years ago, the macro environment has been a real tailwind. And I'm curious to hear if the step-up in guidance reflects that you believe the macro environment stays that strong or if it is more to do with the opportunities that you are seeing based on the expansion of the platform and what you were just speaking about on capital deployment. And then Britt, I would ask you, pharma guidance for this coming year, 12% to 16%, that's a pretty large range. It sounds like core is in that. Help us understand what drives you from the bottom to the top in that range.
Brian Tyler:  So in terms of the macro environment, you know look, we feel really good about the value propositions we have for the customers we serve. We feel like we've onboarded some strategic customers over the last couple of years consecutively or we will. As we help them be successful, their growth will help us be successful. We've seen solid utilization trends. We think we've got a differentiated growth platform in oncology, and all these things can contribute to our view. I mean, the external environment today is probably – there's more moving parts than typically we would see. But if you step back further, healthcare is a pretty resilient industry. You know, the underlying core fundamentals continue to support growth, and we think the innovation will continue in the pharmaceutical segment and we'll be positioned to benefit from that.
Britt Vitalone: And Eric, before I answer your second question, this is the second time in the last few years that we've raised a long term guidance range for this segment. We started out at 4% to 6% and went to 5% to 7% and now 6% to 8%, and it's really a reflection of the things that Brian talked about. We're in a more stable environment for prescription utilization, and we've continued to build the platforms that we've been focused on in oncology and now other specialties. So I think it's a natural evolution of the way we've deployed capital in a very successful way to generate additional growth. If you think about the range for next year, as I mentioned in my comments, we've included two acquisitions into the growth of the segment for next year, which we anticipate will generate 6% to 7% of that growth, which means at the core, our assumption for next year is going around 6% to 9%, which is very consistent with the new range that we've provided on the long term growth rate. Again, I think that's continuing to add customers and getting operational efficiency in some of the investments that we've made to generate some operating leverage around automation, and we feel very comfortable that the business now is going to run at that 6% to 8% level.
Jeni Dominguez : Next question, please.
Operator: And the question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.
Stephen Baxter : Yeah, hi, just a couple of questions on the face of the P&L for this quarter. If we look at the, I guess the SG&A decline pretty substantially year-over-year, wondering if you could comment a little bit on the efficiencies there and what's driving that. And I guess also, looking at the gross profit side of things, maybe a little bit slower growth this quarter than you've seen kind of throughout the balance of the year. Also hoping you could potentially expand a little bit on the trends that we're seeing on those lines. Thank you.
Britt Vitalone: Yeah, thanks for the question, Stephen. On the expenses, one of the things that's really driving that is the divestiture that we have in our Canadian business. We divested the Rexall and Well.ca businesses in our third fiscal quarter. So that's having an impact on the year-over-year comparison there. From a gross profit perspective, I think that's more of a mix, as well as the divestitures that we had in our international segment. Overall, we're really proud and pleased with the operating leverage that we're generating in the business and that's showing up at the adjusted operating profit line.
Jeni Dominguez : Question, please.
Operator: And the question comes from Daniel Grosslight with Citi.
Daniel Grosslight : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I'd like to focus on your expectations around GLP-1 access programs in the near term. I think you mentioned for ‘26, you still expect that to be a strong contributor to growth in RxTS. It seems like there's a few puts and takes here, perhaps a little more onerous PA terms from an employer plan perspective on the insured side of things. But also Lilly and Novo seem to be really expanding their cash pay GLP-1 programs via LillyDirect to NovoCare, which obviates the need for PA. So just curious to get your thoughts on some of the puts and takes as we think about GLP-1s in your CoverMyMeds.
Brian Tyler: I'll start. So we, as you know, we provide prior authorization and other access solutions, quite frankly. So it's not just all about prior authorizations. And our expectation is that as more and more patients become clinically appropriate for these, to get started on these products, we will continue to benefit from that growth. Right now, the cash pay component, which we would not participate in is relatively small. We think it's a subset of the population that's eligible for it. And then the last thing I would say is, obviously the services we provide will vary depending on decisions that payers make in terms of how long they want to go between requiring prior authorizations, how frequently you have to have your prior authorization updated. And so as payers change their policies, as some employers choosing for the first time to start to cover weight loss, those are all the dynamics that go into it. When we step back and blend it all together, it delivers the kind of growth that Britt talked about.
Britt Vitalone: Yeah, just to add on to that, again, we finished the year with some very strong momentum, and we feel very confident that our programs continue to resonate. We support all the major GLP-1 products and we feel good about the momentum going into FY’26.
Jeni Dominguez : Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird.
Eric Coldwell : Thanks very much. Good afternoon. So I'm curious on prescription tech. It's very clear from your AOI growth, that the revenue growth slowdown forecast in fiscal ‘26 really is the 3PL. That's obvious. You normally talk about 3PL being around 50% of revenue. I'm just curious, what kind of a revenue slowdown are you seeing in 3PL, i.e., could we get a better sense on the growth forecast for the higher margin access affordability adherence businesses? That's it for me. Thanks.
Brian Tyler: Thanks, Eric, for that question. You know, we still see good growth in the 3PL business year-over-year. The rate of growth is what I was referring to. So we had a stronger rate of growth in our fiscal ‘25 for the 3PL business. So that rate of growth we do anticipate will slow, although we expect it to be more consistent with what we've seen historically. Overall, we are really feeling good about the access solutions and the growth rate that we're seeing there, particularly as we come out of a very strong fourth quarter in fiscal 2025. But it's really the rate of growth, the rate of growth is still, we believe solid, but it's just a slower rate of growth than we had in FY’25, which was a very strong year. As we've talked about before, it's really the timing of programs, the launch of products, all of those things go in and drive some variability with our 3PL revenue.
Jeni Dominguez : Question, please.
Operator: And the next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI.
Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question and congrats on the next quarter and outlook. I was wondering, you guys obviously have a big role in helping independent pharmacies in a variety of ways, including some of their PBM negotiations. Given some of the changing reimbursement models we're hearing about from the national change, has that kind of conversation percolated down to sort of the independent pharmacy customer base or is it not yet? And sort of what are they mostly focused on and asking you from the reimbursement perspective? Thanks.
Brian Tyler: Yes, so as you know, through our Health Mart program, we include service around reimbursement. We certainly continue to evaluate and understand the specifics and the mechanics of how some of these alternative reimbursement models work. As of yet, I wouldn't say there's been a big behavioral shift, but it's something that we're certainly tracking on. In terms of what our customers ask us for, they ask us to help them attract patients, marketing programs, etc. Help make sure their pharmacy is operationally as efficient as can be. Help make sure they have consistency of supply and competitive costs. Help them stay abreast of trends that are happening in the marketplace that they can manage their business as best they can, for example, by sharing best practices and growth strategies and drivers that we see throughout the portfolio of our 4,500 plus independent pharmacies.
Jeni Dominguez : We have time for one more question.
Operator: And that question will come from Charles Rhyee with TD Cowen.
Charles Rhyee : Oh yeah, thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess, Britt, maybe just on the guidance, free cash flow guide down from last year, can you help us bridge one of the pieces there? Is it just cash going out for Corp Ventures and Florida Cancer?
A - Britt Vitalone: Yeah, the cash flow guidance is still strong. Historically, it's above where we've trended over the last several years, so we feel really good about the cash flow generation. As I've talked about before, this is really a relation of timing, including the day that the quarter ends on or the year ends on. We did have a few non-operational cash flow items that came through at the end of our fiscal 2025. Not really material, but that will also impact the year-over-year. But we think that $4.4 billion to $4.8 billion of free cash flow is still very strong.
Brian Tyler: Great, thank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining our call and really appreciate your thoughtful questions. Thanks Justin for helping facilitate this call. McKesson delivered a strong fourth quarter and fiscal 2025. We are committed to build on this momentum, drive sustainable growth and deliver attractive shareholder returns in the years ahead of us. I certainly don't want to end this call without expressing my deep gratitude to our team of over 45,000 McKesson employees. It's their dedication to excellence and their care for our customers and each other that allow us to deliver these kinds of results, and I look forward to delivering more with them in the quarters ahead. Thanks, everybody. Hope you have a terrific evening.
Operator: Thank you. Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect and have a great day!

===== 2025 Q3  (2025-02-05 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to McKesson's Third Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Rachel Rodriguez: Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon and welcome everyone to McKesson's third quarter fiscal 2025 earnings call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move into a question-and-answer session. Today's discussions will include forward-looking statements such as forecasts about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com and to the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual report and other SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Information about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results can be found in today's earnings release and presentation slides. Presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and updated guidance. With that, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Rachel and good afternoon everybody. Thanks for joining the call. Earlier today, McKesson reported strong third quarter results delivering another quarter of double-digit growth and operating process. Our team executed against our company’s priorities with focus and unwavering dedication, thanks to their commitment we are expanding our differentiated capabilities driving operational efficiencies and creating real value for our partners and shareholders. Yesterday we were excited to announce the signing to acquire a controlling interest in PRISM Vision which is a provider at general opthamology and retina management services. This marks an important step as we continue to enhance our specialty services platform and capabilities. I’ll share additional details about the transaction a little later in my comments. But let’s move to the third quarter results. During the quarter, revenue grew 18% to $95.3 billion and adjusted operating profit grew 16% to $1.5 billion. Adjusted operating profit grew across all segments, led by strong double-digit growth in U.S. pharmaceutical and prescription technology solutions segments. In medical surgical growth was lower than anticipated, primarily driven by the late start of a softer illness season. The strength of the enterprise and the scale of our assets gave us the confidence to increase and narrow our full year guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share from $32.40 to $33 to a new range of $32.55 to $32.95 which represents 19% to 20% year-over-year adjusted EPS growth. Today I'm excited to share with you the great progress we've made in the past quarter, which is key to the financial results we delivered today and more importantly to the long run growth of the business. Then I'll turn it over to Britt for more details in the financial review. I want to start with our focus on talent and culture, which is foundational to our company strategy and everything we do here at McKesson. We value the breadth of backgrounds, experiences and skills of our team members and that includes our Board of Directors. Earlier this week, our Board of directors elected two new members to our board, Lynn Lynne Doughtie and Dr. Julie Gerberding. Miss Doughtie brings accounting and finance expertise from the board from her experience as the former Chair and Chief Executive officer of KPMG. Dr. Gerberding brings extensive executive experience in the healthcare industry and public policy arena. She was formerly the Chief Executive Officer or is currently the Chief Executive Officer of the foundation for National Institutes of Health and formerly the Executive Vice President and Chief Patent Officer at Merck and a former director of the CDC. Miss Doughtie will serve on our Audit Committee and finance committee and Dr. Gerberding will serve on a Compliance Committee and the Compensation and Talent Committee. These additions are yet another example of our best talent philosophy at work. We look forward to their leadership as we work together to continue to drive the growth of the company. Let's move on to our second priority that's strengthening the distribution capabilities and performance in North America. Within the US Pharmaceutical segment, utilization trends remain stable leading to solid volume growth in the underlying business. The strong performance in the quarter is underpinned by our scale distribution capabilities across multiple therapeutic areas and our ability to provide exceptional services to our customers. One of the channels we serve is community pharmacies, which play a critical role in bringing accessible care to patients. Recently we launched a strategic initiative to help protect critical pharmacy services and to elevate the pharmacy profession. We will provide funding support to eligible community pharmacy associations across all 50 states to help meet their advocacy goals and strengthen their voice in the community and the role of the community pharmacy industry. Within the medical surgical segment, we've strategically positioned this business to be focused on the alternate site markets. One of the market dynamics that impacts this segment is the annual illness, flu or respiratory season. Each illness season is unique, including its onset, its severity and how long it lasts. During the quarter, we observed lower than anticipated volumes related to the illness season which impacted the third quarter results. Market data shows that the number of flu like illness cases was lower than the average of the last five non COVID years and below the prior season. The softer illness season impacted the demand of seasonal vaccines, illness testing and foot traffic in primary care sites. This development, coupled with the general market weakness in the primary care channel we've called out for the prior two previous quarters, posed a challenging market backdrop for the segment. Despite the impact of the market trends, we remain confident in our strategy in the alternate site market and the strength of the underlying business. We continue to take immediate and effective actions to better align our service model and capabilities with our customer needs and the market demand. In the past quarter, we made important progress in the business rationalization initiatives that were previously announced. Thanks to the focus from our team, we're on track to complete the rationalization plan by the first half of fiscal 2026 and deliver meaningful savings as expected. Moving on to our two strategic growth pillars, oncology and biopharma services platforms. Over the years, we've continually invested and expanded our oncology assets in alignment with our stated strategy. The oncology market continues to be the largest growing therapeutic category and is one reason we continue to invest in this area. We have built a portfolio of assets that include distribution of oncology drugs and value added services that improve the cancer care journey. Through the US Oncology Network, we empower the delivery of advanced and integrated cancer care in the community setting which is often closer to home and more cost effective for the patient. We're pleased to see the continued expansion growing to over 2,750 providers across 640 sites of care in 31 different states. We provide resources and support to these community oncology practices to empower their growth and ultimately improve the patient experience and the outcomes of cancer care. We also provide clinical trial services to community based practices through the Sarah Cannon Research Institute Joint Venture which we often refer to SCRI. Last year the patient accruals through clinical trials increased 25% within SCRI. It participated in the development of 33 of the 47 therapies approved by the FDA. We're excited to bring more innovative and life changing therapies to community based practices and their patients. As we continue to advance our strategy, oncology and other specialties, we've also been evaluating opportunities in other therapeutic areas. Last year we acquired certain assets from US Retina and launched a new GPO program called Onmark Vision. We also have Retina OS, a clinical workflow and inventory management technology that streamlines inventory, revenue and payments management. All of these assets are building blocks for the acquisition that we announced yesterday. We're excited to sign an agreement to acquire a controlling interest in PRISM Vision. Its affiliated practices include 180 providers, 91 office locations and seven ambulatory surgery centers. Similar to our strategy oncology, we see an exciting opportunity in Retina and Ophthalmology given its attractive drug pipeline, the speed of innovation and practitioners needs for additional supporting services. We have a great track record of building and growing the oncology platform over the past several years. We're taking a similar approach to the expansion in Retina. We are strategic and thoughtful in building these platforms and creating a portfolio of assets that complement each other and reinforce each other. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including necessary regulatory clearances. We look forward to advancing Retina and ophthalmology patient care through a meaningful platform of distribution and other value added services. Onto our biopharma services platform, we offer a portfolio of solutions that connect biopharma companies, providers, pharmacies and payers to improve the access, affordability and adherence of medications. In the third quarter, the Prescription technology solutions segment delivered strong performance in line with our expectations. Growth accelerated in the quarter reflecting strong demand across our product solutions. One of our value add solutions is prior authorizations, which automate the process and give patients access to their prescriptions faster. But in addition to prior authorizations, we're seeing continued growth from many other solutions. In the fiscal third quarter, we added access and affordability support for pharma brands that span across 30 indications and more than 12 therapeutic areas. We're pleased to support a diversified portfolio of brands with their unique needs and ultimately make these medications more accessible and affordable to providers and patients. Biopharma Services is a strategic growth pillar for us and we continue to invest strategically to support its growth. In the past few quarters, we've updated the user interface of our key customer systems, enhanced the core technical infrastructures and improve the overall user experience. These updates help us support customers and a more efficient manager as we ramp up the annual verification programs in our fiscal fourth quarter. Looking across our business segments, we've built a large and a diversified portfolio of assets. It is part of our continuous practice to assess this portfolio for strategic alignment. In December, we completed the divestiture of the Rexall and Well.ca businesses. This allows us to focus and prioritize investments in other strategic areas. As Canada's largest pharmaceutical distributor, we continue to invest and modernize our distribution network, introducing automation and technology to improve efficiency. We're also growing a set of biopharma solutions that include third party logistics, patient care services and data insights. So let me try to sum up the quarter. McKesson delivered strong quarterly results in fiscal 2025. Three of our four business segments grew adjusted operating profit at double digit rates in the quarter. That represents over 80% of our business, growing AOP in double digits and highlights the strong momentum across the enterprise the fundamentals of our business remain strong and we're taking strategic actions to enhance our differentiated portfolio, to drive operational efficiencies and to modernize the enterprise. We're confident in our market positions and pleased with the momentum we're building across the business. Looking ahead, we're focused on delivering a strong finish to fiscal 2025 and driving sustainable long-term growth in the years ahead. With that, I'll hand it over to Britt for some additional insights and comments.
Britt Vitalone: Thank you Brian, and good afternoon. My comments today will refer to our adjusted results. We'll start with consolidated results followed by a review at the segment level and conclude with an update on our full year fiscal 2025 outlook. We reported another strong quarter with notable momentum across the enterprise. We're pleased to report record quarterly revenue and operating profit, including year-over-year operating profit growth in each segment. These results demonstrate the remarkable breadth of McKesson's products and services and reflect the focus and execution against our company priorities. Consolidated revenues increased 18% to $95.3 billion, led by growth in the U.S. pharmaceutical segment due to increased prescription volumes from retail national account customers and growth in the distribution of specialty products, including higher volumes in oncology and specialty provider settings. Gross profit was $3.3 billion, an increase of 7%, primarily a result of specialty distribution and provider growth within the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment and growth in the prescription technology solutions segment driven by our access and affordability solutions. Operating expenses increased 2% to $1.9 billion, driven by higher expenses to support growth in the U.S. pharmaceutical segment. We're pleased with the focus on driving a lower operating cost structure, implementing efficiencies through automation and data capabilities, and delivering insights to improve our operations, products and service offerings. This is reflected in the operating expense to gross profit ratio, which improved over 250 basis points as compared to the prior year. Operating profit was $1.5 billion, an increase of 16%. Year-over-year results benefited from growth across all segments. Interest expense was $62 million, an increase over the prior year resulting from higher average balances of our loan portfolio during the quarter. The effective tax rate was 23.9% compared to 10.6% in the prior year. This rate was in line with the guidance provided at recent Investor industry conferences. Third quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $126.6 million, a decrease of 5%. In third quarter earnings per diluted share increased 4% to $8.03. Year-over-year growth was driven by strong operational performance and a lower share count, partially offset by a higher tax rate resulting from discrete items in the quarter. Turning to third quarter segment results, which can be found on slides 8 through 12 and starting with our U.S. pharmaceutical segment. Revenues were $87.1 billion, an increase of 19%. Revenue growth was led by higher volumes from retail national account customers, growth from specialty product distribution, including higher volumes from oncology and specialty provider settings, and partially offset by the anticipated decline of a certain of certain brand volumes due to formulary changes by a retail national account customer beginning in our fiscal 2025 first quarter. Revenues from GLP-1 medications were $10.9 billion in the quarter, an increase of approximately $3.4 billion or 45% when compared to the prior year. We anticipate continued GLP-1 medication growth year-over-year, however, with variability from quarter-to-quarter, operating profit increased 14% to $944 million, driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to health systems and specialty providers, the onboarding of a new strategic customer and growth in our differentiated oncology platform, partially offset by expected lower distribution volumes of COVID-19 vaccines as compared to the prior year. In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, organic and new program growth across our access and affordability solutions led to strong growth compared to the prior year. Revenues increased 14% to $1.4 billion and operating profit increased 22% to $235 million. Third quarter results reflect increased prescription transaction volumes which drove higher demand for our access solutions, including prior authorization services for GLP-1 medications and growth in our third party logistics business. Year-over-year growth was also supported by increased sales to new customers and programs across our access and affordability solutions. Turning to Medical Surgical solutions, as Brian mentioned earlier in his remarks, we observed lower than anticipated volumes due to less demand for illness season products. As we've previously discussed, each illness season is unique and the timing and severity level of each illness season could drive variability from quarter-to-quarter. Through the fiscal third quarter, this illness season had lower severity levels compared to prior years and lower than our expectations, impacting foot traffic in the primary care settings that we serve. As measured by IQVIA data, illness severity was approximately 62% of the average of the previous five non-COVID illness seasons. In the third quarter, revenues decreased 3% to $2.9 billion. The decline in revenues can be attributable to the lower levels of seasonal vaccines, illness testing and related medical surgical supplies in the primary care channel. Operating profit increased 4% to $294 million, driven by operational efficiencies from the cost optimization initiative that we announced in Q1 and growth in the extended care business. These are partially offset by lower contributions in the primary care channel as compared to the prior year. As we previously guided, we anticipate the cost optimization initiatives will deliver $100 million of cost savings in the second half of fiscal 2025, with a higher proportion coming in the fourth quarter. We're pleased with the execution to date and we remain confident in achieving these savings. Next, let me address our International Results. Revenues were $3.9 billion, an increase of 6% and operating profit was $124 million, an increase of 18% driven by higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes in the Canadian business. Operating profit included $19 million or $0.11 of earnings accretion resulting from the held for sale accounting related to the sale of our Canada based Rexall and Well.ca businesses which was completed on December 30th of 2024. Wrapping up our segment review with Corporate. Corporate expenses were $134 million which included a pretax gain of $6 million or $0.04 per share related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio compared to pretax losses of $8 million or $0.05 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Let me turn to cash and capital deployment which can be found on slide 13. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. During the quarter, we had negative free cash flow of $2.6 billion. Timing, including the day of the week that the quarter ended on led to approximately $2 billion of cash shifting from our fiscal third quarter to our fiscal fourth quarter. This does not impact our full year free cash flow guidance. Additionally, free cash flow included $196 million of capital expenditures primarily related to investments in new and existing distribution centers, as well as investments in technology, data and analytics to support our growth priorities. In the third quarter, we returned $919 million of cash to shareholders, which included $827 million of share repurchases at an average price of $537 per share, and we made $92 million in dividend payments. Now let me discuss our updated fiscal 2025 outlook. As a result of our third quarter performance and the confidence that we have in the outlook for the remainder of the year, we're raising and narrowing our guidance range for fiscal 2025 adjusted earnings per diluted share to $32.55 to $32.95. Our strategy continues to yield exceptional results led by the growing and differentiated oncology and biopharma services platforms supported by a foundation centered on a strong core of distribution assets. In the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment our core pharmaceutical distribution operations continue to demonstrate a diversified and strong value proposition to customers. We anticipate revenues to increase 18% to 20% and operating profit to increase 11% to 13%. This updated segment outlook incorporates strong third quarter performance as well as continued momentum in the core distribution business, including stable utilization trends, performance of our sourcing program and continued growth in specialty pharmaceuticals. We continue to be pleased with the strategic partner we announced and onboarded in July. This partnership is a testament to our leading distribution and sourcing capabilities and our strong customer value proposition. We anticipate the strategic partnership will contribute approximately $32 billion of incremental revenue in full year fiscal 2025 and it's incorporated in the full year Outlook. Our oncology platform is delivering across a range of capabilities including distribution, practice management, data and analytics, and clinical research. More than 2,750 providers in the U.S. Oncology Network continue to experience solid growth, with same site visits increasing 6% in the quarter. And yesterday we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire controlling interest in PRISM Vision Holdings, a premier provider of general ophthalmology and retina management services. This transaction advances McKesson's specialty position and our commitment to improve and expand patient access to quality community care. We intend to develop a leading platform for retinal care delivering differentiated solutions and value across providers, biopharma partners and patients. McKesson's long track record of leading practice management and clinical research outcomes with our differentiated oncology platform will allow us to expand our suite of solutions and continue to pursue our purpose of advancing health outcomes for all. McKesson will purchase an 80% ownership interest for approximately $850 million. We anticipate financing the transaction with a mixture of cash and debt. Following completion of the transaction, PRISM Vision will be part of McKesson's broad set of specialty solutions and financial results will be consolidated within McKesson's U.S. pharmaceutical segment. Upon closing, PRSIM is anticipated to be approximately $0.20 to $0.30 accretive to McKesson's adjusted earnings per diluted share in the first 12 months post-closing and $0.65 to $0.75 accretive by the end of the third year following the close of the transaction. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including necessary regulatory clearances, and we've not included any financial results from this transaction in our updated fiscal 2025 outlook. In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we anticipate revenues to increase 9% to 12% and operating profit to increase 12% to 15%. The updated outlook incorporates a strong third quarter performance and affirms our confidence in achieving operating profit growth at or above the long-term growth rate target in fiscal 2025. As we've previously communicated, we anticipate revenue and operating profit growth will not be linear and will vary from quarter-to-quarter, driven by several factors including the timing and trajectory of new product drug launches utilization trends, the evolution of a product's program support requirements as it matures, which could result in the shift to other services or program termination, product delays and supply shortages payer requirements including utilization management and formulary strategies, the annual verification programs that we provide for our customers that occur in our fiscal fourth quarter, and the size and timing of investments to support and expand our product portfolio. Moving to Medical Surgical Solutions. During the third quarter, we observed lower than anticipated illness season volumes, including vaccines and testing, and lower volumes in the primary care channel, which negatively impacted third quarter results more than originally anticipated. As a result of third quarter performance in our revised outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, we now anticipate revenues and operating profit to be roughly flat to the prior year, a result of the weaker than anticipated illness season. Despite these macro challenges, we have made progress toward our previously announced cost optimization initiatives, which have already begun to drive anticipated operational efficiencies in the segment. We continue to anticipate these initiatives will deliver approximately $100 million in cost savings in fiscal 2025 as previously outlined, and will be more heavily weighted toward the fourth quarter. In the International Segment, we anticipate revenues to increase 3% to 7% and operating profits increase 10% to 14%. As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, we completed the sale of our Canada based Rexall and Well.ca businesses at the end of the third quarter. This transaction closed earlier than we had previously anticipated, negatively impacting operating profit guidance, and is the main driver behind the change in guidance for the segment. We also remain committed to exit and fully divest our European business. As a reminder, Norway remains the only operating country in Europe that we've not entered into an agreement to sell, and contributions related to operations in Norway are included in the fiscal 2025 outlook for the segment. We intend to exit Norway as part of the completion of our European exit. Finally, in the corporate segment, we anticipate expenses to be in the range of $480 million to $520 million, which incorporates the impact of $6 million of pretax gains related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio in the third quarter. As a reminder, McKesson Ventures impact on consolidated financials can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment quarter-to-quarter, which may result in gains and losses, the timing and magnitude of which can vary for each investment. Moving below the line, we anticipate interest expense to be approximately $255 million to $265 million, reflecting higher than anticipated interest expense in the third quarter and anticipated additional borrowing activities driven by the timing of working capital in the fourth quarter. We anticipate income attributable to non-controlling interest to be in the range of $185 million to $195 million owing to the success of ClarusONE's generic sourcing operations. We anticipate the full year effective tax rate will be in the range of approximately 17% to 19%. And turning to cash flow and capital deployment, we remain focused on shareholder value creation and our disciplined capital deployment approach remains unchanged. It starts with stable and growing free cash flow. For fiscal 2025, we anticipate free cash flow of approximately $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion. Next, we'll continue to deploy capital to grow the business on strategy. The acquisition of PRISM Vision is a good example of this. Secondly, we'll return capital to our shareholders through a growing dividend and value creating share repurchases. Our guidance includes plans to repurchase approximately $3.2 billion of shares in fiscal 2025. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 128 million. And finally, we'll maintain a strong balance sheet with stable credit ratings. Wrapping up fiscal 2025 guidance we anticipate revenue growth of 16% to 18% and operating profit growth of 13% to 15% compared to the prior year. For fiscal 2025, we anticipate earnings per diluted share of $32.55 to $32.95, which represents approximately 19% to 20% growth as compared to fiscal 2024. Before I close, I'd like to share some initial thoughts on fiscal 2026. We anticipate our operating momentum to persist. As Brian mentioned earlier, approximately 80% of the operating profit of the company is growing at double digit growth rates in fiscal 2025. As a result, we maintain confidence in the long-term adjusted EPS target of 12% to 14% growth. In U.S. Pharmaceutical there's several positive items that we anticipate will continue to support growth in fiscal 2026. These include the scale and efficiency of our pharmaceutical distribution operations, our leading position in specialty, including the breadth of our oncology platform, the U.S. Oncology network, GPO services, Ontada and the Sarah Cannon Research Institute. The growth of other specialties in areas like retina and ophthalmology, which include the recently announced acquisition of PRISM Vision and our leading generics offerings including the strength of ClarusONE. We anticipate that the strength we're seeing across the prescription technology solutions segment will continue to benefit from our leading products and capabilities supported by several factors which would include stable utilization trends, differentiated access and affordability programs, Unmatched connectivity as our solutions are in the workflow of over 950,000 providers and more than 50,000 pharmacies and the innovative products and services supported by ongoing investments. Our medical surgical solutions segment is well positioned as care continues to move across the alternate site settings. We're confident that the cost optimization actions we've taken will better align our business to the markets and customers that we serve. We'll continue to evaluate the environment as the illness season progresses, as primary care markets continue to stabilize and the overall impacts from our early cost optimization efforts materialize. Finally, we'll continue to invest in adding capabilities to our North American distribution footprint. These investments include increased capacity, automation and regulatory excellence capabilities. We are modernizing the enterprise and we're investing in data and analytics, including the acceleration of several investments in cloud, networking and infrastructure. We're also accelerating the use of AI to unlock the potential to deliver customer and foundational enhancements. We're using AI to improve the customer experience and improve productivity, including supply chain disruptions, predictions, forecast accuracy algorithms and fraud detection. In closing, our third quarter results represent another strong performance with operating profit growth across all segments demonstrating remarkable execution against our strategic growth pillars. Through the durability of our business models, the scale and differentiation across our solutions and services in the investments we're making to modernize and accelerate the enterprise, we're committed to delivering value creation. We're confident in McKesson's bright future. We have leading positions across distribution and biopharma services driven by our execution and innovative solutions. Before turning to Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to thank Rachel Rodriguez. Rachel's taking a new role on our corporate FP&A team. I'd like to thank Rachel for her positive impact leading investor relations for the past three and a half years, and the partnership with both Brian and me. And I'd like to welcome Jenny [ph] Dominguez who will now be leading the investor relations team. Jenny has a long track record in several leadership positions across our finance teams at McKesson. And with that, let's move to the Q&A session.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question.
Eric Percher: Thank you. Eric Percher from Nephron Research. I appreciate the detail on 2025 and early view of 2026. Brian and Brooke, can I ask you, it sounds like you expect the utilization levels you've seen driving pharma and specialty continue and the growth rate elevation. How much of that do you attribute to the macro trends versus what is unique about your specialty business and any areas where we should have concern about the ability to carry on into next year? And then the final piece I'd ask is, is there any area where IRA is impacting your business today?
Brian Tyler: I'll start Eric, and thanks for the question. I mean I think we've seen pretty stable and consistent overall prescription volume in the pharma segment the last several quarters. Obviously specialty in oncology in particular has been strong. We've been benefiting from the growth in GLP-1s but I think as we scan the environment today, other than some quarter-to-quarter volatility in GLP-1s which could be hard to predict, we, we think the environment will continue to be sort of pretty steady and as has been obviously FY25 is playing out very consistent with our expectations. The growth in the U.S. Oncology network has been solid and is clearly a driver and our set of differentiated assets there is helping us. We've had 6% same store patient growth and then obviously we augment that over the course of the last several years with practice, new practice members joining the U.S. Oncology network. So I think that has been a position of strength and will continue to be for us.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question please?
Operator: And the next question will come from Kevin Caliendo with UBS.
Kevin Caliendo: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess I just wanted, I'm a little confused on the commentary that you had for fiscal 2026. Are you actually sort of blessing that we should take the guidance from 2025 and given the variables that you described for the segments, be comfortable with that. You're comfortable with an earnings growth rate of 12% to 14%. And if, if so is that inclusive of the deals that you've announced already that haven't closed yet?
Brian Tyler: Kevin, thanks for the question. Let me clarify that. What we wanted to try to do was give you some of the qualitative factors that we see supporting the business this year that we would, we would expect qualitatively will be a part of the algorithm next year. We are giving you the long term EPS growth rate. We're affirming that at 12% to 14%. We feel comfortable with that. Obviously as we get to our fourth quarter earnings, we'll give you a more detailed breakdown by, by each segment. Like qualitatively, a lot of the factors that we see driving the business should be in place next year. We think that will support the long-term adjusted EPS growth rate of 12% to 14%. In terms of the acquisitions, I'll just remind you that they're subject to customary regulatory closing conditions and review. We did give you the first 12 months accretion when those deals do close. But obviously, they haven't closed. They're still going through the customary regulatory review process, but we feel comfortable in at least providing you the accretion for the first 12 months and then after that.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question please?
Operator: And the next question will come from Allen Lutz with Bank of America.
Allen Lutz: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. One for Britt. 2% operating expense growth in the quarter that's really strong. As we look at the different segments, there does seem to be some variability by segment. I think you're investing in RxTS and there's some cost cuts in MedSurg. Can you talk about the big drivers and some of the variability within segments to get to that 2% OpEx growth? And how to think about, what's embedded in 4Q and maybe exiting 4Q, how you're thinking about operating expense growth?
Britt Vitalone: Yes. Thanks for that question, Allen. I think we've talked about this back in November when we had our sell-side update. One of the things that we've really focused on for the last several years is driving operating leverage into the business. And we've seen our ability for us to do that over the last several years, getting operating efficiency in our North American distribution businesses and clearly focusing on investments to drive better data and analytics, better sourcing, better capabilities from our operations. So we are getting more efficient. We are driving more leverage and more throughput through the organization, but at the same time, investing back in key areas. Key areas like RxTS, where we're putting investments to play to support additional products and services and capabilities. And you should expect us to continue to do that. So generally speaking, driving great operating leverage through getting efficiencies, automation, data and analytics capabilities, but we will continue to invest against our growth strategy to RxTS being one of those.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question please?
Operator: And our next question will come from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Again, Ms. Anderson, your line is open, perhaps you're on mute. Our next question will come from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey good afternoon guys.
Brian Tyler: Good afternoon.
Brian Tanquilut: Just a quick 2-parter. Brian, as I think about the medical side of the business, how are we -- I guess the seasonality factor that has impacted that. But how are you thinking about market share in that segment or that industry? And then maybe, Britt, really quickly on PRISM. Who is a distributor for PRISM currently? Is that incremental business coming in for you guys? Thanks.
Brian Tyler: No, I mean, in terms of the medical business, just to remind everybody that years ago, we shifted the strategy of this business to be focused on the alternate-site locations. Physician office, specialty clinics, long-term care, urgent care clinics, retail care clinics. And so that's -- when you talk about market share, it's really hard to get definitive market share in the alternate site markets. But it's clear we have a leading positions in those marketplaces. We're probably a lot less focused on market share than just growing customer base, expanding share of wallet. A part of the strategy in this business over the years has been to evolve from just commodity medical products to more sophisticated medical products, the lab, pharmaceuticals, kind of all things that these alternative site locations need to support the practice of medicine that they're providing there. So we're quite confident in our capabilities, the breadth of those capabilities, including our private label programs. So we think that, that's what supported our great share position in those markets.
Britt Vitalone: And to quickly answer your question on PRISM, we are not the distributor today. We would pick that business up, and it's included in the accretion numbers that we provided you.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question please?
Operator: The next question will come from Charles Rhyee with TD Cowen.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Lucas [ph] on for Charles. I wanted to ask about the MedSurg segment and kind of the outlook for 2026. The midpoint of your implied guide for implies an exit rate -- growth rate of about 13% to 14%. I guess, one, how much of this strong growth rate incorporates an uptick in the respiratory illness uptick in flu cases to start the year? And then for fiscal 2026, just thinking about the growth rate and the moving pieces there. Are we obviously expecting $100 million worth of costs lapping and cost optimization benefit in 2026? But also too, when you guys initiated your guidance last May, you kind of highlighted investments made in the MedSurg segment driven around 2 percentage points worth of growth. So maybe confirm that still an ongoing process and that we can potentially lap that in 2026? Thanks.
Britt Vitalone: Yes. Thanks for your question. I'll make a couple of comments here. We have not provided specific guidance for any of our segments at this point for FY 2026. We have seen a softer flu season and less demand for illness season in general and for those illness season products. We're not making any prediction on the remainder certainly on next year's illness season. We are pleased with our efforts thus far in the cost optimization initiatives, and we do anticipate that we'll get those $100 million of savings this year. And clearly, we're continuing to work on the business and get it aligned correctly with our customer base and the markets that we serve. And that's something that we'll just continue to focus on. We have seen softer volumes in the primary care channels and settings that we serve, and we'll continue to evaluate that, as I mentioned in my comments, we're going to evaluate the markets and the -- how the illness season plays out for the rest of this year and continue to evaluate our cost optimization efforts as they materialize through the end of the year. So what I could tell you is that clearly, we are seeing a soft illness season. That's impacting other components of our volumes in the primary care channel settings, but we're pleased with the efforts on the cost optimization initiatives this year.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question please?
Operator: Certainly. The next question will come from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa Gill: Thank you so much. Britt, I wanted to follow up on a comment that you made around brand changes. And I'm assuming that talking about formulary changes that pertains to PBMs and you have 2 large mail order pieces of business with both Optum and Caremark. I just sort of want to understand, as we see those changes, I'm assuming it's around things like Humira, as we move into 20 -- your fiscal 2026 or calendar 2025, we're going to have Celera [ph] where we'll have a biosimilar. So really my question is two things. One, is it that you're calling out that's a revenue impact, but you're still going to distribute the product and so you've got potential better margin on that biosimilar? Or is it more that we're seeing some of these players actually self-distribute something on the biosimilar side. And therefore, that could be a headwind as we move into more biosimilars? I just want to understand that in general and how we should think about that going into next year. As you look at the formulary changes for all the big PBMs and the changes that they're making.
Britt Vitalone: Yes. Thanks for the question, Lisa. This is a very similar comment that I made in prior quarters this year. This is one particular product that did go biosimilar. And the -- there was a formulary change made by a large retail national customer of ours. It's a revenue issue for us, and all I'm doing is calling that out as a revenue impact in this particular quarter. Not making any comments on other products that may go off brand and go biosimilar. We'll see how those play out as time goes on. But this is the same the same issue that we called out in the first quarter. It's a revenue issue on one product with one particular customer.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question please?
Operator: Thank you. The next question will come from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.
Stephen Baxter: Hi, thanks for the question. I appreciate all the color on the factors of the business that you feel reasonably confident are going to persist into fiscal 2026. Just as we think about the earnings baseline, are there things that you think we should be thinking as a potential maybe adjustments to the baseline and maybe potential headwinds as you move into fiscal 2026? Or anything you might describe as more of a swing factor approach to keep in mind? Thank you.
Britt Vitalone: Yes. I appreciate that question. Look, I think there's a few things that are somewhat analogous to this year. Clearly, we've onboarded a large strategic customer in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business that was onboarded in our -- beginning of our second quarter. And I think other than that, we really are very pleased with strong utilization, as Brian mentioned, in our pharmaceutical distribution as well as in our specialty businesses. We continue to make good progress in our specialty areas, such as oncology. As Brian has talked about here, we've added 185 providers this year, which is really a high watermark for us over the last several years. We're seeing really good same site visits going through those provider bases. So I think -- as you think about the year, clearly, there are a couple of items such as adding a large strategic partner. But generally speaking, the businesses are performing in line with or slightly above our long-range targets, and we're really pleased with that performance.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question please?
Operator: Next question will come from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.
Erin Wright: Hey thank you. A follow-up on PRISM. Just how do you think about the opportunity across general ophthalmology versus the retina business? I understand it has kind of both -- I think there's more of a pharmaceutical angle from a retina perspective, but how do you think about that and the potential synergies, the opportunities around biosimilars like EYLEA [ph]? And you mentioned some of the initiatives in the space like on Mark from a vision perspective. And are there other investments that you need to make or build out kind of in and around this space? And is this an area that from a disclosure standpoint, and I think one of your peers will be doing this is, is breaking this out, whether it's PRISM or U.S. oncology or think you got greater disclosure around some of those MSO businesses? Thanks.
Brian Tyler: I'll start, and then Britt, you can complement my comments. I think the one thing that attracted us to PRISM was their approach to coordinated care and treating the full spectrum of eye care, retina, general ophthalmology and ambulatory surgery centers. So they're a provider for general ophthalmology and retina centers. And as you think about our strategy and the evolution of our strategy here. We started by acquiring some assets in GPO and some software called retina OS which I described in my opening comments. And so we began to build pieces of the platform. And as we reflect on the success we've had in oncology over the last 1.5 decades, and the measured way we grew that and started with drug distribution into GPO services and then just continue to augment clinical trial services, data and analytics services. We've been waiting and studying and looking for an adjacent market that had, we saw a strong pipeline of drug growth. We saw less practices where we could bring these value-add services to help the physicians practice medicine better. And so we think this is a terrific opportunity. And one thing we're excited about is we feel like, based on our experience with oncology, we really know what to look for the group that practices medicine, in this case, in ophthalmology and retinology to a very specific philosophy that wants to move together, the practices on a common practice management system. So we've all got integrated data. And so we very much look at this augmented with the distribution we already do, the GPO services we already do, the other services we already provide and the tools we have as building out now this analogous platform. Not exactly the same as U.S. oncology. It's tailored for retinology and ophthalmology, but it's very much sort of an analogous strategy.
Britt Vitalone: Maybe I'll address your question on disclosure. You always look to enhance our disclosure where appropriate. We've begun to give you some sense of the oncology platform and the pieces in that platform. You might recall at our sell-side update. We talked about all the building pieces from distribution through practice management and GPO, our data and analytics business all the way through to Sarah Cannon and some of the clinical trial capabilities that we have. And we outlined for you the revenue for fiscal 2025 from that platform is about $35 billion. Now we've announced a few transactions here, but we haven't closed those. And so as we get to a point where hopefully we can close these transactions. We'll evaluate whether it's necessary for us to do some further disclosure. But at this point in time, I think we feel comfortable that we're providing a good level of data to support some of the commentary in some of our strategies around the oncology platform.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question please?
Operator: Moving on to George Hill with Deutsche Bank.
George Hill: Hey good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the questions. And two very quick ones for Britt. Britt, number one is the recognition of the cost savings in the Medical segment for the back half of this fiscal year seems to be nonlinear. I'm wondering if we can annualize the Q4 part versus the Q3 part looking forward? And then the other part is Britt. I just want to give you a chance to talk about whether or not there's any headwinds for fiscal 2026 because some first blush, everything sounds great.
Britt Vitalone: Yes. Thanks, George. Look, we haven't given any guidance, obviously, on what those cost optimization initiatives will yield in 2026. Clearly, we've given you a piece it for FY 2025. And these are -- we would expect these to be more than temporary cost savings. So I'll just leave it at that. In terms of headwinds, look, I think we we've talked about certainly public policy as a wildcard for us. It's not something that we control. But certainly, we watch it. We think that we're well informed in helping educate policymakers. And as we talked about with our Medical segment. We have seen slower volumes this year, not only in illness season, but in the primary care channel in general for the last three quarters. And so that -- one of the reasons why we went down the path with our cost optimization initiatives to better align our business and to better align it to the markets and the customers that we serve. And I would call that out as probably the one area that potentially could continue to be a headwind. But we need to -- as I mentioned, we need to see how the rest of the fourth quarter materializes, how the illness season finishes out and certainly our efforts against our cost optimization initiatives.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question please?
Operator: And the next question comes from Michael Cherny with Leerink Partners.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. This is Dan Clark [ph] on. Two on MedSurg. One for the fiscal fourth quarter, what are your expectations for the flu and respiratory season and any associated volumes there? And then secondarily, like you just talked about in response to George's question, you've seen slower volumes in the primary care channel for the past three quarters. When you talk about potential stabilization in fiscal 2026, like what do you see as the main drivers to cause that? Is it just lapping easier comps? Or is there anything else we're worth calling out?
Brian Tyler: So as we came into this fiscal year, we planned the illness season to be a "average illness season" as we look back over the years. Obviously, in Q3, got out to a very slow start. I think Britt and I have been around this business long enough to know that forecasting the illness season is probably -- is a hazardous activity. I mean when they start, how fast they accelerate, how long they endure and then how fast they fall away, it looks very, very different year-to-year. So to speculate on how that will play out in Q4, I think it's just difficult at this moment in time. We're just not far enough through that cycle. As to the Medical-Surgical business looking forward, I think we think we have terrific assets position in good markets. If you step away from the last few quarters and just think about aging demographics, think about the most convenient sites of care for patients. Think about the cost of delivering that care. Alternate sites play right into all three of those themes. And population is only aging. It's only going to need to consume more health over time. So I think we continue to believe we're in the right segments. We've got the right capabilities. We've got the right team. We've got confidence in the actions that we've taken over the last quarters to position the business against the trends that we see.
Rachel Rodriguez: And we time for one more question please.
Operator: And that question will come from Daniel Grosslight with Citi.
Daniel Grosslight: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back to the PRISM acquisition. I think it makes a whole lot of sense here. But I was really curious on timing. The acquisition comes shortly on the heels of one of your competitors closing on their retina MSO. So I was wondering if there's been any change in the oncology or retinopology markets that makes now a more opportune time to invest in this space? In another way, has the opportunity in oncology being kind of tapped and now you're hunting in other areas? And then secondly, I was curious if you could maybe go into a little bit more detail on what services or what expertise from your oncology platform you can bring to the retina space?
Brian Tyler: So certainly want to emphasize that oncology remains one of the central growth pillars for the business. But we think we've got decades of experience, terrific assets, a track record over the last four years or 5 years of growing, very consistency with the scale and the capabilities like Sarah Cannon and Ontada. We think our value proposition of those providers just continues to strengthen. And so oncology very much remains a central growth platform for us. Not for this year but into the future as well. In terms of the timing, I can understand the coincident nature of it. The fact of the matter is when you do M&A, it takes a willing buyer and a willing seller. And it takes a financial model that works for us. And we maintain very -- a lot of financial discipline through the M&A process. And so as we look at various targets, sometimes we can act on them. Sometimes, the conditions don't match. We can't agree on valuation. We don't like quality assets. So what we want to do is be thoughtful discipline, stick to our strategy, stick to our financial discipline and when we could find a transaction that aligns to our strategy and make sense, leverages our strength in specialty distribution, leverages the retina GPO we have, leverages the business performance services that we have to support that. This was just became a perfect fit at the right time, and we could agree on valuation.
Brian Tyler: Okay. Well, thank you, everybody. Really appreciate the great questions, and you're taking the time to join our call. I want to thank Justin, our operator, for facilitating the call. McKesson delivered strong results in our fiscal third quarter. We're really confident in our strategy and our execution continues to position us for sustainable growth over the long term. I'd be remiss not to thank all of our teammates and our employees for their focus, on their passion advancing our mission together. I'm proud to be part of your leadership team and excited for what the future holds for all of us. Thanks again, everybody. I hope you have a terrific evening.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's McKesson FY 2025 Third Quarter Conference Call. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.

===== 2025 Q2  (2024-11-06 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to McKesson's Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded at this time. I'd like to turn the conference over to Rachel Rodriguez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Rachel Rodriguez: Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon and welcome everyone to McKesson's second quarter fiscal 2025 earnings call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move into a question-and-answer session. Today's discussions will include forward looking statements such as forecasts about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com and to the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual report and other SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Information about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results can be found in today's earnings release and presentation slides. Presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and updated guidance. With that, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Rachel and good afternoon, to everybody. Thank you. Appreciate you joining our call. Today McKesson reported solid performance in our second quarter, generating record quarterly revenue of $93.7 billion. Adjusted operating profit increased 7% to $1.3 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 13% to $7.07. We generated strong cash flows in the quarter, allowing us to return more capital to shareholders and to make strategic investments to support the future growth of the business. We're pleased with the continued progress in our differentiated oncology and biopharma services platforms and in the strength of the pharmaceutical distribution business. Our company priorities remain the cornerstone of our enterprise strategy and a foundation for the positive impacts we're driving as a diversified healthcare services company. The second quarter results in our improved outlook for the full year led us to increase our fiscal 2025 guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted shareholder from the previous range of $31.75 to $32.55 to an updated range of $32.40 to $33.00. Before we jump into a discussion of the business, I thought it appropriate to just acknowledge the news that's probably top of mind for everyone, the 2024 Presidential and Congressional elections. Like many of you, we've been watching closely, including and evaluating the views and potential implications for healthcare policy. And I would just say at this point that consistent with our long standing, bipartisan, pragmatic approach to this, we look forward to engaging and working with the new administration and the new Congress on these important health policy issues. We feel we have a unique responsibility to leverage our resources and tools to educate and advocate for the policies that are most in line with our purpose of advancing health outcomes for all. Public policy is an element of the ever-evolving landscape in which we operate. Healthcare has been and will continue to be a dynamic market. I thought it appropriate to share a few observations about the key market trends that have been impacting our business. First, we've seen consistent and stable pharmaceutical utilization trends which support the growth of our distribution business through ClarusONE, our generic sourcing operation, we drive value to customers through competitive pricing, stable supply and on the brand side, we're continuously engaged with suppliers to ensure that we deliver the highest quality of services and are fairly compensated for those services that we provide. Continued biopharmaceutical innovation, be it GLP-1 medications, cell and gene or cancer therapies or other scientific breakthroughs, bring really exciting opportunities for our solutions in oncology and biopharma services. Within the oncology platform, patient visits have grown steadily across the US Oncology network. Patient enrollment through Sarah Cannon Research Institute is increasing consistently as well expanding availability and access to groundbreaking clinical trials. This growth enables us to empower more community-based providers and importantly to drive better patient outcomes. Within the biopharma services platform, we continue to see strong market demand for our commercialization services. Our growth is supported by the launch of new brand and specialty drugs and we're strategically expanding our services to high growth therapeutic areas. The growth of GLP-1 medications and related prior authorization services is just one example of the scale of our capabilities and how we can support biopharma in the commercialization process. Then the medical segment, we have built a strong presence across the alternate sites of care. The fundamentals of the market remain solid. We believe care will continue to shift to the alternate site spectrum. However, in the past two quarters we have seen instances of weakness in the primary care markets as demand for certain categories of products have normalized in the post Covid environment. In response to those recent trends, we've taken effective actions to drive operational efficiencies and to enhance our distribution capabilities and support of our customers. As we look across the business, we have built scaled assets that drive value for our customers, address the challenges in our healthcare system and help shape the future of care. Regardless of the external environment we're confident that our portfolio of services and solutions are highly differentiated in the market and provide unique value propositions to our customers and that they will continue to support long-term sustainable growth for the company. Let's shift gears a bit now. I thought I'd provide an update on our company priorities and strategy and then I'll turn it over to Britt to provide more details on the financial aspects of the quarter. So as always, let me start with the focus on people and culture. Our talent is at the center of everything we do and we care deeply about the development and the wellness of our team members. In October, employees across McKesson celebrated our annual Wellness Day which we call your day your way. This is a company sponsored day off. It's our way to show appreciation for the hard work and dedication of our employees, giving them an opportunity to unplug, recharge and take care of their physical and mental wellbeing. An important element of our culture is also to create an inclusive workplace where everyone can do their very best work and feel comfortable being themselves. Recently we were named one of the best places to work for disability inclusion for the ninth consecutive year, earning a top ranked score of 100. It's very satisfying to see our efforts to uphold an inclusive culture being recognized. Let's move on to our next priority driving sustainable growth in our core distribution businesses. Within the US Pharmaceutical segment, we successfully onboarded a new strategic partner in the quarter which contributed to the strong growth year-over-year. The segment's results also reflect the breadth of our distribution capabilities and our commitment to drive operational excellence. In October, we launched a dedicated business focused on supporting the commercialization of cell and gene therapies called InspiroGene by McKesson. We've been building this business around cell and gene therapy within the US Pharmaceutical segment over the last few years and the solution includes things like third party logistics, specialty pharmacy services, tailored access and support services. This launch though, marks a significant step in our efforts to address the complex challenges of bringing cell and gene therapies to market. InspiroGene will help leverage our unique capabilities across the oncology platform too, ranging from clinical trial research to care delivery in the community setting. We are committed to improving patients access to these life changing cell and gene therapies. Moving on to our two strategic pillars of oncology and biopharma services. Within the Oncology Platform we continued to grow the US Oncology Network. In September, we were excited to announce that we signed an agreement to acquire a controlling interest in Community Oncology Revitalization Enterprise Ventures, or Core Ventures. It's an internal business and an administrative service organization that was established by Florida Cancer Specialists and Research Institute, which itself is a leading physician owned community oncology practice. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including required regulatory clearance. Following the close of the transaction, McKesson will own 70% of Core Ventures and Florida Cancer Specialists will join the US Oncology Network, bringing over 530 community providers across the state of Florida. They will have access to our drug purchasing services, our clinical trial services, as well as our iKnowMed electronic health records and all the other services available through our network. In the past quarter, we also welcomed the Illinois Cancer Care and Tennessee Cancer specialist groups, adding 118 providers to the US Oncology Network. The growth of US Oncology Network brings exciting opportunities for us to accelerate our oncology strategy, expanding and strengthening our services across the platform. Upon the close of Core Ventures, we anticipate the US oncology network will grow to approximately 3,300 providers across 740 sites of care in 31 states. Now let's move to the Biopharma Services platform. We have a portfolio of technology driven solutions focused on improving access and affordability of prescription drugs. These are complex challenges faced by many patients and could directly impact their healthcare outcomes. I know most of you are familiar with our prior Authorization service which is an example of solutions targeted at improving patient access to medication. Our solutions allow providers to initiate electronic prior authorizations at the point of prescribing, which helps patients access their medications on average 13 days sooner than they otherwise would have. We also provide integrated tech driven hub services that are designed to improve access to complex specialty therapeutics. As an example, once a patient is approved for the medication, our technology services can seamlessly enroll them in a Hub program that would provide them with a range of supporting services including fulfilling insurance requirements, coordinating financial assistance and others. Our solutions integrate a streamlined electronic platform with human intervention, ensuring patients needs are supported in a timely and efficient manner. Within the affordability portfolio, our automatic coupon programs help apply copay savings at the point of dispensing. We also provide an electronic prescription service that eliminates paper prescriptions and faxes, which increases the efficiency, safety and quality of the prescription medication process. These solutions provide price transparency and empower providers to make the best prescription decisions helping biopharma address cost barriers proactively and most importantly, bringing more affordable options to patients. During the second quarter alone, our affordability programs enabled patient savings of over $2 billion in out-of-pocket costs. Moving on to our next priority of modernizing and accelerating the enterprise, we deeply believe that driving sustainable growth requires continuous improvement in how we operate the business and in how we interact with customers. In the past quarter we launched a series of companywide strategic initiatives to help us strengthen the business platform, improve operational efficiency and better serve our customers. Some examples include modernizing our cloud services, leveraging AI and automation to enhance the customer experience. The continued focus on investments in technology application led us to a collaboration between Ontada and Microsoft. Together we'll utilize Azure AI to help efficiently process more than 150 million unstructured oncology documents, significantly improving the ability of Ontada to extract valuable clinical information. I think this project is a good illustration of the value of the actions we're taking which will not only generate short term savings, but we believe further differentiate our capabilities and accelerate the growth outlook of the business. During the second quarter, we also announced an agreement to sell our Rexall and Well.ca business in Canada. This transaction will enable us to focus and prioritize investments to further expand and grow on our two strategic pillars. Meanwhile, we remain fully committed to and confident in the strength of our Canadian distribution and biopharma businesses. Let me wrap things up before handing it over to Britt. McKesson reported a solid fiscal second quarter underpinned by focused and disciplined execution across the enterprise. I'm extremely proud of what Team McKesson has achieved in advancing these important company priorities. We delivered strong growth in the pharmaceutical distribution business, made impactful investments in our strategic growth pillars, and took effective actions to modernize and accelerate the enterprise. We're confident that these actions will strengthen our business and continue to support our sustainability sustainable long-term growth. And with that I'm going to hand it to you Britt for additional insights into the Q2 financials.
Britt Vitalone: Well, thank you Brian and good afternoon. As Brian mentioned, we delivered solid second quarter results led by strong performance in our US Pharmaceutical segment. Execution of our enterprise strategy delivered solid operating performance and robust cash flow results. Adjusted operating profit grew 7% to $1.3 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $7.07 increased 13% compared to the prior year. These results exceeded our expectations and were above the long-term growth targets. Before I review our adjusted results, let me provide three updates. First, I'll share an update on our Canadian divestiture activities. In September we announced an agreement to sell our Canada based Rexall and Well.ca businesses for an adjusted purchase price of approximately $148 million. We've remeasured the net assets to fair value less the cost to sell. This resulted in a gap only charge of $643 million in the second quarter. In September, due to held for sale accounting treatment, we discontinued recording, depreciation and amortization on the assets involved in the transaction. This had a $0.04 accretive impact in the second quarter. For full year fiscal 2025, we anticipate held for sale accounting to drive approximately $0.15 of adjusted earnings accretion. McKesson Canada will continue to own and operate Rexall and Well.ca until the transaction closes, which is subject to customary closing conditions including required regulatory clearances. After the transaction close, we will remain the wholesale distribution supplier to each business. This transaction enables McKesson to further focus and prioritize investments to grow our oncology and biopharma services platforms. We have differentiated and leading distribution and biopharma platforms in Canada, delivering solutions to ensure the delivery of better health outcomes. Next, during the second quarter we began a series of companywide initiatives focused on accelerating and modernizing the enterprise, delivering operational, digital and customer centric efficiencies which will underpin our long-term growth. These efforts include the previously announced initiatives within the Medical Surgical Segment. We recorded charges of $227 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, including $147 million related to the Medical Surgical Cost Optimization program that we previously announced. We anticipate the costs related to the Medical Surgical Segment initiative to be substantially completed by the end of the first half of fiscal 2026 and we anticipate these costs will have a payback period of less than two years. Additionally, our acceleration and modernization program will be focused on enterprise technology opportunities and will be comprised of initiatives which will unlock innovation, modernize our technology operating model and infrastructure and increase customer centricity. These initiatives align with our continued evolution as a diversified healthcare services company meeting customer and market needs and driving further leadership in the areas of oncology and biopharma services. These initiatives will generate meaningful benefits and savings over the long-term. We anticipate the costs related to the Accelerated Acceleration program will be substantially complete in fiscal 2028 and will generate approximately $250 million in benefits over the next five years with an annual run rate benefit of approximately $100 million by the end of fiscal 2030. Finally, as a result of Rite Aid's emergence from bankruptcy in August of 2024, we reassessed our initial estimates made in conjunction with the previously reserved balances which included cash received as part of the bankruptcy emergence, resulting in a reversal of $203 million recorded in our U.S. pharmaceutical segment during the second quarter of fiscal 2025. The remainder of my comments will refer to our adjusted results and let me start with our second quarter results. Consolidated revenues were $93.7 billion, an increase of 21%, led by strong growth in the US pharmaceutical segment resulting from the onboarding of a new strategic partner and increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from retail national account customers, specialty products and GLP-1 medications. Adjusting for the addition of a new strategic partner, consolidated revenues increased 8% versus the prior year. Gross profit was $3.2 billion, an increase of 7% primarily a result of specialty distribution growth within the U.S. pharmaceutical segment, including our provider solutions business and higher distribution volumes resulting from a new strategic partner. Operating expenses increased 7% to $2 billion, driven by higher expenses to support growth in the U.S. pharmaceutical segment. We're pleased with the progress and discipline we're making in managing our cost structure as reflected in our operating expense to gross margin ratio, while also continuing to invest in the business to bring innovation to our products and to our partners. Operating profit was $1.3 billion, an increase of 7% year-over-year results benefited from continued growth in the US Pharmaceutical segment and our Canadian distribution business, partially offset by lower volumes in the medical surgical solutions segment. Interest expense was $72 million, an increase over the prior year resulting from higher average balances of our loan portfolio throughout the quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 21%, which was in line with our guidance, driven by the recognition of net discrete tax benefits of $44 million in the quarter. Second quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $129.3 million, a decrease of 4%, and second quarter earnings per diluted share increased 13% to $7.07, which was ahead of our previously expected guidance range. Year-over-year growth was driven by strength in the US pharmaceutical segment and a lower share count. Turning to second quarter segment results, which can be found on slides eight through 11 and starting with US pharmaceutical. Revenues were $85.7 billion, an increase of 23%. Revenue growth reflects increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from retail national account customers, specialty products and GLP-1 medications, offset by the anticipated decline of biosimilar volumes with a retail national account customer. During the quarter we successfully onboarded a new strategic partner. Excluding this revenue growth was approximately 8% in the segment. Revenues from GLP-1 medications were $10.4 billion in the quarter, an increase of approximately $3.3 billion or 47% when compared to the prior year. We anticipate continued GLP-1 medication growth year-over-year, however, with variability from quarter-to-quarter. For the quarter, operating profit increased 11% to $902 million driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to health system and specialty providers bolstered by the continued growth of our oncology platform. Moving to Prescription Technology Solutions revenues were $1.3 billion, an increase of 11% driven by increased prescription volumes in our third-party logistics and technology services businesses. Segment operating profit increased 4% to $218 million reflecting increased demand for our technology solutions including growth in our affordability product suite and higher volumes in our pharmacy automation solutions. Operating profit was also impacted by higher investments to support future growth across the business. Turning to medical surgical solutions, revenues increased 4% in the quarter to $2.9 billion driven in part by higher levels of specialty pharmaceuticals and other illness season related volumes in the primary care channel. As a reminder, each illness season is unique. The timing and severity level of each illness season can drive variability from quarter-to-quarter across several products within this segment including seasonal vaccines, illness season testing, foot traffic in primary care sites and over the counter product sales. Second quarter operating profit decreased 4% to $243 million due to lower volume levels in the primary care channel as compared to the prior year including the impact from customer and product mix. These results were in line with our expectations. Next, let me address our international results. Revenues were $3.7 billion, an increase of 7% and operating profit was $100 million an increase of 12% driven in part by higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes in the Canadian business compared to the prior year. Second quarter operating profit included $0.04 of earnings accretion resulting from the held for sale accounting related to the announced sale of our Canada based Rexall and Well.ca businesses. Wrapping up our segment review with corporate. Corporate expenses were $172 million which included pre-tax losses of $15 million or $0.09 per share related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio compared to pre-tax losses of $10 million or $0.06 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. As we previously discussed, McKesson Ventures impact on consolidated financials can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment quarter-to-quarter which may result in gains and losses, the timing and magnitude for which can vary for each investment. Let me turn to cash and capital deployment which can be found on slide 13. We ended the quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents during the quarter we had free cash flow of $1.9 billion, which included $218 million of capital expenditures for technology, data and analytics to support our growth priorities as well as investments in new and existing distribution centers. This strong cash flow performance is a reflection of our operating execution and disciplined working capital management. In the second quarter, we returned $1.6 billion of cash to shareholders which included $1.5 billion of share repurchases and $80 million in dividend payments. As a reminder, our cash position working capital metrics and the resulting cash flows can each be impacted by timing, which includes the day of the week that the quarter ends on and therefore can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Now let me discuss our fiscal 2025 outlook. As a result of our second quarter performance and our confidence in the outlook over the balance of the year, we are raising and narrowing our guidance range for fiscal 2025 adjusted earnings per diluted share to $32.40 to $33. We remain confident in our differentiated oncology and biopharma services assets and platforms and our strategy to advance McKesson as a diversified healthcare services company, as we accelerate and modernize the enterprise. In the US Pharmaceutical segment, our core distribution business continues to demonstrate its strong value proposition to our customers. We anticipate revenues will increase 16% to 19% and operating profit increased 9% to 11%. This updated segment outlook incorporates the strong second quarter performance as well as further growth in specialty distribution, including our differentiated plasma and biologics businesses and growth from retail national account customers. In July, we successfully onboarded a new Strategic Partner. This partnership is a testament to our leading distribution and sourcing capabilities and our strong customer value proposition. We anticipate the Strategic Partnership will contribute approximately $31 billion of incremental revenue in full year fiscal 2025 and this is incorporated in the full year outlook. Let me take a moment to discuss the agreement we announced and signed in September to acquire a controlling interest in Community Oncology Revitalization Enterprise Ventures or Core Ventures, an internal business and administrative services organization established by Florida Cancer Specialists and Research Institute. McKesson will purchase a controlling interest representing 70% ownership for approximately $2.49 billion in cash. We anticipate financing the transaction with a mixture of cash and debt. Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including required regulatory clearances. This transaction marks an important step as we continue to grow our oncology platform with a goal of improving and expanding patient access to quality cancer care close to home while reducing the overall cost of care for the patient. Following completion of the transaction, Core Ventures will be part of McKesson's oncology platform and financial results will be reported within McKesson's US pharmaceutical segment. We estimate this transaction to be $0.40 to $0.60 cents accretive in the first 12 months following the regulatory approval and close of the transaction. We also estimate by the end of the third year following completion of this transaction to achieve accretion of approximately $1.40 to $1.60. We have not included any financial results from this transaction in our updated fiscal 2025 outlook. This transaction will accelerate McKesson's oncology strategy by providing opportunities to enhance and expand existing offerings across our oncology platform. It will allow us to enhance quality cancer care, expand patient access and accelerate clinical development. In the prescription technology solutions segment, we anticipate revenues to increase 8% to 12%, a modest decline from the prior guidance, and we anticipate that operating profit will increase 11% to 15%. The updated revenue outlook for the segment reflects continuation of product launch delays and slower manufacturer program ramp in our third-party logistics business. For the segment, we remain confident in our ability to achieve operating profit growth at or above the long-term growth rate targets on an annual basis. As we previously communicated, we anticipate the revenue and operating profit growth will not be linear and will vary from quarter-to-quarter driven by several factors which include the timing and trajectory of new product drug launches utilization trends, the evolution of a product's program support requirements as it matures, which could result in the shift to other services or program termination product delays and supply shortages, payer requirements including utilization management and formulary requirements, the annual verification programs that we provide to our customers that occur in our fiscal fourth quarter and the size and timing of investments to support and expand our product portfolio. Moving to Medical surgical solutions, we anticipate revenues to increase 1% to 5% and operating profit to be at the low end of the initial guidance range of 6% to 8%. As market conditions have normalized following the COVID 19 period, we have noted instances of lower volumes in the primary care channel. This has led to lower sales and operating profit contributions throughout the first half of the fiscal year. As Brian mentioned, in response to the market conditions, we previously announced a series of business rationalization initiatives within the segment to drive operational efficiencies and increase cost optimization efforts. In addition to delivering improved operating performance, these actions will result in efficiencies across the segment and greater alignment with our customers and partners. We anticipate these initiatives will deliver approximately $100 million in cost savings in fiscal 2025 beginning with the third fiscal quarter we'll have a payback period of less than two years. Our updated full year outlook reflects first half results, trends that we're observing in the markets that we serve and the impact from the business rationalization initiatives that I previously announced. The medical surgical business is well positioned with an unmatched breadth of products and depth of services across alternate sites of care led by an unparalleled customer focus. We remain confident in our ability to continue delivering long-term growth as we support our customers evolving needs with a diversified portfolio of products and solutions. Finally, in the international segment, we anticipate revenues to increase 5% to 9% and operating profit to increase 16% to 20%. We're pleased with second quarter performance in our Canadian distribution business and anticipate continued growth throughout the rest of fiscal 2025. As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, we recently announced an agreement to sell our Canada based Rexall and Well.ca businesses. This transaction is subject to customary regulatory approval. We anticipate this transaction will close in our fiscal fourth quarter and based on this anticipated timing, our updated outlook assumes approximately $0.15 of earnings accretion related to the held for sale accounting. We also remain committed to exit and fully divest our European businesses. As a reminder, Norway remains the only operating country in Europe that we have not entered into an agreement to sell. Contributions related to operations in Norway are included in the fiscal 2025 outlook for the segment. We do intend to exit Norway as part of the completion of our European exit. In the corporate segment, we anticipate expenses to be in the range of $510 million to $560 million, which incorporates the impacts of $15 million of pre-tax losses related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio in the second quarter. Now moving below the line, we anticipate interest expense to be approximately $240 million to $260 million dollars, reflecting the impact from increased average balances of the company's loan portfolio and higher interest rates throughout the second quarter. We anticipate income attributable to non-controlling interest to be in the range of $180 million to $190 million dollars reflecting the success of ClarusONE’s generic sourcing operations. And we anticipate the full year effective tax rate will be in the range of approximately 17% to 19%. We also anticipate that the tax rate in the third quarter will be higher than the fourth quarter due to the timing of discrete tax items. Turning to cash flow and capital deployment, we anticipate free cash flow of approximately $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion. Our working capital metrics and resulting free cash flow will vary from quarter-to-quarter and were impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of a quarter. Our guidance assumes an increase to full year share repurchases based on our strong free cash flow and cash position. We've updated our guidance to repurchase approximately $3.2 billion of shares in fiscal 2025 from our previous guidance of $2.8 billion. As a result of this share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be in the range of approximately $127 million to $129 million. Wrapping up fiscal 2025 guidance, we anticipate revenue growth of 15% to 17% and operating profit growth of 13% to 15% compared to the prior year. For fiscal 2025, we anticipate earnings per diluted share of $32.40 to $33.00, which represents growth of 18% to 20% as compared to fiscal 2024. In closing, our second quarter results demonstrate outstanding execution against our strategic growth pillars. In addition to our strong operating performance, our acceleration and modernization initiatives are creating a more efficient organization delivering meaningful differentiation. Our fiscal 2025 outlook combines continued operating momentum across the business in the second half of the year with a disciplined capital deployment approach. We remain focused on strategically investing in long-term opportunities that will increase returns and create shareholder value. With that, let's move to our Q&A session.
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lisa Gill with JP Morgan.
Lisa Gill: Thanks very much and good afternoon. Thanks for all the detail, Britt. I just really want to go back to the key drivers of what's happening on the US Pharmaceutical side of the business. You know, we saw some changes in Part D, especially around catastrophic out of pocket cost for the senior population. We heard some of that from managed care. So, I'm just curious if you can maybe just talk to us about, you know, what specifically you're seeing that that's driving that higher growth rate. And obviously you know, Part D doesn't impact Canada, but you see strong volumes there as well. So maybe if you can just give us a bigger picture as to what we're seeing as the key drivers of what's really driving that the utilization trends right now?
Britt Vitalone: Well thank you for that question, Lisa. We've seen utilization trends over the last several quarters have been consistent and growing year-over-year. So, we've not seen a significant change in the utilization rates or trends in this quarter that we've seen in the last few. In our U.S. pharmaceutical segment. First of all, we've added a new strategic partner. We're really pleased with that. We think that that really is a reflection of all the services and capabilities that we have across the segment. We've continued to grow our specialty capabilities and certainly our sales of products to specialty providers. That's continued to grow nicely. And that was part of my remarks in terms of the second quarter. And we've continued to grow our oncology platform. You heard Brian talk about the addition of 118 providers year-to-date. That's a reflection of the value that we have across the oncology platform. And that's also adding to really to the flywheel effect of the growth that we're seeing in the segment.
Operator: And our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS.
Kevin Caliendo: Great, thanks for taking my question. A lot of volatility in RxTS and the medical segment. Has it gotten harder to model this? And obviously there's been some variability and I guess specifically on RxTS you took down the guidance for the revenues but not really for income. We understand there was cost cutting done on the medical side. Was there anything that's impacting RxTS or like why was there no real impact to the EBIT line in that business?
Britt Vitalone: Yeah, thanks for that question. So let me just start by reminding you that there are a lot of factors that drive quarter-to-quarter variability in this business. And I talked about some of those in my prepared remarks, whether that be utilization trends, timing, trajectory of new product launches, product delays and supply shortages. And I'll come back to that here in a second. We talked about payer requirements, including some of the utilization management requirements that they have that impact our prior authorization programs as an example. So, there's a lot of things that happen within this business that will create some of that quarter-to-quarter variability. We like to look at this business on an annual basis. I think when you look at it on an annual basis, we've had good consistent growth over the last several years. In terms of the revenue, we have talked over the last couple quarters about some impacts of program or product delays within our 3PL business. Not those are more delays that are either regulatory in nature or customer specific. And so that is the driver for the modest change that we made to our revenue outlook and as we talked previously, well, 3PL is about 50% of the revenue within the segment. It drives less than 5% of the AOP for the segment. So, with the change in revenue, again being modest, it didn't have a very material impact on our AOP guidance for the full year.
Operator: And our next question comes from Daniel Grosslight with Citi.
Daniel Grosslight: Hi, thanks for taking the question and congrats on another strong quarter here. I'd like to focus a little bit on the Med Surg segment. You know, guidance does still imply a pretty significant step up in adjusted operating profit. So, I was hoping you can maybe walk us through or bridge us from 2Q to 3Q to 4Q and how you expect to achieve that profitability and if there's any change in how you're thinking about the long-term prospects of this business? Thanks.
Britt Vitalone: Yeah, I'll start with maybe the mechanical piece and I'll let Brian talk about the longer-term view on the business. You know, what we've seen in this business is slower volumes in primary care in the first half of the year. In our second quarter, the business actually performed a little bit better than we had anticipated. So, I'd say there was modest improvement and we saw some stronger foot traffic towards the end of the quarter than we had anticipated kind of mid quarter. As you think about the bridge for the first half to the second half, you know, you could model about 20% growth first half over second half in terms of the year-over-year. And if you think about the initiatives that I talked about and the savings that we anticipate in the second half of the year, it's about $100 million in the second half of the year. You know, what we're not really anticipating or the business is not required to grow significantly outside of that. So, if you take the $100 million that I talked about, I think what you'll see is that our anticipation for the business outside of those initiatives is pretty flat year-over-year in the second half.
Brian Tyler: Now just say longer-term, as you think about the macro trends in healthcare, you think about the cost pressures, think about alternate site markets being low-cost settings of care or lower cost settings of care being more accessible to people that need to consume them. I think we've got a terrific footprint against those sort of secular long term trends. And we've got leading breadth of product, we've got growing private brands, we've got a lab, a leading lab program, pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceuticals. So, we think we're really well positioned against long-term trends. We're not adjusting long-term targets intra quarter. There are long-term targets for a reason. I think if you look back five years across all our segments, you see we performed well over a long-term against those targets. Not necessarily quarter-to-quarter, but over a long-term horizon, we been able to meet those commitments.
Operator: And our next question comes from Charles Rhee with TD Cowen.
Charles Rhee: Hi, can you hear me? Hello. Great, thanks for taking the question. Hey, I wanted to talk about US oncology a little bit and obviously with the acquisition of floral cancer, I think in the past you kind of noted that news oncology sees over something like 15% of all cancer patients in the community setting. Can you give us an estimate of maybe what that market share might look like following the addition of FCS? And then maybe if you could talk a little bit about sort of what the decision making that you go through when deciding either to acquire something like Florida cancer or just going into an agreement with maybe a group practice in other states? And then maybe lastly your thoughts on moving into other specialties besides oncology. Thanks.
Brian Tyler: I'll start that one. I mean first off, we've been on this journey in community based oncology for over 15 years. It was the original USAN acquisition. So, we've been after this and in this business for a very long time. And as we think about growing and expanding the market or our network, we think about first and fundamentally how do we bring accessible, low-cost, high-quality care to these communities and then how do we leverage best practices across the various network sites to continue to accelerate and enhance that quality care. When we think about growing, we grow in a couple of ways. Assess a certain geography and catchment area, assess payer dynamics, other market dynamics, demographics obviously. And then we want to get an anchor site that we can then build off of. And so, we'll in some instances recruit oncologists into our practice. In other instances, we may get a small practice and essentially merge or join it in. And sometimes we just, we enter long-term managed service agreements with these enterprises. So, we have multiple ways that we can accomplish that growth. And really, we have to make that evaluation on a market by market, case by case basis. But what we want to be as flexible and open, to be as attractive, to continue to attract doctors to our network as we can be.
Operator: And we'll move to our next question from Brian Tanquilut with Jeffries.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good afternoon, guys and congrats. Britt, as I think about biosimilars as a whole obviously that was an impact to this year with the guidance change last quarter. So, as we look down two to three years, are there any notable biosimilars that we should be thinking about? Or maybe how are you thinking about the dynamics with upcoming biosimilar releases?
Britt Vitalone: Yeah, thanks for the question. I think there's really two components to the question that you asked in terms of the revenue impact to the segment. We certainly saw the biosimilar introduction into the retail segment and we are continuing to service the innovator product. But the biosimilar that it was switched to is not part of our distribution. As we think about biosimilars, just generally speaking, we think that first of all they provide more clinical choice. And second of all, we believe that they offer better value to patients. And for a wholesale distributor like McKesson where we can provide capabilities and services for our customers using the platforms that we have in place, they'll generally offer better margins for us. In areas like oncology or other specialty provider areas where we have more assets to bring to the table, you know, we'll be able to provide more services and provide more value. Generally speaking, that'll be better margins than the branded or the specialty drug. So, we think there's still a good opportunity, particularly in part B in the part B section. And as biosimilars continue to develop and are introduced, that'll be an opportunity for McKesson to utilize its capabilities and value proposition to drive biosimilar introduction.
Operator: And our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi guys. Thanks so much for the question. Maybe just one clarification question and one sort of conceptual question. As we think about the long-term guide, thank you for talking about the EPS growth. Can you just confirm that there's the operating income growth component and contribution to that is also unchanged or if there are any differences? how you would think about that. And then secondly, maybe if you could talk about Florida cancer scenario, obviously you acquired the MSO portion of the business. Are there sort of capabilities out of that that you can as you've sort of started to look at that asset a little bit more like that you think you can sort of expand across other parts of USO and if you could talk about those, those would be helpful? Thank you.
Brian Tyler: Let me start and I'll handle the mechanical piece of this. We have not made any adjustments to our long-term target rates. In terms of the consolidated adjusted operating profit targets, it's still 6% to 8%. So, at the FCS and I'll just remind everybody we're still working through closing conditions, including customary regulatory processes. So let me not talk just maybe specifically about them, but generally how we would think about this. And this is true anytime we add a practice into the network. I mean, we have specific criteria for what is an attractive new oncologist, new practice, or new addition to the US Oncology network. And our hope in all of those cases is that we can share best practice. We can learn from each other, we can expand, find new programs, services that they may have established in their community that we can then leverage across the rest of the network. So, we always want to come into this with the idea that we're a learning organization, and we're open to finding ways that both we can improve the practice that is joining us on, but they can help improve the other USAN practices as well. And so that's very much part of every thesis that we pursue.
Operator: And our next question comes from Eric Percher with Nephron Research.
Eric Percher: Thank you. Question on inventory and cash flow. And there was some questioning of whether there was inventory build of GLP-1s in the prior quarter and then less of them in the current. It sounds like the overall growth and what we're seeing in the top line was very significant. Can you just speak to what level of visibility pharma has based on your distribution agreements and whether you have any ability to build in a quarter or whether there are fluctuations there?
Britt Vitalone: Yeah, look, we manage our working capital based on customer demand, based on market needs. And, you know, our role in this is to be as efficient as possible, but make sure the product is there. And so, the demand for GLP-1s has varied from quarter-to-quarter for a variety of reasons, and customer demand has continued to be strong. So, we've just continued to try to meet the demand as it comes in and have the appropriate level of supply and have the product at the right place at the right time. It's probably the best way that I can answer this and utilizing the efficient working capital systems and programs that we have in place.
Operator: And our next question comes from Stephanie Davis with Barclays. Ms. Davis, please make sure your mute function is turned off so we can hear you.
Stephanie Davis: Thank you. I apologize, but thank you for taking my questions. Congrats on the quarter. I was hoping we could dig a little deeper into new InspiroGene business. How can you use leverage in this platform to maybe forward some of your clinical trial solutions? And how are you thinking about this platform as it relates to investments made by Florida Cancer specialists, given your integrating them into the broader platform.
Brian Tyler: Stephanie, I missed the first part of your question. You said about what? What business are you asking about?
Stephanie Davis: InspiroGene.
Brian Tyler: Oh, InspiroGene. I'm sorry I missed that. Yeah, yeah.
Stephanie Davis: No worries. I'm traveling, so it's noisy in the background.
Brian Tyler: Yep. Okay, I've got it now. I just missed that first part. So, we're really excited about InspiroGene. We've been working on this kind of quietly internally for, for a couple of years, bringing together the capabilities we have across the organization. Some, you know, long established, like 3PL, others, some of the patient support and hub like services that we offer. As you think about these cell and gene therapies, they're going to be, you know, very expensive, very complex supply chain and logistics and very complicated patient support and information services are going to have to go around it. So, we thought we'd reach the point in the program. We're bringing these together into a single entity. To focus on these highly specialized drugs with these highly specialized manufacturers is an important thing to do. Now, we do believe over time we will continue to find capabilities across the company as these markets mature and as the needs become more known to find ways to support these cell and gene therapies even earlier in their life cycle. And clearly a large portion of the pipeline in cell and gene is oncology related. So, we think our assets in oncology, whether that's USAN, inomed, SCRI, or other, will become relevant.
Operator: And our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.
Stephen Baxter: Hi, thanks. I was hoping that you could remind us the product mix for the medical business. What percentage is source versus what percentage is McKesson brand? And then how much of the brand product you manufacture yourself versus contract manufacturer. And I guess just big picture, like how should we think about the key areas of product differentiation and customer preference to keep this becoming, to keep this business from becoming less focused on price than we might otherwise expect over time? Thanks.
Brian Tyler: So, first off, we do not own any manufacturing capability. So, we will contract for the product, essentially source the product under our own label. And we have been spending time over the past years with some intentionality of continuing to expand our private label, but also evolving our programs that can support our national brands. I mean, we want our customers to have choice. We want them, if they have a preference for the national brand product that should be available. But we want to have a strong value proposition around our private brand for those that are more focused on, you know, the value, the quality and the relative price point that that offering can bring. So, I don't believe we disclose how big our private brand for various competitive reasons are. But it's growing. It's been continuously growing and we continue to invest in the growth and expansion of that.
Operator: And our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.
George Hill: Hey, good evening, guys and thanks for taking the question. Brian or Britt. I actually have a question about Sara Cannon and I'm wondering if you guys can talk about what percent of practices or oncologists are now leveraging the Sara Cannon relationship versus, you know, call it a year ago or six months ago. And I don't know if you're willing to provide, I mean like what is the right way to think about how accretive that relationship is to the practice by increasing the number of oncologists and patients that can participate in clinical trials?
Brian Tyler: The number of USAN clinicians that are participating in clinical trials is growing and that is the result of a very intentional effort on our part post the announcement of the joint venture to think about how we created the right structures and the right models to take up that participation. That was a big thesis of the joint venture, was that tighter alignment with USAN and FCRI could increase uptake. And that has the dual benefit being good for us, but it's actually good for patient care in the communities. As we expand our number of practices, there's more convenient care, more convenient, you know, appropriate cutting-edge care that can be provided more locally to more people to make sure that they're getting patient outcomes. So that's a number that we continue to expect to expand and grow over the coming years.
Britt Vitalone: Yeah, and just maybe to put an estimate around that, we've seen approximately an increase in the number of accruals of about 20% since we started the joint venture. So, to Brian's point, we're really pleased with that.
Operator: And our next question comes from Allen Lutz with Bank of America.
Allen Lutz: Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. Brad, one for you. On ClarusONE, you mentioned some strength in the quarter, that business growing organically. Obviously, you're adding a large client there trying to think through how to think about the contracts for generics. You have some new volume for through. How should we think about the timing benefits of you buying better and how to think about the benefit on the P&L versus working capital. Thanks.
Britt Vitalone: Yeah, thanks for the question. So, you know, clearly adding a new strategic partner is going to bring some additional volume to the joint venture. But you know, we really do a lot of different things in terms of partnering with, you know, our 200 plus partners on ClarusONE, you know, there's certainly an aspect of looking at cost and that's part of what we do for our customers, provide the best cost possible. But we're also working with our member partners in terms of making sure that we have the right supply. And so, we'll do things to work with our partners to do long-term awards and other types of arrangements that are again, a little more stability in terms of products. So, you know, I think there's a number of different things. It's certainly evolved over time. It's providing really good benefits in terms of, you know, best cost to our, to our customers. But you know, increasingly looking at supply and service levels has become just as important. It's important for us to make sure that when patient shows up at pharmacy counter that the product is there. And so, we're really focused on working with our partners to make sure that we have the adequate and right supply as well.
Operator: And our next question comes from Erin Wright from Morgan Stanley.
Erin Wright: Great, thanks. A question on Med Surg quickly, just similar to last quarter, you did note that normalization and utilization across that primary care segment, but excluding the $100 million in savings in the second half, it's still subdued growth in the second half, I guess. Can you speak to a little bit more about the nature of this lower utilization? Is it just respiratory? Would there be some seasonal components to think about there and then, and then just how we think about the quarterly progression. And can you just remind us to those cost savings initiatives where you are with that in terms of the nature of those and how that flows through as well in terms of what's completed and what's to come. Thanks.
Britt Vitalone : Yeah, thanks for the, for the questions. A lot to unpack there. Let me maybe just start on in terms of the initiative. Those initiatives start in the third quarter, so they're really just underway now. We have confidence that we can generate about $100 million of savings in the back half of the year. In terms of the cadence, you know, I would say probably more towards the back half of the year, in the fourth quarter more than the third quarter. Since we're just getting underway with this, you know, we are looking at illness season that's similar to what we've seen in prior years. Each illness season is pretty unique. Last year was a little bit of a softer illness season than the prior year. So, we'll see how the severity of the illness season plays out. But we're not anticipating anything significantly More than we've seen over the last few years. So, we believe that the business is in a really good spot. As Brian talked about, we have a wide range of services and capabilities across all the alternate sites of care. We were encouraged by the back half of the second quarter being a little bit stronger than we had anticipated. But as we go to the back half of the year, we're anticipating the trends will will look very much like they did in the first half of the year.
Operator: And our last question is from Michael Cherny with Leerink Partners.
Michael Cherny: Afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe if I can just go back to RxTS and the ramp dynamics. I fully understand that this can have quarterly fluctuations. But as you think about the ramp into the ended the year as part of the reiterated guidance on the adjusted operating profit side. Where do you feel like you have the most control versus some of the market dynamics, customer dynamics that are out of your control as you think through the level of visibility you have and the build there. Obviously, a business has grown fairly robustly. The prior authorization work leading the way. But curious as you sit here today, how you risk weight some of the metrics that goes into the build for the guidance.
Brian Tyler: Thank you. So, I'd say a couple of things. I mean one is some of our visibility into the programs that we've got under contract and growth trajectories that we see from those evaluation of our sales pipeline. I would remind you that in our second half of the year, we'll go through our blizzard season. So that's a typical seasonal pickup for that business. And we expect this year to be largely in line with last year. So that's going to help drive some of that back-end growth. Britt spoke to some of the volatility in the revenue with 3PL, which really isn't going to have a material impact on the AOP. But I would say, just given the progression we've seen in the business at this point in the year and what we see in our reviews of the business, we've got confidence in the second half. Okay. Well, with that, let me thank everybody for joining the call. I appreciate the always great questions. Lisa, thank you for facilitating the call. McKesson reported good results in our fiscal second quarter, the improved fiscal 2025 guidance reflects our confidence in the strength of the underlying business reflects our commitment to our company priorities and strategy. I would be a remiss if I didn't thank the 50,000-plus employees across the company for their consistent execution for their dedication to our customers, their passion, their conviction and the urgency with which they move. Together, we're improving health care in every setting, one product, one partner, one patient at a time. Thanks, again, everybody. I know there was a lot of distracting news flow today. We appreciate you joining us. Have a terrific evening.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

===== 2025 Q1  (2024-08-07 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Please stand by. Welcome to McKesson's First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Rachel Rodriguez: Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon and welcome everyone to McKesson's first quarter fiscal 2025 earnings call. Today I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer, and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements such as forecasts about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com and to the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual and periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Information about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results, can be found in today's earnings release and presentation slides. Presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and updated guidance. With that, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Rachel, and I'll extend my good afternoon to everyone as well. Thank you for joining our call today. Earlier today, we reported first quarter company revenues of $79.3 billion, reflecting 6% growth year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 8% to $7.88 above our original expectation. As a result of our performance in the first quarter, we're raising our guidance for full year adjusted earnings per diluted share from $31.25 to $32.05 to a new range of $31.75 to $32.55. The continued business growth and strong cash flow generation allow us to deliver on our commitment to our shareholders. We're also pleased to announce that our Board of Directors approved a 15% increase to our quarterly dividend and additional share repurchase authorization up to $4 billion. This brings the total share repurchase authorization to approximately $10 billion as of July of 2024. Underpinning the financial performance is our continued execution on our company priorities. It was nearly five years ago when we centered our strategy around four company priorities and embarked on the journey of transforming into a diversified healthcare services company. We've been consistently executing against these strategies, driving enhanced value to our customers and delivering sustained financial growth across our operating segments. Course transformation and execution is a lot of hard work, takes the efforts of the full team and the path to sustainable growth is not always perfectly linear. During the first quarter, we saw solid operating performance led by our pharmaceutical distribution business in the US and Canada. Meanwhile, we experienced some headwinds in other parts of the business. In medical-surgical, growth in the primary care channels was really slower than we anticipated, resulting in a year-over-year decline for the first quarter. In Prescription Technology Solutions, adjusted operating profit was unchanged from the prior year, driven by growth in affordability solutions, offset by lower contributions due to the mix of the services within our access programs and higher expenses to support future growth. We remain committed to our long term growth targets. We have strong conviction in our strategy and confidence in the strength of our differentiated capabilities across the enterprise. Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2025, our focus remains on our company priorities and advancing our role as a diversified healthcare services company. We are investing in the business, especially where we can leverage technology to enhance product offerings and improve operational efficiencies. We've made great strides in these areas and I'll plan to share a few examples before I hand it over to Britt. Let me start though, with our focus on people and culture, we firmly believe that people are the foundation for everything we do here at McKesson as we strive to become the best place to work in healthcare. Recently, we were named one of America's Best Employers for Diversity by Forbes, recognizing our dedicated efforts to fostering inclusion, caring and belonging in the workplace. We also take a very thoughtful and strategic approach to attracting and retaining talent across the company. And this, of course includes our Board of Directors. In June, our Board of Directors welcomed Doctor Deborah Dunsire as a new independent director, serving on the Compensation and Talent Committee as well as the Finance Committee. She brings decades of experience in biopharmaceuticals and in oncology specifically. She's a highly respected healthcare industry leader. As the former CEO of multiple biopharmaceutical companies, we're grateful for the unique experience that Doctor Dunsire brings to our board as she joins us on this exciting journey of growth and innovation. Moving on to our next priority of driving sustainable core growth in our distribution business, during the first quarter, we saw solid growth in us pharmaceuticals. Segment adjusted operating profit grew 6%, driven by growth in specialty pharmaceuticals and strong results in our oncology platform which includes us oncology network Ontada provider solutions and the Sarah Cannon Research Institute joint venture, which we often refer to as SCRI the results demonstrated the diversity and breadth of our oncology assets. Also in the Pharmaceutical segment, one of the achievements I really want to highlight is the successful on-boarding of a large distribution customer this past July. This is a significant endeavor that requires close coordination across much, many, many parts of the organization. I'm deeply grateful for the dedication and the commitment of the teams at McKesson. They worked hard to ensure an efficient and smooth transition for our customer and most importantly for their patients. This is an example of the terrific execution McKesson is known for. Moving on to the International segment, we saw growth in the quarter above expectations, primarily driven by the performance of our Canadian business, which includes pharmaceutical distribution, retail pharmacies and technology enabled capabilities. We're pleased to see organic growth in the business supported by the stable trends in pharmaceutical volumes throughout the quarter. The team also identified opportunities to apply technology and artificial intelligence in areas like inventory control and supply chain management. We're still at the early stages of application, but the opportunities ahead of us are exciting. Let's turn to the Medical-Surgical segment. Market environment over the last several years, which obviously included the COVID-19 era, has been pretty dynamic and introduced volatility. But generally it was very favorable for our medical business. As market conditions continue to normalize. We've seen some general market weakness in the primary care channel, which impacted our first quarter. We're taking actions to drive operational efficiencies and increase cost optimization efforts. These efforts will enhance our core distribution capabilities while continuing to invest in efficiencies to better serve our customers, partners and patients. Despite a weaker than expected start to the year, we remain confident in our assets and unique positions in the alternate site markets and our ability to drive long term growth. Moving on to our two strategic pillars of oncology and biopharma services, we are steadily executing our strategy to grow our oncology platform and improve patients cancer care experiences. Building upon the foundational distribution services, we have built extensive capabilities spanning a patient's journey in cancer treatment. We're driving strong momentum across the oncology platform, demonstrating our differentiated value propositions and unique positions in this space. During the first quarter, we aligned all the oncology related assets and teams, including the US Oncology Network, Ontada provider solutions and scriptures, into one organization to further align our oncology platform. We view this as a a natural step as we accelerate our go to market strategies across our oncology capabilities. It will also allow us to better execute on our oncology strategy and deliver a connected and seamless customer experience across this diversified portfolio. One of the foundational assets in the oncology platform is the US Oncology Network. In the past year, the network saw significant growth, as reflected in the addition of new practices, the growth in physician numbers, and steady increases in patient visits as both patients and providers continue to recognize the value of the network. In the last fiscal year, we welcomed four practices to the US Oncology Network, expanding our geographic footprint and increasing access to lower cost oncology care, and we're pleased to see the momentum continuing. We announced earlier today we welcome the Tennessee Cancer specialist to the network, bringing the total number of providers in the network to now exceed 2600. In addition to practice management, we also support the community practices through the Sarah Cannon Research Institute Joint Venture, a fully integrated oncology research organization aimed at expanding clinical research and increasing access to clinical trials. SCRI's research network brings together more than 1300 physicians who are actively enrolling patients into clinical trials at more than 250 locations in 24 states across the United States. In the past year, practices in the US Oncology Network participated in over 200 clinical trials through scripture and earlier this year, SCRI announced a collaboration with AstraZeneca that will introduce modern solutions to accelerate clinical trial delivery timelines, reduce site burdens, and enhance patient enrollment. Let's move now to biopharma services, our second strategic growth pillar, which focuses on improving medication access, affordability and adherence through a scaled and connected network. During the quarter, adjusted operating profit in the Prescription Technology Solutions segment was unchanged year-over-year growth in our technology services products, particularly within the affordability solutions, was offset by lower contributions due to the mix of services within our access programs and higher expenses to support future growth. Leveraging our differentiated physician, pharmacy and patient networks and our transaction scale, we believe we are strategically well positioned to continue to deliver value to biopharma. In the first quarter, our affordability programs have saved patients nearly $2.2 billion in out of pocket costs. In addition, we continue to offer a variety of services and capabilities that help patients get the medicine they need to live healthier lives. Many of our products achieve this by integrating automation and technology into the existing processes. We support more than 650 biopharma brands and have a strong footprint in key therapeutic areas, including oncology, neurology, gastroenterology, endocrinology and cardiology. Our provider network is able to reach more than 50% of the specialists in each of these growing therapeutic areas. To improve the efficiency of our solutions and enhance customer experiences, we continue to explore more use cases for technology and AI. One of the more recent examples includes the implementation of a chatbot, which leverages AI to answer common user questions about the prior authorization status. We're also leveraging AI to improve internal forecasting of customer demand, allowing us to better plan for operations and staffing needs. We really think that pairing AI with humans further differentiates our capabilities and will best position our business for the future. Now, let's pull everything together. We're pleased with the continued progress in advancing our company priorities. Despite the somewhat mixed segment results in the quarter, we are confident that we have a clear and robust plan to deliver on our financial commitments. We have a strong business foundation, a well defined strategy, and a track record of execution. With dedication and excellence, our differentiated offerings will continue to drive better health outcomes for our customers and their patients. With that, I'll hand it over to Britt.
Britt Vitalone: Thank you Brian and good afternoon, as Brian mentioned, McKesson had another solid quarter with earnings per share results that exceeded our expectations, resulting in an increase to our full year guidance. These results reflect the continued growth in our US Pharmaceutical segment, including our leading oncology and specialty capabilities and our Canadian pharmaceutical distribution operations within the International segment. I'm also pleased that our Board of Directors approved two actions in July 1 a 15% increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.71 per share, marking the eighth consecutive year of dividend increases and second, an additional $4 billion of share repurchase authorization, bringing the total share repurchase authorization to approximately $10 billion as of July of 2024. These actions demonstrate the confidence that the Board and Management have in the execution of our strategic priorities as we continue to focus on capital deployment to drive value for our shareholders. My comments today refer to our adjusted results. Unless I state otherwise, I'll start with the consolidated results, followed by a review at the segment level, and conclude with an update on our outlook. Consolidated revenues were $79.3 billion, an increase of 6%, led by growth in the US pharmaceuticals segment resulting from increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from specialty products, retail, national account customers and GLP-1 medications. Gross profit was $3.1 billion, an increase of 4%, primarily a result of specialty distribution growth within the US Pharmaceutical segment, including our provider solutions business, and higher distribution volumes in our Canadian business included in the International segment. These were partially offset by lower contributions from the primary care channel. In the Medical-Surgical solutions segment, operating expenses increased 7% to $1.9 billion, principally to support growth in the US Pharmaceutical segment. Year-over-year results were also impacted by increased technology investment across the enterprise and the lapping of prior year integration costs. Result related to the script joint venture and arc savings solutions operating profit was $1.3 billion, an increase of 12% driven by $110 million of pretax gains associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments included in corporate expenses compared to pre-tax losses of $7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Year- over year results benefited from continued growth in the US Pharmaceutical segment, partially offset by lower volumes across the primary care channel. In the Medical-Surgical solutions segment, interest expense was $70 million, an increase over the prior year resulting from higher average balances of our loan portfolio throughout the quarter and a prior year gain on debt extinguishment of $9 million. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 13%, driven by the recognition of net discrete tax benefits of $125 million in the quarter. As a reminder, we had a net discrete tax benefit of $147 million in the first quarter of the prior year. As we've discussed previously, we provide annual effective tax rate guidance as the timing and amount of discrete tax items are difficult to predict. First quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 130.7 million, a decrease of 4%. Wrapping up our consolidated results, earnings per diluted share increased 8% to $7.88 ahead of our expectations, driven by pretax gains associated with McKesson Ventures Equity Investments, a lower share count and operating profit growth in the US Pharmaceutical segment. Turning to first quarter segment results, it can be found on slides seven through eleven and starting with US pharmaceutical. US Pharmaceutical segment delivered solid revenue and operating profit growth. Once again, first quarter results demonstrate the continued momentum across all customer segments and our ability to drive sustainable long term growth. Revenues were $71.7 billion, an increase of 7%. Revenue growth reflects positive utilization trends leading to increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from specialty products retail national account customers in GLP-1 medications. In the quarter, revenues for GLP-1 medications were $8.8 billion, an increase of approximately $1.8 billion, or 26% when compared to the prior year. On a sequential basis, revenues for GLP-1 medications increased $1.3 billion, or 17%. As supply constraints moderated in the quarter, we anticipate continued GLP-1 medication growth year over year, however, with variability from quarter to quarter. For the quarter, operating profit increased 6% to $815 million, driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems. Within the US Pharmaceutical segment, our comprehensive platform of leading oncology assets continues to grow and deliver value for customers and patients. Our ongoing investments in the oncology platform further differentiate our capabilities. More than 2,600 providers in the US Oncology Network continue to experience solid growth with same site visits increasing 6% in the quarter. US Oncology Network is further strengthened by a set of broad capabilities including provider solutions, GPO services data and insights through Ontada and clinical trial capabilities through our Sarah Cannon Research Institute joint venture, which includes clinical trial matching and accelerated clinical trial setup. We remain excited about our leading and differentiated oncology offerings and intend ongoing investment to sustain the growth and progress we're seeing against our strategic priorities. Moving to Prescription Technology Solutions, Prescription Technology Solutions segment delivered revenues of $1.2 billion, an operating profit of $223 million, both flat to the prior year. First quarter results reflect growth across our technology services products, including increased demand for our affordability solutions, including growth in e-voucher and e-prescribed ; revenue included 18% sequential growth in third party logistics. However, these results were lower than anticipated due to drug product launch delays, which had an approximately 7% impact on segment revenue growth in the quarter. Operating profit was impacted by lower contributions from our access solutions due to the mix of transactions and services we provide across our access program and higher expenses to support future growth across the business. We remain confident that the segment operating profit will grow at or above the long term growth target rate on an annual basis. Turning to Medical-Surgical solutions, first quarter results in the segment were below our expectations. Revenues were $2.6 billion, an increase of 1% and operating profit was $200 million, a decrease of 15%. These results were driven by higher volumes of specialty pharmaceuticals, offset by lower volumes across the primary care channel, including customer mix and product demand shifts and the lapping of prior year nutritional product strength in the extended care channel. Next, let me address our international results. Revenues were $3.7 billion, an increase of 6% and operating profit was $102 million, an increase of 13%, driven by higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes in the Canadian business compared to the prior year. Wrapping up our segment review, corporate expenses were $35 million in the quarter, which included pretax gains of $110 million, or $0.62 per share related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio compared to pretax losses of $7 million, or $0.04 share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. As we've previously discussed, McKesson Ventures impact on consolidated financials can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment quarter to quarter, which may result in gains and losses, the timing and magnitude which can vary for each investment. Let me turn to cash and capital deployment, which can be found in slide twelve. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. For the first quarter, we had negative free cash flow of $1.5 billion, which included $167 million in capital expenditures in the quarter free cash flow was impacted by the timing of tax payments and working capital investments. To support the on-boarding of new customers in the US Pharmaceutical segment, we returned $609 million of cash to shareholders, which included $527 million of share repurchases and $82 million in dividend payments. As a reminder, our cash position, working capital metrics and the resulting cash flows can each be impacted by timing, which includes the day of the week that a quarter ends on and therefore can vary from quarter to quarter. Now, let me discuss our fiscal 2025 outlook. We continue to make progress against our strategic priorities, leveraging our broad capabilities across the enterprise. As a result of our first quarter performance and confidence in the outlook over the balance of the year, we are raising our guidance range for fiscal 2025 adjusted earnings per diluted share to $31.75 to $32.55. Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2025. We remain confident in our differentiated oncology and biopharma services assets and our strategy to advance McKesson as a diversified healthcare services company. Let me start with our segments. In the first quarter, we experienced strong momentum across our US Pharmaceutical segment, including our broad oncology offerings. The breadth of our capabilities and leading portfolio of assets across oncology have led to value creation for our customers, partners and shareholders over the last five years. Our fiscal 2025 outlook for the US Pharmaceutical segment is a continuation of this momentum. Our outlook also contemplates the impact of the distribution contract with Optum that went into effect in July of 2024. Thanks to dedicated effort from our employees, we delivered a seamless onboarding experience in July. As we previously outlined, start up costs associated with this contract implementation were not material to first quarter results. However, we made investments in working capital during the quarter in advance of the contract start date. We are pleased to expand our pharmaceutical distribution relationship with Optum and this is a testament to our leading distribution and sourcing capabilities, including our strong customer value proposition. We now anticipate us pharmaceutical revenues will increase 13% to 16% when compared to prior guidance. We anticipate lower contribution from branded pharmaceuticals, which includes lower volumes for HUMIRA, and we anticipate operating profit to increase eight to 10%. In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we anticipate revenues to increase 14% to 18% and operating profit to increase eleven to 15%, a modest decline from the prior guidance. The updated outlook for the segment reflects the lower than anticipated first quarter results and the impact of product launch delays during the first quarter. Demand for our access solutions, including prior authorization volumes related to GLP-1 medications demonstrated a slower rate of growth compared to the prior year, including the mix of transactions and services across our various access programs and volatility driven in part by product delays and shortages. These results were lower than our expectations in the first quarter. As we've previously communicated, we remain confident in the long term growth rate targets on an annual basis. However, we anticipate the growth trajectory in this segment will vary from quarter to quarter, driven by several factors that include utilization trends, the timing and trajectory of new product drug launches, the evolution of a product's program support requirements as it matures, which could result in the shift to other services or a program termination, product delays and supply shortages, the annual verification programs that we provide for our customers that occur in our fiscal fourth quarter and the size and timing of investments to support and expand our product portfolio. We see solid market demand for our differentiated suite of solutions and services that help improve patients access, affordability and adherence to medications, as well as help to support biopharma manufacturers throughout the lifecycle of their products. We continue to build differentiated, technology enabled solutions that can seamlessly be used in the workflow of payers, providers and pharmacies. We remain confident that our market leading assets, depth of services and capabilities, and continued investment in innovation position us for growth in line or modestly above our long range targets. Moving to Medical-Surgical solutions, we anticipate revenues to increase three to 7% and operating profit to be at the low end of the initial guidance range of six to 8%. Over the last few years, including the period covering COVID, the Medical-Surgical environment has been dynamic and experienced volatility across the customers and products within the primary care channel and sites of care. McKesson's unparalleled breadth of services and capabilities led to strong performance as market conditions have normalized. We've noted instances of general market weakness in the primary care channel. This led to lower sales and operating profit contributions in the first quarter. Our updated full year outlook reflects the results from the first quarter and the trends we are seeing in the market, and we anticipate that these trends will continue through the second quarter. As Brian noted in his remarks in response to the market conditions, today we are announcing a series of initiatives within the Medical-Surgical solutions segment to drive operational efficiencies and increase cost optimization efforts. In addition to delivering improved operating performance, these actions will result in greater alignment across the organization while continuing to invest to better serve our customers, partners and patients. We estimate total charges between $100 million and $150 million, consisting primarily of employee severance and other employee related costs, facility and other exit related costs as well as long lived asset impairments. This restructuring program is anticipated to be substantially complete by the end of the first half of fiscal 2026. These initiatives will lead to improved margins, a streamlined infrastructure and operating leverage. We anticipate the benefits from this program will begin in the second half of this fiscal year. We are well positioned with leading assets and capabilities across all the alternate sites of care, and we remain confident in our ability to continue delivering long term growth. Finally, in the International segment, we anticipate revenues to increase four to 8% and operating profit to increase 8% to 12%. We are pleased with the first quarter performance in our Canadian business and anticipate continued growth in fiscal 2025. We also remain committed to exit Norway as part of the completion of our European exit. As a reminder, Norway remains the only operating country in Europe that we have not yet entered into an agreement to sell. Contributions related to operations in Norway are included in the fiscal 2025 outlook for the segment. In the corporate segment, we anticipate expenses to be in the range of $495 to $555 million, which incorporates the impact of $110 million of pretax gains related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio in the first quarter, as well as increased technology spend. We're pleased with the development and contributions from our enterprise technology organization, including the pace of our technology investments focused on supporting growth, innovation and efficiency. Our investments in AI will continue to focus on improving the customer experience. We continue to evaluate the enterprise technology operating model approach to effectively support the development of our strategy and needs of the organization, our customers and partners. We anticipate an increased level of investment in the technology operating model to accelerate the organization and improve business continuity, compliance and operating efficiency. Wrapping up our outlook, we anticipate interest expense to be approximately $245 to $265 million, reflecting the impact from increased average balances of the company's loan portfolio and higher interest rates throughout the first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2025. We anticipate income attributable to non-controlling interest be in the range of $175 million to international segment 185 million, reflecting the success of ClarusONE's generic sourcing operations, and we anticipate the full year effective tax rate will be in the range of approximately 17% to 19%, reflecting the positive discrete tax items recognized in the first quarter. As a reminder, the timing and amount of discrete tax items are difficult to predict and therefore we do not provide quarterly effective tax rate guidance. Turning to cash flow and capital deployment, we anticipate free cash flow of approximately $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion. Our working capital metrics and resulting free cash flow will vary from quarter to quarter, impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of quarter. Our guidance reflects plans to repurchase approximately $2.8 billion of shares in fiscal 2025. As a result of this share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be in the range of approximately 128 million to 130 million. We will continue to execute our disciplined capital allocation strategy, creating value for our shareholders. This discipline has led to a return on invested capital approaching 28%. Wrapping up fiscal 2025 guidance, we anticipate revenue growth of 13% to 15% and operating profit growth of ten to 15% as compared to the prior year, fiscal 2025. We anticipate earnings per diluted share of which represents growth of 16% to 19% as compared to fiscal 2024. Our guidance assumes that the first half of the fiscal year will deliver less contribution than previously anticipated, with the second half delivering approximately 53% of the full year earnings. In closing, our fiscal 2025 outlook incorporates continued momentum across the business. We remain confident in our leading positions and growth pillars across oncology and biopharma services platforms. We are confident the actions we are taking now will sustain the growth we have delivered over the past several years. We have a strong and stable financial foundation which positions us to execute on our capital allocation strategy and we remain positioned to deliver for our customers and our partners and to create sustainable shareholder value. With that, we can move to the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Eric Percher: Thank you. I'd like to jump right into RxTS. And Brian, can I help you -- can I ask you to help us understand the mix of services within access? I think we've talked about mix between access and 3PL, but it sounds like there was a mix of services in access that is different. And then, Britt, relative to the GLP-1 mix, is this in part the value of new scripts versus annual re-ups? Or are you seeing any manufacture pushback on price as volume expands? Or any impact from the advent of these direct manufacturer programs? Have those been factors?
Brian Tyler: Thanks, Eric. Thanks for the questions. So I think the first part of your question was relative to mix within the access portfolio. And here, I would just say these programs -- this isn't a single program offering. Each program can have nuance to it. It can be based off different sorts of transactions and interactions with the patients. We can get paid differently. It's really a manufacturer program. So they have a hand in how they want to design and what metrics they want to track, and then that translates to the transactions that we can build for. This quarter, the mix of those services shifted on us in a way that was unanticipated at the beginning of the year.
Britt Vitalone: As it relates to GLP-1s, Eric, I don't think we're seeing anything that we haven't seen over the past few quarters. I think maybe I'd just go back and talk about and just maybe reemphasize some of the things that go on in this particular segment. And I think specifically, as you think about our access and affordability programs, clearly, utilization is the foundation building block, and utilization has been stable and growing over the last several quarters. But a couple things that I would point out. Clearly, the timing and trajectory of new product drug launches is an impact. And I referenced in my opening comments that we had product delays in our 3PL business. We also have product delays that relate to our access programs. Icodec is a good example of a product that we have a program in place for, and that program has been delayed. And that has an impact on our prior authorization programs throughout the rest of the year. And if you think about product evolution, so there's also the maturity of products over time. Prior authorization programs, depending on the particular drug and the needs of the biopharma manufacturer, they will vary in terms of the length of that particular product. We had a drug, Trulicity, that was a prior authorization program for 9 years, and the manufacturer determined to shift the funds for that particular program to other programs within RxTS. Nine years is a long time for a prior authorization service. So it's not unusual that we will see either a funding shift to other programs or, in some cases, just terminate. So you have that kind of variability that goes through the segment. It's not necessarily transaction or pricing variations that are driving that variability, but it's certainly the launch timing and trajectory as well as the types of services and programs and the drugs within those particular buckets.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please?
Operator: The next will be Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Stephen Baxter: Yeah, hi, thank you. I just wanted to ask two quick ones on the U.S. Pharma segment, the profit growth there at 6%. Just hoping you could talk a little bit about the factors that are going to drive it up into the 8% to 10% guidance range for the year in a bit greater detail. And then if we were to look at the revenue revision, I guess, if you were to exclude GLP-1s in HUMIRA, is there any sense you can give us whether the decline in your revenue outlook would be the same or different? Or maybe there wouldn't be a decline at all?
Britt Vitalone: Well, maybe I'll take those in reverse order. In the case of the lower contribution from branded pharmaceuticals, specifically HUMIRA, that impact is the difference between our current guidance, the guidance that we had previously. There's no really other change to the revenue profile within the segment. As it relates to the first quarter, the performance that we had in the first quarter was in line with our expectations. I would remind you that that's also in line with the long-term growth rate guidance that we've provided previously. Again, it's being driven by a lot of the same factors that we've seen over the last several quarters, growth in specialty, growth within our oncology business. And as we think about the rest of the year, we anticipate that we'll have continued growth in those areas, continued strength in our generics program. And the 8% to 10% guide for the full year, again, is unchanged from our prior guidance. So we feel good about the position that we have, the customer set that we're serving as well as the continued growth in a key strategic area for us, which is our oncology platform.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please?
Operator: The next will be Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Lisa Gill: Thanks very much. Britt, just as a follow-up to that. When you talk about the branded HUMIRA, is it that the price is coming down because of the biosimilar? Or it's just circumventing your channel altogether? That's just really not a question, just a follow-up. And then my real question is just if you can help -- you or Brian, can help us to understand what's happening in the MedSurg business. You talked about product demand mix in primary care and shifts there. You talked about the fact that you're putting in new cost cutting, et cetera, on that. But what's really shifting and changing in that market?
Britt Vitalone: Thank you, Lisa, for the question. Let me start with your first question. This is simply a formulary change that a customer made to shift from brand to the biosimilar. And so that's the impact that's happening to the revenues is that formulary change to the biosimilar. I'll start on Medical. And as we talked about, we were coming off of a pretty dynamic period of years in the Medical segment. One of the things that we're seeing is, just give you one example is, as we've come through this COVID period, there is a significant less demand for COVID-type products, such as COVID test kits and testing in general. And what we have seen is, as we've normalized -- begun to normalize in the environment, and we've come out of this COVID period, that demand for those test kits and other types of testing related to COVID simply has not come back. It's just soft. We see good -- continued good growth within most of our segments, but there are particular product segments, such as testing and test kits and other related COVID services, that have remained soft.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please?
Operator: The next will be Michael Cherny with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
Michael Cherny: Afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe to follow-up on Lisa's relative to MedSurg. As you think about the activities you're taking to improve profitability, where, specifically, within the organization, customer area, are you focused on those activities? And I guess, with the primary care softness, can you just give us a little bit more color on what's been going well in MedSurg? And as what you think is going to keep trend accelerate trend as part of the guidance into the back half of the year?
Brian Tyler: Yes. Well, I would just remind everybody, we've got a very extensive alternate site business that plays in multiple channels: primary care, extended care, surgery center, clinic settings, et cetera. And we have on top of that a broad product offering, who, core, obviously, commodity, medical products, equipment, pharmaceuticals, specialty pharmaceutical. We have been seeing some good growth in the pharmaceutical and specialty pharmaceutical that, that creates some margin mix challenges for us. But it's a really well-scaled business, I think, outstanding customer service and reputation with customers and diversified across the channels. Now as Britt described and said quite well, we've been having patient mobility we called it at one time, demand utilization in the channel. And we've just seen it soften over the course of our first quarter. It could be lots of contributing factors to that, right? It could be impact to the economy and inflation on patients in postponing care. It could be staffing challenges in health care, which I think are quite well known. The reality for us is, is to just deal with what we see in the marketplace and make sure that we respond in the right way. So stepping back, aligning our go-to-market strategies, aligning our operations, thinking about the way we go to market with these mix of products. And as you would expect, we're taking essentially all of those actions, and that was the program that Britt referred to.
Britt Vitalone: Yes. I think maybe just to add on to that, as we think about, as Brian mentioned, as we see these trends, we want to meet the customer where they're at and meet the demands for that are changing within this marketplace or that we see changing in this marketplace. And so we have an opportunity, as we always have, to drive sustainable efficiency through our cost structure, align our organization and align our organization to the customers to drive more velocity, efficiency, as well as aligning our infrastructure or real estate portfolio, reengineer the real estate portfolio to also meet these demands. So we just want to be responsive to that. We think that these are the right actions to do that, and we are comfortable that they're going to drive significant benefits into the organization beginning in the second half of the year.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please?
Operator: The next will be Allen Lutz with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Allen Lutz: Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. Another one for Britt. I wanted to follow up on HUMIRA. It looked like gross profit at the enterprise level was a few percentage points below the Street. Can you talk about how gross profit came in relative to your internal expectations? And did the formulary change with HUMIRA impact your gross profit at all?
Britt Vitalone: Yes, thanks for that question. As I think about it, the primary driver would be the growth rate and trajectory for GLP-1s. And we talked about, in the last few quarters, that we anticipated that GLP-1s would continue to grow year-over-year, but we had seen a moderation in that growth. As I mentioned in my comments that what we saw in the first quarter is we actually saw a sequential growth in GLP-1s that was a little bit higher than we had anticipated. I think gross profit, generally, was pretty much in line with what we anticipated, but there was a little higher growth in GLP-1 distribution transactions than we had anticipated. As I mentioned, we had sequential growth quarter-to-quarter. That's the primary driver.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please?
Operator: The next will be Stephanie Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Stephanie Davis: Hey, guys, thank you very much for taking my question. I was just hoping to dig in, again, to some of the product launch delays in Prescription Tech. I get that it's based across both 3PL and access. But given it's still early in the year, what gives you confidence that this is a full year pushout? Is there any chance that it ends up flowing back in the back half of the year? Or any conservatism baked into that? Or is it a bit more predictable?
Britt Vitalone: Yes. So we have moderated our full year guidance slightly. So you see that the guidance is down about 1% at the midpoint. We have a broad portfolio of services beyond prior authorizations. We support specialty drugs through hub and reimbursement programs. We have affordability programs. So it is a very broad portfolio of services. The access programs, like prior authorization, clearly are an important part of that. But again, we have a broad set. We also have an annual verification program in our fourth fiscal quarter that has been very successful over the last few years. So as we step back and look at all of the services and programs that we have, we believe that taking our guide down at the midpoint moderately is the appropriate thing to do at this time, reflective of a slower start to the year than we had anticipated.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please?
Operator: The next will be Daniel Grosslight with Citi. Please go ahead.
Daniel Grosslight: Hi, thanks for taking the question. You guys mentioned this a couple of times now that GLP-1 growth this quarter was better than expected. And it does seem that supply constraints are abating a bit. I'm just curious, as GLP-1s become more widely available and the channel becomes more important to the manufacturers, i.e., keeping it out of the mail channel, I'm wondering if there's any opportunity in the near term for you to improve buy-side economics there and capture a little more of kind of the operating profit benefit from GLPs?
Brian Tyler: Well, we have seen really in the last several weeks, I would say, improvement in the supply situation. Obviously, as it relates to our financial relationships with the manufacturers, I mean, we always strive to get fair value for the services that we lend and support of getting these cold chain products to market and to get to the patients. And quite proud of the service and the service levels that we do provide in that regard. We are always in ongoing dialogue, a lot of it around access, availability, what we can do to support the manufacturers and these drugs, which really would have tremendous patient impact and impact on people's lives. So we are continually in discussion. Some of those discussions around the core distribution, others will be about additional services, like we provide through our Technology Solutions businesses to support them. But it's all about access and getting access to patients to get the uptake in the products.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please?
Operator: The next will be Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Lisa, please go ahead.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi, sorry. Hi guys. Thanks for the question. Yes, just a follow-up. Sorry, I was on mute. I was wondering if you could comment on sort of some of the changing mix you've talked about in the market and what impact that has on ClarusONE? And how you guys think about the contribution from ClarusONE and kind of the new services and things that it can bring as the market continues to evolve from a mix perspective with biosimilars and oncology in that?
Britt Vitalone: Thanks for the question. We're really pleased with the performance of ClarusONE now for several years. The partnership that we have with some key customers of ours, the partnership that we have with really hundreds of suppliers on the buy side, we think that ClarusONE positions us well, not only for competitive low cost for our customers, but also they focus really heavily on the availability of supply. And we think that ClarusONE will continue to partner well as we bring on new partners in our distribution business. We believe that they'll continue to partner well on the manufacturer side. And as I mentioned in my comments, part of the full year guide around non-controlling interest is reflective of strength in ClarusONE. So we're really pleased with how ClarusONE positions us across all generic products. We think that there could be opportunity to expand those services, but we're really focused on serving our customers with their generic needs from an availability of supply and a low-cost perspective.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please?
Operator: The next will be Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Please go ahead
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good afternoon, Britt, maybe just on RxTS. I'm looking at your guidance adjustment, right? And the decline in operating profit is notably lower than the revenue change. So suggesting that there's better margin in what is in the business left. So just curious what those margin dynamics are that we need to be thinking about, that impact of the delta in the guidance?
Britt Vitalone: Yes. Thanks for the question, Brian. As I've talked about before, if you look at the revenue composition of this particular segment, more than 50% of the revenue comes from our 3PL business, which is less than 10% of the operating profit contribution. So we anticipate that our other programs around access and affordability and some of our adherence solutions, which have higher margins for us, will drive a lot of that improvement over the second half of the year. Again, the 3PL business, although it has grown sequentially, we do anticipate that it will grow year-over-year. The impact that it has on our operating profit is not material.
Rachel Rodriguez: We have time for one more question, please.
Operator: Certainly, that question will come from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Erin Wright: Thanks for taking my question. So I want to switch gears a little bit to U.S. oncology and in sort of the specialty offering the news around the Tennessee Cancer Specialists today, what that adds for you and what your appetite for similar deals are going forward? And just your effort also that you talked about to consolidate the specialty offering as well and have this cohesive offering. I guess, will you be breaking out more for us in terms of the disclosure on that front as that becomes a bigger part of the growth algorithm for you?
Brian Tyler: Great, great question. I appreciate it very much. We've been very pleased with the growth of the U.S. Oncology Network over the last several years. As we mentioned, we're now in over 600 sites, 31 states, 2,600 providers. And really, it's been multiple years of steady growth. And we continue to think that the network has tremendous attraction to community-based oncology providers. We look to add to that network through either acquisition of practices through managed agreements with them, where we find a practice that has relevant scale in the geography, and we think can practice clinical oncology consistent with the quality standards we have in the USON network. So we can acquire a practice, we can attract physicians to existing practices, but I think we've consistently demonstrated over the last year is that's a key part of our growth strategy. Now when we've talked for several years about the ecosystem or the complementarity between our various oncology assets, not just the network, it's the Ontada data and insights business that we started 4 years ago. It's the joint venture with Sarah Cannon that we entered into a couple of years ago. It's the iKnowMed EMR system that we have. And I think as we've just seen these begin to mature, we saw the opportunity to more naturally bring them together under coordinated leadership to just sort of accelerate this ecosystem or this network effect across the businesses. And I'm very excited about this move. I think it brings more clarity. I think it's going to bring more speed. It's going to bring more focus. So when we think about where we invest as a company, we want to deploy capital against our strategic priorities, and expanding the network is certainly one of those and will continue to be one. Okay. Well, look, thank you, everyone, again, for joining the call. Thank you for the excellent questions. I want to thank Cynthia, our operator, for facilitating the call. Look, McKesson's reported first quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share, which exceeded our expectations. We are very focused on executing against our strategy and our company priorities, which enable us to navigate through a dynamic environment with confidence. Looking ahead, we're confident in the strength of our underlying businesses, the differentiation of our assets and where they sit in the market in terms of positioning. I cannot end this call without thanking the 51,000-plus McKesson employees for their dedication and contribution to advancing our mission. So to team McKesson, thank you very much. Okay. I hope everyone has a terrific evening. Thanks again for joining the call.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.

===== 2024 Q4  (2024-05-07 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Please stand by. Welcome to McKesson's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Rachel Rodriguez: Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon and welcome everyone to McKesson's fourth quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. Today I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer, and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward looking statements such as forecasts about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com and to the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual and periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward looking statements. Information about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results, can be found in today's earnings release and presentation slides. Presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and guidance assumptions. With that, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian Tyler: Thank you Rachel and good afternoon everyone. Thanks for joining our call this afternoon. Today we reported our fiscal fourth quarter results, marking the close to a strong fiscal 2024. I want to thank the 51,000 McKesson employees for their terrific efforts over the course of this year, as together we drove the business and achieved significant progress in advancing our mission and our strategies. In fiscal 2024, consolidated revenue grew 12% to $309 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share increased by 6% to $27.44, both exceeding the expectations we set out at the beginning of the fiscal year. We're pleased with the growth across the enterprise, supported by our differentiated portfolio of assets, our innovative solutions, and our deep commitment to quality and operational excellence. We're particularly excited about the opportunities within our strategic growth pillars of oncology and biopharma services. During the year, we saw record expansion in the US Oncology Network and strong market demand for our access, affordability and adherence solutions. I'm going to start my remarks today with a review of our company priorities and then I'm going to hand it over to Britt, who will take us through more details on the financial performance and our outlook for fiscal 2025. What you will take away from both of us today is our confidence in the strength of the underlying businesses, our commitment to continue carrying out the strategy and the momentum into the next year. The first company priority I want to touch on is our focus on people and culture. Over the past few years, we've made continued progress in transforming McKesson into a diversified healthcare services company that requires us to embrace new ideas and lead at the forefront of innovation. We're honored to be recognized as one of America's most innovative companies by Fortune. We'll continue to strengthen our innovative culture, which is essential to our growth strategy overall. Recently, we were also named as one of America's greatest workplaces for women by Newsweek and a top women employer by DiversityComm Media. I am pleased to see our company wide efforts continue to be recognized externally. I'm also really quite impressed by the commitment and leadership exhibited by so many McKesson employees and the initiatives they take on to support each other and to create an open and collaborative culture. Moving on to our two strategic pillars of oncology and biopharma services. These are both pivotal assets that unlock tremendous value and bring significant benefits to our customers and stakeholders. Over the years, we've been building out our portfolio of assets around oncology, spanning from the distribution of related therapies to practice management to oncology data insights and other value added services. We're very pleased with the meaningful expansion in our oncology assets as reflected in the growth of the US Oncology Network. We welcomed four practices to the network in the fiscal year, including Regional Cancer Care Associates, Cancer Center of Kansas, Nashville Oncology Associates and SCRI Oncology Partners. The addition of these new practices expands our geographic footprint and allows us to provide our services to a broader set of providers and importantly, to the patients they serve. As of April, the network has grown to approximately 2600 providers at 600 sites of care across 31 States. We grew the provider network through a combination of newly affiliated practices and the recruitment of new providers to existing practices. We saw organic growth in providers at more than 75% of the practices. With this extensive reach within the community oncology setting, the US Oncology Network now treats over 1.4 million patients each year. In addition to practice management, we also provide clinical trial services to these community based practices. In 2022, we expanded our clinical trial capabilities through the formation of a joint venture that now operates under the name of Sarah Cannon Research Institute or sometimes referred to as SCRI. In the past year, practices in the US Oncology Network participated in over 200 clinical trials through SCRI, enrolling more than 3100 patients in treatment studies across various disease states. And in February, SCRI announced a collaboration with AstraZeneca to enhance the delivery of oncology clinical trials. Working together, the two parties will implement modern solutions to accelerate clinical trial delivery timelines, reduce site burden, and enhance trial enrollment within our scaled provider network. In addition to oncology, our other differentiated growth priority is our biopharma services platform. Our portfolio of connected solutions provides unique value propositions to biopharma companies and helps them improve medication access, affordability, and adherence. In fiscal 2024, we saw strong growth in the prescription technology segment, delivering 23% growth in adjusted operating profit. More importantly, in the past year, our differentiated solutions helped patients save more than $8.8 billion on brand and specialty medications. We help to prevent approximately 10.7 million prescriptions from being abandoned due to affordability challenges, and we helped patients access their medicine more than 94 million times. The biopharma services platform was built through years of strategic investments. It includes targeted acquisitions that accelerated our growth strategy and internal investments that drove innovation and enhanced capabilities. One of the first assets we've acquired was RelayHealth, and it's foundational to the network and services we offer today. For those who aren't familiar with this business, it helps adjudicate prescription claims and enable the efficient delivery of prescription drugs. It's now connected to over 50,000 pharmacies and processes billions of transactions annually. The connectivity to the pharmacies provides us insights into the patient's journey and helps us develop additional solutions, programs like copay assist programs and digital coupons. We want to provide our customers not just a claims switch solution, but a robust platform that connects key stakeholders, delivers access and affordability solutions, and ultimately improves the patient's experience and outcomes. Let's move on now to our next priority of driving sustainable core growth. We have scaled and durable assets in both pharmaceutical and medical surgical distribution and we continue to deliver sustainable growth in these core businesses. In fiscal 2024, U.S. Pharmaceutical delivered solid results with 16% increases in revenue and a 7% increase in adjusted operating profit, which I'll remind you is at the high end of our long-term target for this segment. To support the business growth and the evolving needs of our customers, we continue to invest in our infrastructure, ensuring that the distribution assets are technologically equipped to maximize capacity and efficiency. And while we're still in the early stages of investing in capabilities of artificial intelligence, we've already developed tools and algorithms that apply AI in the supply chain. This is enabling us to move products more quickly and nimbly throughout our distribution centers, generating cost savings and continuing to improve our service levels. We'll continue to make these targeted and strategic investments that support the sustainable growth of our business. Our core distribution business is also complemented by a growing portfolio of services and solutions around specialty and oncology, which adds to our differentiated market position and supports our unique value proposition to our customers. And today, we're excited to talk about our strategic relationship with Optum. We started servicing a portion of Optum's business last year and we're pleased to get the opportunity to expand the scope of our services starting July of 2024. We believe this relationship is a strong testament to our differentiated capabilities and services across pharmaceutical distribution, sourcing and oncology. We look forward to the opportunity to serve and grow with all of our customers, including now Optum. As we assess investment opportunities and we allocate resources across the enterprise, we strive to ensure that our decisions align with our strategic priorities and with our mission of improving healthcare in every setting, we want to become not only a diversified healthcare services company, but also a company that enables positive changes in our communities and drives impact. In April, we launched a new initiative aimed at advancing health equity for at risk populations in underserved communities. We have a long history of working with pharmacies and providers in the community setting. Now we want to leverage our business resources and expertise to support their growth and enable better access to healthcare in many of these communities. With this project, we look to identify and address pharmacy deserts where residents face significant challenges in accessing essential pharmacy services. We chose Avondale, Ohio as our pilot activation site. We helped facilitate an expedited path to an independent pharmacy ownership in the local community, and we opened the pharmacy this past December. I had the opportunity to be there personally and experienced the joy of those who live in that community, appreciating something that most of us take for granted; a pharmacy near our house. We look forward to making a lasting difference in more communities like Avondale in the future. We also support and fund many charitable works through the McKesson Foundation. This past year marked an important milestone for the Foundation as it celebrated its 80th anniversary. During the last year alone, it funded nearly 50 organizations through its grant making program and disbursed approximately $9 million, one third of which supported direct patient care and assistance. We're also pleased to see continued increase in employee participation in these impactful initiatives. In fiscal 2024, McKesson employees put in over 44,000 volunteer hours with charities across the U.S. and Canada. I'm truly proud of what we have achieved as a team to support the communities and to live our purpose of advancing health outcomes for all. So let me pull that all together. McKesson delivered performance above our initial expectations in fiscal 2024, underpinned by continued momentum across the businesses. We finished the year with a growing portfolio of oncology and biopharma services solutions and an expanded core distribution business and a stronger culture that unites us all. As we look ahead to our fiscal 2025, we're excited about the opportunities to grow our differentiated assets and capabilities. We remain deeply committed to our strategies and priorities and we're confident in our ability to drive sustainable business growth and generate attractive shareholder return. Team McKesson is more focused and more agile as we enter this new fiscal year with strength and confidence. With that, Britt, I'll hand it over to you.
Britt Vitalone: Great. Thank you Brian and good afternoon everyone. Fiscal 2024 marks another year of strong execution and financial performance. We enter fiscal 2025 with a momentum to deliver growth and create value for our customers, partners and shareholders. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024 results. Then I'll provide an overview of our fiscal 2025 outlook. My comments today will refer to our adjusted results unless I state otherwise. We're exiting fiscal 2024 with solid performance, delivering earnings per diluted share of $6.18 in the fourth quarter and $27.44 for the full year. Our fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations and with the earnings per diluted share guidance range that we provided on our third quarter earnings call, demonstrating our ability to consistently execute against company priorities and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. For the full year, when excluding fiscal 2023, contributions from COVID-related programs and McKesson Ventures, adjusted operating profit grew 9% and adjusted EPS increased 17%. These results were above our long range targets and reflect the strength of our products, services and operating execution. Let me start with a review of the fiscal fourth quarter. Revenues increased 11% to $76.4 billion, led by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment resulting from increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from specialty products, retail national account customers and GLP one medications. Gross profit was $3.3 billion, an increase of 7%, primarily a result of specialty distribution growth within the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, including our leading plasma and biologics business. Operating expenses increased 11% to $2.1 billion, driven by higher costs to support growth across the businesses. During the quarter, we recorded a reserve for environmental matters of $0.09 per share for increased remediation cost related to McKesson's former chemical business, which we disposed of several years ago. The environmental reserve was recorded in our corporate segment. Operating profit was $1.3 billion, which was flat to the prior year, driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment offset by increased corporate expenses which included the previously outlined environmental reserve. Year-over-year results were also impacted by anticipated lower contributions from U.S. Government COVID-19 programs in both the U.S. Pharmaceutical and medical-surgical solutions segments when compared to the prior year. When adjusting for the COVID-19 programs and a modest McKesson Ventures loss in fiscal 2023, adjusted operating profit increased 4% in the quarter. Moving below the line, interest expense was $75 million, an increase of 7% driven by higher short-term borrowings of commercial paper compared to the prior year. The higher short-term borrowings resulted from lower average cash balances, in part due to the impact from the Change Healthcare outage. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.1%, which is in line with our previous guidance and driven by a discrete tax item. Fourth quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 131.6 million, a decrease of 5% year-over-year. Wrapping up our consolidated results, earnings per diluted share was $6.18, again in line with the implied earnings per diluted share that we provided on our third quarter earnings call. While this represents a decrease of 14% compared to the prior year, fourth quarter results were principally driven by a higher tax rate and lower COVID-19 program contributions in fiscal 2024, partially offset by a lower share count and growth in U.S. Pharmaceuticals segment. Turning now to our fourth quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 7 through 11 and starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Revenues were $68.8 billion, an increase of 12%, driven by increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from specialty products, retail national account customers and GLP-1 medications. As we've previously guided, GLP-1 medications continue to show growth year-over-year, but despite this increase, the rate of growth continues to moderate. In the quarter, GLP-1 revenues were $7.5 billion, an increase of approximately $1.5 billion, or 24% compared to fiscal 2023. However, GLP-1 revenues were flat on a sequential basis. For the quarter, operating profit increased 5% to $901 million, driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems and increased contributions from our generics program.
CoverMyMeds: Results in the fourth quarter reflect organic growth across our access solutions, including prior authorization services, as we extended existing partnerships with biopharma manufacturers. In addition to the strength of our access solutions, year-over-year performance was also supported by higher volumes across our affordability solutions. Operating profit decreased 3% to $212 million, driven by higher costs and investments to sustain the momentum and growth across the biopharma services platform. This included incremental infrastructure investments and cost to deliver increasing levels of ROI for our customers. Operating profit was also impacted by lower third party logistics performance in the quarter as compared to the prior year. Turning to Medical-Surgical Solutions, revenues were $2.8 billion, an increase of 6% and operating profit was $248 million, which was flat versus the prior year. Fourth quarter results reflect growth in the primary care and extended care businesses, including higher volumes of illness season testing, partially offset by lower contributions from the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. Government's COVID-19 program compared to the prior year. As a reminder, each illness season is unique depending on the onset and severity of various respiratory illnesses during that particular year. Next, let me address our International results. Revenues were $3.5 billion, an increase of 6% and operating profit was $94 million, an increase of 18%. These strong results were driven by higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes in the Canadian business compared to the prior year. Wrapping up our segment review, corporate expenses were $193 million in the quarter, an increase of 30%, driven by the previously discussed environmental reserve and higher technology, infrastructure and compliance spend. Let me now turn to cash and capital deployment, which can be found on Slide 12. We ended the quarter with $4.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. For the fiscal year, we generated $3.6 billion in free cash flow, including $687 million of capital expenditures, which included new and existing distribution centers, as well as investments in technology, data and analytics to support our growth priorities. During the quarter, several of our customers were impacted by the Change Healthcare outage, delaying billing functions and claims payments. This outage created a timing impact on McKesson's cash flows. However, the impact was less severe than we had previously indicated. We continue to focus on capital deployment to drive value for our stakeholders. In fiscal 2024, we returned $3.3 billion of cash to shareholders. We returned $3 billion through share repurchases at an average price per share of approximately $436, including $678 million of share repurchases in the fiscal fourth quarter. Additionally, we paid dividends of $314 million for the full year. When combining share repurchases with dividends paid, we returned approximately 92% of free cash flow to shareholders in fiscal 2024. Since the beginning of fiscal 2019, we have returned $16.2 billion of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Of this amount, approximately $14.5 billion has been returned through share repurchases, reducing our total average shares outstanding by nearly 36%. The strength of our balance sheet and strong credit metrics, supported by our strong operating performance and disciplined and balanced financial policy, was recognized in the quarter by the recent Moody's credit rating upgrade to A3 from BAA1 and we are now A rated by two of the three major credit rating agencies. Our strong balance sheet and consistently robust cash flow generation, along with disciplined capital allocation, continues to provide us with the financial flexibility to invest in our growth initiatives, pursue strategic opportunities and return capital to shareholders, all while maintaining a durable capital structure. Now, let me discuss our fiscal 2025 outlook. The breadth of our capabilities and leading portfolio of assets across oncology and biopharma services have led to value creation for our customers, partners and shareholders over the last five years. Our fiscal 2025 outlook is a continuation of this momentum. Let me start with our segments. We anticipate U.S. Pharmaceutical revenues to increase 16% to 19% and operating profit to increase 8% to 10%, propelled by sustainable momentum in the core distribution business and growth across our oncology platform. We continue to make investments in the core distribution network to deliver more efficiency and value for our stakeholders. The strength of our value proposition was highlighted by the recent agreement to build on our existing pharmaceutical distribution partnership with Optum. This five-year contract begins on July 1 of 2024. The fiscal 2025 segment outlook incorporates stable growing prescription utilization trends bolstered by further growth in our generic sourcing programs and specialty distribution, including our leading plasma and biologics business.
Ontada: In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment we anticipate revenues to increase 18% to 22% and operating profit to increase 12% to 16%. This outlook reflects organic growth across our solutions and services as we expand and extend partnerships with biopharma manufacturers and increase the number of brands utilizing our access, affordability and adherence programs. Throughout fiscal 2024, we continued to see increased demand for our access and affordability solutions, particularly those related to GLP-1 medications. As a reminder, McKesson's prior authorization products serve the majority of the brands for GLP-1 medications. Our products continue to generate value for our partners. Looking ahead to fiscal 2025, we anticipate that this demand will remain elevated yet lessened as the rate of increase will be slower than prior years for GLP-1 medications. The Medical-Surgical business remains well positioned to leverage the breadth and depth of its services and assets across all alternate sites of care, including growth in the primary care business and our comprehensive private label portfolio. We anticipate Medical-Surgical Solutions revenues to increase 4% to 8% and operating profit to increase 6% to 8%. Within the primary care market, we anticipate continued growth in lab solutions and specialty pharmaceuticals. Our scaled sourcing and distribution footprint has propelled expansion and growth of our private label portfolio, providing superior value for our customers while maintaining sound economics for McKesson. In fiscal 2025, we're making investments in the segment to support the recent acquisition of Compile, a healthcare data platform that captures and aggregates data to provide insights and analytics for biopharma. We believe there's an initial use case across the breadth of the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment. The Medical-Surgical Solutions segment has broad relationships with providers and extensive data sets, leading to opportunities to develop incremental value creation opportunities. Longer term, there are increased opportunities to integrate the capabilities and commercial applications across our oncology and biopharma services platforms. These investments will deliver meaningful returns to the segment and to the enterprise. In fiscal 2025 we anticipate that these investments will account for an approximate 2% operating profit headwind in the medical segment as compared to the prior years. Finally, the International segment, we anticipate revenues to increase 4% to 8% and operating profit increased 6% to 10% year-over-year. Our diversified set of assets within our Canadian business, including the scale distribution business, continues to support growth in the International segment. We continue to make investments in our Canadian technology footprint to create a more custom and integrated supply chain for specialty drugs. As a reminder, Norway remains the only operating country in Europe that we have not entered into an agreement to sell, and contributions related to operations in Norway are included in the fiscal 2025 outlook for the segment. We intend to exit Norway as part of the completion of our European exit. In the Corporate segment, we anticipate expenses to be in the range of $580 million to $640 million, which includes increased technology spend to support the growth of our businesses and infrastructure and compliance investments. We will also continue to invest in data and analytics, including the acceleration of several investments in artificial intelligence. We are leveraging AI to increase the efficiency across our operations and increase automation and productivity for our customers. Our investments in AI and other advanced technologies play an important role in improving customer service and provider productivity. We continue to build these tools across the value chain to increase speed and success rates. One example where we're implementing AI is in our oncology platform. The InnoMed [ph] EHR contains structured data that can often be sparsely entered for patient's longitudinal records. Instead, unstructured data such as uploaded documents and provider authored notes are used to capture details on patient's disease condition in response to treatment, as well as many core clinical factors. They have complete longitudinal patient records for real world research. Core variables are required to be extracted from the unstructured data into a well-organized database. Natural language process is the only scalable solution to achieve more than 100 million documents in InnoMed [ph] today and growing at the rate of 1 million documents per week. The application of AI reduces clinicians exhausted burden in finding related documents for care and reimbursement workflows, ultimately leading to practice efficiencies and better patient care. This is just one example of many where we're using AI to power insights and deliver clinical and financial value to our stakeholders. We've been pleased with our progress to date as we work to develop and implement various AI technologies, and we remain committed to increased investment to further extend our leadership positions and deliver value to our partners and stakeholders. Now, moving below the line, we anticipate interest expense to be approximately $220 million to $240 million, and income attributable to non-controlling interest to be in the range of $140 million to $160 million. We anticipate the full year effective tax rate will be in the range of approximately 18% to 20%. And as a reminder, the timing and amount of discrete tax items are difficult to predict and therefore we do not provide quarterly effective tax rate guidance. Turning now to cash flow and capital deployment, we anticipate free cash flow of approximately $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion. Our working capital metrics and result in free cash flow will vary from quarter-to-quarter and are impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of a quarter. Our guidance reflects plans to repurchase approximately $2.8 billion of shares in fiscal 2025. As a result of this share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be in the range of approximately $128 million to $130 million. The strength of our balance sheet and operating cash flows provides the financial flexibility to incrementally invest both organically and inorganically for growth as well as return capital to our shareholders. Wrapping up fiscal 2025 guidance, we anticipate revenue growth of 15% to 17% and operating profit growth of 9% to 14% as compared to the prior year. For fiscal 2025, we anticipate earnings per diluted share of $31.25 to $32.05, which represents growth of 14% to 17% as compared to fiscal 2024. We expect earnings per share will be more heavily weighted towards the second half of the fiscal year. We also anticipate the first quarter to have the lowest contribution. As a reminder, we had a lower effective tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 due to a discrete tax item. In summary, we see strength and stability in the underlying fundamentals across our businesses. Our sustained financial performance over the past several years has been bolstered by the strength of our financial position and the consistent operating execution leading to compelling value creation for our customers, partners and shareholders. We're pleased with the strong fiscal 2024 performance and the fiscal 2025 outlook reflects our continued confidence in the operating profit growth momentum across all segments of the business, supplemented by the strength of our balance sheet and strong financial position. McKesson is well positioned to deliver strong results as we successfully execute against our strategic and financial framework to drive long-term sustainable growth for all stakeholders. With that, we can move to Q&A.

And as a reminder, the timing and amount of discrete tax items are difficult to predict and therefore we do not provide quarterly effective tax rate guidance. Turning now to cash flow and capital deployment, we anticipate free cash flow of approximately $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion. Our working capital metrics and result in free cash flow will vary from quarter-to-quarter and are impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of a quarter. Our guidance reflects plans to repurchase approximately $2.8 billion of shares in fiscal 2025. As a result of this share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be in the range of approximately $128 million to $130 million.

Our sustained financial performance over the past several years has been bolstered by the strength of our financial position and the consistent operating execution leading to compelling value creation for our customers, partners and shareholders. We're pleased with the strong fiscal 2024 performance and the fiscal 2025 outlook reflects our continued confidence in the operating profit growth momentum across all segments of the business, supplemented by the strength of our balance sheet and strong financial position. McKesson is well positioned to deliver strong results as we successfully execute against our strategic and financial framework to drive long-term sustainable growth for all stakeholders. With that, we can move to Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Please go ahead.
Kevin Caliendo: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate all the color on the guidance. I just want to delve into a little bit of the pharma growth increase. How much of that is related to Optum and were there any onboarding costs associated with bringing contract like that on board? Meaning did it dilute the impact this year? And then as a quick follow-up, I noticed you didn't mention Optum as being part of the Med-Surg guidance. There is some belief that that was also a potential contract win for you or an incremental contract win for you there. Is that not true or is there just no impact this year?
Britt Vitalone: Thanks for the question, Kevin. I'll start and maybe I'll go in reverse order. Our win of the Optum contract, and we're certainly pleased to extend and expand our partnership, as Brian mentioned, is pharmaceutical related only. As we think about next year, Optum is included in our guide. As you know, we do not specifically talk about customer contract details, and so we have not provided specific contributions for Optum, and we don't intend to do that going forward. This is a recent contract win. We have not incurred any costs yet related to that transition. We do expect that there will be some costs in the transition, but not material and certainly included in our guidance.
Operator: And next will be Allen Lutz with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Allen Lutz:
RxTS:
Britt Vitalone: Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll start and certainly Brian could add to this. I think when we, we've talked about this segment in the past, there are many different things that go through this segment, one of those being our 3PL business. Our 3PL businesses we talked about in the past is slightly more than half of the revenue. And as I mentioned in my comments, the 3PL performance was lower than the prior year for various customer and contract considerations. We're certainly pleased with what we're seeing in our prior authorization business. We continue to see growth in that business. We continue to see growth in our fiscal fourth quarter as well. We did make a number of investments, as I talked about, and we also made some investments for future years to continue our growth and continue the value that we're providing to our customers. So underlying all of that, we had a very strong year. The business grew on the bottom line 23% year-over-year. So there's great momentum there prior authorization business as part of our access solutions did have growth in the first quarter, but as I mentioned, we had slower 3PL performance and we continue to make some investments into the business for future growth.
Brian Tyler: As it relates to payer and frankly employer behavior as it relates to the coverage of these drugs. I think you've got to probably bifurcate it into diabetes, which is a more mature indication. Weight loss, which is kind of emerging, keep tracking follow on conditions that it may or may not be applicable to, so I think it's in the early days of employers and payers figuring out how to handle this, and across that spectrum, it can be quite different.
Rachel Rodriguez: Question please?
Operator: And next will be Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Lisa Gill: Thanks very much. I just want to go back to the pharmaceutical operating profit for 2025. If I go back and I look at your long-term out like you talked about 5% to 7% growth, you're now talking about 8% to 10%. One, I know you don't want to talk about specific customers, but is this tied to the new customer win or is there something else that's propelling that? And then, as I think about Optum, your comments were that you started a relationship last year. You've increased the scope of services you're now doing, sourcing, distribution, oncology. Can you maybe just help us understand, one in winning that business and secondly, how we look at Optum versus maybe some of your other clients and any incremental opportunities you see with Optum going forward?
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Lisa. I appreciate the question. Look, we're obviously really excited to get the privilege and the opportunity to expand our relationship with Optum. And I think it's a testament to the differentiated services and solutions, the breadth of our diversified healthcare service offerings. Optum itself is a big, complicated entity with lots of services and lots of solutions. So we're really happy to have the opportunity. I do think it's a reflection on the investments that we've made over the past several years and the efficiency of our core operations, our commitment to continuing to make those investments, not just in efficiency, but in innovations and thinking about how we use our tools to solve different problems. This is very much today a distribution agreement. We'll be servicing home delivery, Optum Infusion, Optum Care, The Specialty Pharmacy. So it's very broad with that regard. But I do think it's a reflection of past investments that we've made, not just in distribution, but in the portfolio of capabilities that we offer.
Britt Vitalone: Lisa, maybe I'll answer your question. You know, maybe I would just start with just a little bit of a foundation building here. If you think about the U.S. pharma segment, over the last four years, the adjusted operating profit has grown at a compound annual growth rate of about 6%, so really right in the middle of the long-term targets that we provided. There are long-term targets for a reason. It's what we expect as a sustainable growth rate for the segment. We're certainly pleased with the growth that we saw in FY 2024. If you exclude the impact of COVID-related programs in FY 2023, segment grew 12%. So we certainly have a lot of momentum in that business as we enter into FY 2025. As Brian mentioned, we're certainly pleased with the opportunity to serve Optum as well. So this is a business that we've been making a lot of investments in. It's a business that we have some expertise that we're continuing to add to in terms of our sourcing capabilities, providing value back to our customers and we have a lot of momentum in this segment. And so I think the growth rate that we've outlined here for 2025 is a continuation of the momentum that we've seen now over the last several years.
Rachel Rodriguez: Question please?
Operator: And next will be Michael Cherny with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
Michael Cherny:
Ontada: As you think about the totality of the assets now, the ability to build off of that platform, how does that dovetail with your ability also to utilize your ever growing free cash flow to continue to drive inorganic growth on top of organic, and within that portfolio of, again broad based oncology assets, what are the best areas you have to continue to expand beyond where you already are.
Brian Tyler: Yes. Thank you, Michael. I appreciate that. We talked about many times our cap, our capital allocation strategy, and our first priority in that strategy is to invest, to grow the business, either through internal development and investments in innovation or inorganic opportunities. Certainly, when we look at inorganic opportunities or M&A, we like that to be very, very tightly aligned to our articulated strategy, with the associated proper financial returns of course. And so oncology is one of those growth areas and one of those growth priorities. And being a pretty significant player in the oncology space in general, and leading player in the community oncology space, we're very familiar with a lot of what I would call emerging tools, technologies and companies out there and anywhere that we can find an asset that's aligned to our strategy in community oncology that we think is additive to either the footprint that we have in U.S. oncology or our leading EMR, or our ads capability to our data insight business or accelerates clinical trials would be very much a sweet spot for us. And Britt actually referenced in his comments some internal stuff we're doing around AI, and we have made some small acquisitions in the past that bring us capabilities in this area that are helping us improve our interface with patients, our efficiency in serving those patients, and improving the practice quality or the lifestyle basically, of our oncologists. That practice is part of U.S. oncology, and we think that part of the overall formula that's been really supporting and enabling, well, quite frankly, the record growth that we had last year.
Rachel Rodriguez: Question please?
Operator: And next will be Charles Rhyee with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Charles Rhyee: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to circle back to RxTS, obviously looking at a really positive outlook, but thinking about the preliminary fiscal 2025 guide you kind of gave for this segment last quarter, the final guide actually is a little bit better here. Any sort of comments on what is driving sort of the increased optimism here? Is it solely just as we're thinking about maybe GLP-1s or maybe can you talk about sort of any kind of gains at RelayHealth as it relates to the Change Healthcare outage? Any comments there would be helpful. Thanks.
Britt Vitalone: Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll start. So the AOP growth guide that we provided you for FY 2025 is really right in the range of what we've seen for growth over the last four years, maybe just slightly below. We had 16% compound annual growth rate in this business on operating profit since FY 2020. And so the growth rate that we've provided you this year is really kind of right in line with that. And we intend to continue to make investments in this business as we go forward to develop additional solutions and capabilities for our customers. So we expect that our technology, solutions and services will continue to grow as they have over the last few years. The value that we're providing for our partners is continuing to resonate and we see stable prescription growth that's really underpinning a lot of the programs and solutions that we have. And the growth rate that we expect for next year is really in line with what we've been able to deliver over the last several and we'll continue to. As Brian talked about, we'll use our free cash flow to invest in our growth opportunities as we go forward.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question please?
Operator: And next will be Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Eric Percher: Thank you. A question relative to competitive intensity and specifically contract movement we've seen, I think with Optum there was a real concern that the contract could even be outsourced or elements of specialty could be outsourced and yet here it comes to you. And we've also seen CVS outsource and scale to you. So my question would be, do you believe that you've developed a scale advantage in mail and specialty that is unique relative to other distributors, and/or how important is the specialty footprint in driving the value that has led to these significant gains?
Brian Tyler: Thanks, Eric. Well, look, I'm not going to comment much on the competitive set, but I can say, you know, we have made pretty significant investments in the business and to modernize our distribution infrastructure. Think about cold chain and how you handle cold chain efficiently, have a highly compliant distribution network. We certainly have scale, and in this business, I've been in this business 28 years, and scale does tend to help. But I really come back to the fact that we've made the investments in core distribution excellence. We clearly understand this piece of the market quite well, and that we think of ourselves as a solution oriented, value-added kind of partner and try to paint a broad picture of not just what we could do if we had a relationship, but how we could grow that relationship through time using an array of the capabilities represented within McKesson.
Britt Vitalone: Eric, I would just add to that if you think about the strategy that we've executed on over the last several years, we've been very disciplined and focused and really growing our capabilities in oncology and pharma services, including the investments that Brian spoke of in terms of our distribution network. So the breadth of capabilities that we have today is more significant than it was a few years ago. And, the value that we're able to provide now through the investments that we've made through some of the other acquisitions that we've made in, like oncology as an example, we believe that that value is what is attractive and the breadth of capabilities that we have as well.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question please?
Operator: And next will be Stephanie Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Stephanie Davis: Hey, guys, thank you for taking my question and congrats on a really good guidance. I was hoping to get a little bit more color about the nature of the biopharma investments you're making in the prescription transaction business. Just kind of nature of it whether these are more of a recurring expense like headcount compared to more near-term pockets of spend like platform development and anything you can give us on that?
Brian Tyler: Yes, so I'll start and if Britt wants to add anything, he can. I mean, we have a pretty differentiated set of assets in this business. Multiple scaled networks is what we call them, which includes connectivity into provider workflow. And we very much fundamentally think part of our job is to continue to innovate off of those, to both enhance the value and the return our products provide to biopharma and to continue to solve new problems for them. So we have historically always invested in this business, and when we see an opportunity ahead of us, we are not afraid to increase that investment to run at that, because we think these differentiated assets allow us to solve problems in unique ways. Most of this investment has been in technology, and that's probably about all I would say.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question please?
Operator: And next will be Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi guys, thanks so much for the question and congrats on a nice guide. I was intrigued by your comments about the Med-Surg segment and sort of how you're thinking about data and the use of assets with the new acquisition you just made. It seems like a little bit of a shift into more sort of additional value-added services in that segment. Could you give a little bit more color on that and sort of how you see that evolving over the next couple of years?
Brian Tyler: Sure. I mean, in many ways we thought of Compile as a foundational data investment for us, and we liked the business by itself. But we also thought given some of the other data sets, transaction sets that reside in the company, we could augment and add and accelerate that. We chose a first use case in the medical business where we have, extensive, hundreds of thousands of relationships with providers and data that complement their already strong provider data service offering. So we think we can both augment that and unlock unique value because of the footprint and reach in Med-Surg and so we're making an investment into that thesis.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question please?
Operator: And next will be Daniel Grosslight with Citi. Please go ahead.
Daniel Grosslight: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to a question that Charles asked on RxTS, but really on the top line you're seeing a material acceleration in growth next year, while as you mentioned, the adjusted operating income is kind of in line with where you've been historically. So it does imply a bit of a degradation in margin. So I was hoping you could find a finer point on the growth acceleration on the top line and margin compression you're seeing, is that mix shift to lower margin businesses? Is that the increased investments you're making? Any color there would be great. Thanks.
Brian Tyler: Thanks for that question. I can answer that. The growth that we're seeing next year on the top line is more accelerated growth in our 3PL business. As we've talked about before, the 3PL business generally represents a little more than half of the revenue in the segment, but less than 10% of the adjusted operating profit. So as we expect to win some additional business next year and see some of our customers continue to grow, that revenue will be faster rate than we've seen in prior years. And given the mix that that represents in this segment is, driving faster top line again at a lower margin rate on the bottom line from that particular business, 3PL business. So the underlying technology businesses are continuing to grow in a consistent manner and we're really pleased with the growth that we're seeing there. What you're seeing is a mix impact in FY 2025 from the 3PL business.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question please?
Operator: And next will be Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Erin Wright: Great, thanks. I wanted to get a little bit of color on what you're seeing and what's embedded in your guidance in terms of the pricing environment on the U.S. pharma business and what assumptions you're making in terms of generic pricing trends and environment that you're seeing as well as kind of on the branded side? I know that's less of a swing factor for you, but how is that playing out relative to your expectations here? Thanks.
Brian Tyler: Sure. Happy to answer that question. As we think about the pricing environment for branded products, it is going to be, our anticipation is to be very consistent with what we've seen in the past several years, so stable and competitive branded price environment. In the generic space, again, we look to drive value for our customers through our sourcing operations, looking to drive the lowest cost at the highest availability supply. And we believe that the, in our outlook for FY 2025, we expect to see a competitive and stable environment in the generic space as well. So we don't see a lot of changes in the environment for both branded and generics pricing in our outlook versus FY 2024. And we anticipate that we can continue to drive good value in the generic space for our customers.
Rachel Rodriguez: I think we have time for probably one more question.
Operator: Certainly. That question will come from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Stephen Baxter: Hey, thanks for the question. A question of guidance, I wanted to ask one on the quarter, just on the pharma revenue growth rate. I was wondering if you could help us think about any impact you might have seen from insulin list price changes in the quarter. It sounds like that was probably a headwind to your revenue growth rate. And any contribution from commercial COVID vaccines in the quarter that we should be mindful of? Thanks.
Britt Vitalone: Yes, nothing really specific to call out there, Stephen. And as it relates to COVID vaccines, as I mentioned, we are lapping the COVID programs that we had last year and from the commercial vaccines perspective, lower contribution than we saw in the third quarter, really a non-material amount of contribution to our fourth quarter results.
Brian Tyler: Hey well, thanks again everyone for joining our call this evening. We appreciate your ongoing interest and support of McKesson. I want to thank you, operator for facilitating the call. McKesson reported solid performance in fiscal 2024. I'm really pleased with the momentum across the segments and the continued commitment to our company's priorities. Looking ahead to 2025, I remain confident in our ability to consistently execute against our strategies which will support and sustain growth in the long term. We're excited about the opportunity to grow with our customers, to drive innovation through our differentiated portfolio of services and solutions. But most importantly, it's in service of our mission to advance, improve healthcare in every setting. I appreciate everyone’s time. I hope you have a terrific evening.
Operator: Thank you for joining today’s conference call. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-02-07 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to McKesson’s Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Rachel Rodriguez: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome everyone to McKesson’s third quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. Today, I’m joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today’s discussion will include forward-looking statements such as forecast about McKesson’s operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today’s earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com and to the Risk Factors section of our most current recent annual and periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Information about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results, can be found in today’s earnings release and presentation slides. The presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and updated guidance. With that, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Rachel, and good afternoon to everybody. Thanks for joining our call. McKesson reported a solid fiscal third quarter highlighting the continued momentum across the business. We delivered total revenues of $80.9 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $7.74 both of which grew by double-digits when compared to the prior year. As a result of the recent performance and our latest outlook we are raising and narrowing our guidance range for fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share from $26.80 to $27.40 to an updated range of $27.25 to $27.65. This solid financial performance is driven by that focus execution against our company priorities as a diversified healthcare services company we are uniquely positioned to improve healthcare in every setting. This includes the areas of oncology and biopharma services. We continue to make significant progress in advancing our strategy and priorities, and I'm pleased to share some of the updates with you today. Let me start where I always like to start, and that's with our focus on people and culture. I start here because it's foundational to everything we do at McKesson. In January, our board of directors welcomed Kevin Ozan as a new independent director. As the former Chief Financial Officer of McDonald's Corporation, Mr. Ozan has over two decades of experience in both strategy and finance, and will contribute a valuable perspective to our boardroom. We look forward to his leadership as we work together to deliver on our growth initiatives. Driving the growth of our company requires a talented and diverse leadership team, and equally important, a diverse workforce where each individual is empowered to bring their own opinions, their own ideas, and perspectives. Our commitment to best talent and inclusion is reflected in every aspect of our operations. It's how we build a support network for our employees and how we each live these values through everyday interactions. And I'm pleased to see our efforts being recognized. For the 11th consecutive year, McKesson was named as a military-friendly employer. We were also recognized by Newsweek as one of America's greatest workplaces for diversity, and a Quality 100 award winner by the Human Rights Campaign. I'm proud of what we've achieved as a team and I'm truly grateful to the McKesson employees for upholding our culture, values, and delivering for all of our stakeholders, our patients, our customers, our partners, our shareholders, and importantly, each other. Moving on to our next priority of driving sustainable core growth, in the fiscal third quarter, we saw good performance in our distribution businesses. In U.S. pharmaceutical, adjusted operating profit grew 6%, reflecting broad-based momentum within the segment. We continue to enhance our scaled distribution network improving efficiency through investments in automation and technology. Over the past year, we opened two new distribution centers in the U.S. that are equipped with innovative technology and employee-friendly design. These enhancements will enable our facilities to pick, pack, and ship medications to customers faster, while simultaneously helping to optimize employee productivity levels by reducing redundant tasks. The investments in our foundational distribution assets continue to support the growth of our business and the success of our customers. During the third quarter, we saw solid volume increases across customer channels, which includes distribution to retail national accounts customers. At the consolidated level, prescription volume growth remains stable. Certain product categories, including specialty pharmaceuticals and GLP-1 medications, continue to grow at a faster pace and contribute as a tailwind to our revenue growth. As a reminder, we anticipate the growth from GLP-1 medications to slow in our fiscal fourth quarter, reflecting the inflection in volumes for these medications in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. In the medical-surgical segment, primary care visits showed modest improvement on a sequential basis after we observed general market moderations last quarter. The improvement was partially driven by overall increase in primary care visits. However, when compared to the prior year, patient visit volumes in the medical segment remain a headwind to this quarter's performance. In the international segment, our Canadian business continues to perform well. It has a valuable portfolio of assets, including pharmaceutical distribution, retail pharmacies, digital offerings. We're committed to strengthening and grow the business there. And as a part of that commitment, we're executing on a multi-year initiative that will modernize the distribution centers across Canada and deliver significant value to our employees and customers. Let me now continue on to talk about our oncology and biopharma platforms. We continue to build on the foundation of our core distribution capabilities, but we have strategically assembled a differentiated set of assets in oncology and biopharma services. Within the oncology business, the U.S. Oncology Network expanded its footprint by entering the state of Tennessee. Over the past quarter, we welcomed two new practices, Nashville Oncology Associates and SCRI Oncology Partners to the network. Through the combination of onboarding new practices and organic growth, the U.S. Oncology Network has grown its provider base to over 2,500, spreading across nearly 600 sites in 30 states. The expansion of the network strengthened our unique market position in community-based oncology practices and demonstrates our strong value proposition to providers. Through the U.S. Oncology Network, we provide a range of comprehensive solutions to ease the administrative and operational burden and to help enable the success of these community practices. In the past quarter, we started integrating new artificial intelligence capabilities into the network, assisting providers with revenue cycle management and evaluating clinical solutions. With the help of AI and machine learning technologies, practices have been able to navigate complex insurance coverage and reimbursement processes more efficiently, allowing providers to spend more time focused on their patients. Within the biopharma services business, we continue to see strong market demand for our differentiated solutions that help improve access, affordability, and adherence to medications. In the third quarter of this fiscal third quarter, the prescription technology solution segment delivered strong performance, primarily driven by the growth in access solutions, including prior authorization solutions for branded pharmaceuticals such as GLP-1 medications. Today, we provide prior authorization services for the vast majority of the GLP-1 medications in the market. Our integrated technology streamlines the prior authorization process and helps overcome medication access challenges that patients are facing. The main customers we serve are biopharma companies, and through our scaled network connection, we can electronically process requests both at the pharmacy counter and the provider's offices. The prior authorization solution is an example of the power of our capabilities and is part of a broader portfolio of patient support services we provide. We believe our solutions are highly differentiated and provide value to all stakeholders through a patient's journey. We're connected to over 50,000 pharmacies and approximately 900,000 providers. The scale of our network provides a strong foundation that enables us to reach key stakeholders effectively and seamlessly. The integrated solutions we offer can often be accessed through a single digital entry point. For our biopharma customers, the integration helps streamline workflows and increase transparency into how programs work together. In the past quarter, our team has been working diligently to prepare for what we call the blizzard season. For the prescription technology solution segment, our fiscal fourth quarter is usually the busiest time of year due to customer annual verification activities. The annual reset of insurance policies typically drives a large influx of seasonal volumes for many of our programs. Each year, our teams come together to tackle the challenge of these significant volume increases. I'm pleased to report that we're on track to deliver another successful blizzard season that is in line with our expectations. Our products and solutions in both oncology and biopharma services provide significant value to our customers as reflected in the continued growth of these businesses. We're excited about the market opportunities in both areas and we're confident in the scale and depth of our assets and expertise. We will continue to invest and innovate to support the evolving needs of our customers and their patients. So let me pull it all together. McKesson reported another solid quarter in fiscal 2024 that allowed us to raise and narrow our full year guidance for adjusted earnings for diluted share. We're committed to our shareholders to delivering long-term sustainable growth and this quarter's results reflect the continued progress in delivering on our commitment. Healthcare is an ever-evolving market, but thanks to the hard work and dedication of our employees, we never stopped finding new ways to drive positive impacts on our customers and their patients. I want to thank the over 50,000 McKesson employees who are working so tirelessly to advance our mission. And with that, I'll hand it over to Britt for some additional insight and comments.
Britt Vitalone: Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon. We're pleased with our fiscal third quarter 2024 results, which reflect another quarter of solid momentum with growth across our North American businesses. Our results exceeded expectations, demonstrating our ability to consistently execute against company priorities and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. Before I turn to our consolidated results, I want to highlight one item that impacted our third quarter GAAP only results. We recorded an additional pre-tax GAAP provision for bad debts of $515 million or $381 million after tax within the U.S. pharmaceutical segment. This provision is for uncollected trade accounts receivable from sales to Rite Aid in October of 2023 prior to its bankruptcy petition filing. We continue to provide distribution services to Rite Aid through an interim distribution agreement, providing the same efficiency and operational excellence as we have for over 20 years. We're closely monitoring developments. Rite Aid's bankruptcy will not have a material impact on our fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share results. The remainder of my comments will refer to our fiscal 2024 adjusted results. Let me start with a review of the fiscal third quarter. McKesson delivered solid growth in the third quarter, led by sustained strong performance in the U.S. pharmaceutical and prescription technology solution segments. This year-over-year growth underscores operating execution across our diversified and differentiated portfolio, including investments in oncology and biopharma services. As a result of the third quarter operating performance and our confidence in the business, we're increasing and narrowing our full year outlook for fiscal 2024, adjusted earnings per diluted share to a new range of $27.25 to $27.65. Let me move to our consolidated results. Revenues increased 15% to $80.9 billion, led by continued strong utilization trends, growth in the U.S. pharmaceutical segment, including higher volumes from specialty products, retail national account customers, and GLP-1 medications, partially offset by lower revenues in the international segment, resulting from fiscal 2023 divestitures within McKesson's European business. Excluding the impact of our European business operations, including completed divestitures, revenues increased 16%. Gross profit was $3.1 billion for the quarter and increased with 3%. When excluding the impact of our European business operations including completed divestitures and the impact from U.S. government COVID-19 programs in fiscal 2023, gross profit increased 10%. Operating expenses increased 4% in the quarter due to higher costs to support growth in the U.S. pharmaceutical and prescription technology solution segments. When excluding the impact of our European business operations including the completed divestitures, operating expenses increased 6% year-over-year. Third quarter operating profit decreased 9% to $1.3 billion. Fiscal 2023 results included a pre-tax benefit of $126 million related to the early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement, or TRA, with Change Healthcare. Year-over-year results were also impacted by anticipated lower contributions from U.S. government COVID-19 programs, which were mitigated by contributions from commercial COVID-19 distribution and a non-recurring $30 million charge in our U.S. pharmaceutical segment. These items were partially offset by growth in the U.S. pharmaceutical and prescription technology solution segments. When adjusting for these items, including $126 million or $0.65 benefit from the early termination of the TRA in fiscal 2023 and gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments in fiscal 2023 and 2024, operating profit increased 7% in the quarter. Moving below the line, interest expense was $58 million, a decrease of 16% year-over-year driven by effective management of our loan portfolio. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 10.6%, resulting from the recognition of discrete tax benefit in the quarter. As a reminder, our effective tax rate can vary quarter-to-quarter, driven by our mix of income and the timing of discrete tax items. Third quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 133.3 million, a decrease of 5% year-over-year. Consolidated third quarter earnings per diluted share was $7.74, which represents an increase of 12% over the prior year. This increase includes the impacts of approximately $0.63 related to the U.S. government COVID-19 programs and the $0.65 benefit from the termination of the TRA in fiscal 2023, an increased commercial COVID-19 vaccine distribution and a non-recurring charge in our U.S. pharmaceutical segment in fiscal 2024. Turning to our third quarter segment results, which can be found on slides seven through 11, and starting with the U.S. pharmaceutical. During the quarter, we experienced volume increases across all product categories and customer channels. Specialty Pharmaceuticals and GLP-1 medications continue to grow at a faster pace compared to the prior year. Third quarter revenues were $73 billion, an increase of 18% year-over-year, driven by increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from specialty products, retail national account customers, and GLP-1 medications. In the quarter, GLP-1 revenues were $7.5 billion, an increase of approximately $2.8 billion or 60% compared to fiscal 2023. During the quarter, we also noted increased contributions from commercial COVID-19 vaccine distribution. In our fiscal third quarter, commercial COVID-19 vaccine distribution peaked in October, then declined significantly in November and December. We do not anticipate material contributions from commercial COVID-19 vaccine distribution in our fiscal fourth quarter. For the third quarter, operating profit increased 6% to $828 million, driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems. Adjusting for the impact of the U.S. government COVID-19 vaccine distribution in fiscal 2023, commercial COVID-19 distribution in fiscal 2024, and the $30 million non-recurring charge in the U.S. pharmaceutical segment delivered operating profit growth of 8% year-over-year. In our prescription technology solution segment, the growth of GLP-1 medications and new brand launches led to increased demand for our access solutions such as prior authorization services. For the third quarter, revenues increased 7% year-over-year to $1.2 billion. And operating profit increased 25% to $193 million. Third quarter results reflect increased prescription transaction volumes, which drove higher demand for our access solutions, principally prior authorization services and growth in our third party logistics business. In addition to the strength of prior authorization services, year-over-year growth was also supported by increased sales to new customers and programs across our access and affordability solutions. Turning to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $3 billion in the quarter, an increase of 2%, primarily driven by growth in the primary care and extended care businesses, partially offset by anticipated lower contributions in the kitting, storage, and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program compared to the prior year. In the third quarter, primary care patient visits moderately increased on a sequential basis. Demand for commercialized COVID-19 vaccine distribution across the alternate sites of care that we serve was also modestly higher compared to prior expectations. The overall illnesses and dynamics, including vaccinations and testing, continued to be an operating profit headwind in the quarter when compared to the prior year. As a reminder, each illness season is unique, depending on the onset and severity of various respiratory illnesses during that particular year. Operating profit was $282 million, a decrease of 16%, driven by anticipated lower contributions from the kitting, storage, and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program and a softer illness season as compared to fiscal 2023. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 related items from the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the segment delivered operating profit growth of 7%, driven by growth in the primary care and extended care businesses. Next, let me address our international results. Revenues in the third quarter were $3.6 billion, a decrease of 18% year-over-year, driven by divestitures within McKesson's European business, partially offset by higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes in Canada. Operating profit was $105 million, a decrease of 27%, driven by divestitures within McKesson's European business. Wrapping up our segment review, corporate expenses were $147 million in the quarter, which included losses of $8 million, or $0.05 per share, related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio. McKesson Ventures' impact on consolidated financials can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment quarter-to-quarter. As a result, McKesson's investments may result in gains or losses, the timing and magnitude of which can vary for each investment. We remain pleased with the insights and the results that we're obtaining through this portfolio. Excluding the benefit from the early termination of the tax receivable agreement in fiscal 2023, and gains and losses within our McKesson Ventures portfolio in fiscal 2023 and 2024, corporate expenses in the third quarter decreased 5% year-over-year. Turning now to cash flows and capital deployment, which can be found on slide 12. We ended the quarter with $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We delivered free cash flow of $100 billion in the third quarter, and $2.9 billion for the trailing 12-months. Third quarter free cash flow was impacted by the Right-Aid bankruptcy in October, and its associated $725 million provision for bad debts. As a reminder, our cash position, working capital metrics, and resulting cash flows can each be impacted by timing, which includes the day of the week that a quarter ends on, and therefore can vary from quarter-to-quarter. During the first nine months of the fiscal year, we made capital expenditure investments of $418 million, which included new and existing distribution centers, as well as investments in technology, data, and analytics to support our growth priorities. Year-to-date, we returned $2.6 billion of cash to shareholders, which included $2.3 billion of share repurchases, and $232 million in dividend payments. Now let me turn to our updated fiscal 2024 outlook. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis. The following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full list of our assumptions can be found on slides 13 through 17 in our supplemental slide presentation. Let me start with the fiscal 2024 outlook for our segments. For the full year, we now anticipate U.S. pharmaceutical revenues to increase 16% to 18% and operating profit to increase 6% to 8% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution for the U.S. government in fiscal 2023, we anticipate operating profit to increase 11% to 14%. The impact of elevated commercial COVID-19 distribution in the third quarter, net of the $30 million non-recurring charge, also in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, accounts for approximately 2% of segment growth. The updated segment revenue outlook incorporates the strong third quarter performance and continued growth in specialty distribution, supported by stable utilization trends. Revenue growth assumes the GLP-1 medication volumes will continue to be robust, although the rate of growth will moderate in our fiscal fourth quarter. These medications are lower margin and represent a headwind to year-over-year operating profit growth. Our full year operating profit growth also reflects our leading generics program, which continues to deliver on the dual mandate of lower cost and product availability. We continue to be pleased with the strength of our scaled and broad oncology platform. This quarter, as Brian mentioned, we expanded into Tennessee with the addition of two practices. With these additions and organic growth, U.S. oncology is now over 2,500 providers. In the Prescription Technology Solution segment, we anticipate revenue growth of 9% to 13%, and we've increased our operating profit growth outlook to 24% to 28%, reflecting strong third quarter performance, continued organic growth, and higher transaction volumes across our access and affordability solutions. The quarter-to-quarter variability in this segment is driven by prescription and transaction volumes. The timing, pace, and trajectory of new product drug launches, the timing and size of investments to support and expand our product portfolio, and the annual verification programs that we provide for our customers that occur in our fiscal fourth quarter. Our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment continues to be a leader across all the alternate sites of care. We anticipate revenues to be approximately flat to 4% growth, and operating profit to decrease 11% to 15%. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 related items from fiscal 2023 results, we anticipate operating profit to increase 6% to 8% year-over-year. Our updated outlook incorporates the third quarter results that I discussed earlier, which reflect a modest improvement in sequential primary care traffic. Finally, in the International segment, we anticipate revenues to decline by 29% to 33%, and operating profit to decline by 21% to 26%, reflecting divestitures within McKesson's European business that closed during fiscal 2023. In the corporate segment, we anticipate expenses to be in the range of $615 to $655 million, which includes losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments recorded in the first nine months of the year, and elevated technology spend to support the growth of our business. Moving below the line, we anticipate interest expense to be approximately $220 million to $230 million, and income attributable to non-controlling interests to be in the range of $155 million to $165 million. We anticipate no change to the full year effective tax rate of approximately 18% to 19%. The timing of discrete tax item is difficult to predict, and therefore, we do not provide quarterly effective tax rate guidance. Turning to cash flow and capital deployment, we now anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion. Our working capital metrics and resulting free cash flow will vary from quarter-to-quarter, impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of a quarter. Our outlook also incorporates the impact of the October rate of bankruptcy. Our guidance reflects plans to repurchase approximately $3 billion to $3.5 billion of shares. As a result of this share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be in the range of approximately $134 million. Wrapping up fiscal 2024 guidance, as a result of solid performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Combined with our momentum, and confidence moving forward, we are increasing and narrowing our earnings per diluted share outlook for fiscal 2024 to a new range of $27.25 to $27.65. We anticipate operating profit will be a 2% decline to 1% growth compared to the prior year. Excluding certain items, we anticipate operating profit to increase by approximately 8% to 11% year-over-year above the long-term target range. As a reminder, certain items include the following; $1.90 related to fiscal 2023 U.S. Government COVID-19 program and COVID-19 tests in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical segments. A $0.65 benefit related to the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare in fiscal 2023. And gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments in fiscal 2023 and 2024. The increase to our outlook for adjusted earnings per diluted share indicates growth of 16% to 18% when excluding these certain items. Before I close, I'd like to share some initial thoughts on fiscal 2025. The momentum we've seen across our business over the past several years is expected to continue in fiscal 2025. We anticipate the U.S. pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical Solution segments will be more closely aligned to long-term growth targets that we've previously provided for these segments. Demonstrating our leading market positions and stable financial performance. We anticipate that the strength we're seeing across our solution set and prescription technology solutions will lead to growth at the top end or slightly above the long-term target. In U.S. pharmaceutical, we remain confident in our long-term target of 5% to 7% growth. Supported by sustainable momentum in the core distribution business and across our oncology platform. The U.S. Oncology Network, Ontada and the joint venture with Sarah Cannon Research Institute. As the leader in the alternate site market, we believe that the Medical-Surgical Solution segment is well positioned as care continues to move across the alternate site settings. Our experience and our relationships in every channel and setting of the alternate site markets enable us to capture the opportunity in the years ahead. We anticipate that the Prescription Technology Solution segment may perform modestly above the long-term growth target of 11% to 12% driven by organic growth as we expand our higher margin biopharma services platform. For the International segment, we anticipate continued growth in our Canadian operations. And throughout fiscal 2023, we completed divestitures of the business operations in 11 of the 12 countries that we operated in Europe. As a reminder, Norway remains the only country that we have not entered into an agreement to sell. And we intend to exit Norway as part of the completion of our European exit. Finally, we will continue to materially invest in the business on multiple fronts. We will sustain the pace and cadence of investment in product development and enhancements across our oncology and biopharma services platforms. These investments will further our differentiated capabilities and market leading positions. We will also continue to invest in adding capacity and capabilities to our North American distribution footprint. These investments include increased capacity, automation, and regulatory excellence capabilities. And we will continue to invest in data and analytics, including the acceleration of several investments in artificial intelligence. We see AI as unlocking the potential to deliver customer and foundational enhancements. Although in the early stages, we're using AI to improve patient intake and workflow, improve productivity throughout the system, including automatic clinical note generation, and several supply chain use cases, including supply chain disruption predictions, forecast accuracy algorithms, and fraud detection. Although we're in the early stages of our AI development and implementation, we're committed to increased investment to further extend our leadership positions and deliver value to our partners and stakeholders. To sum up, we see strength and stability in the underlying fundamentals of the business. We're pleased with our strong fiscal 2024 performance, and we remain optimistic about the outlook. McKesson is well positioned to continue to deliver strong results as we successfully execute against our strategic and financial framework to drive long-term, sustainable growth for all stakeholders. And with that, let's move to our Q&A session.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Charles Rhyee with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Charles Rhyee: Yes, thanks for taking the questions. Obviously, strong performance in RxTS as implied in the guidance. Maybe you can kind of give us a feel for the mix between reauthorizations versus new prior-offs [ph] in that mix. And as we think about through the course of the year as kind of new category, like this is sort of a category that's kind of grown significantly over the last year or so, particularly and if we think about the launch of Zepbound as well from Lilly, can you give us a sense of what the lifecycle typically is for prior-offs [ph] overtime as products mature? What does that activity look like? And maybe give us a sense for what you kind of expect right now, particularly in this, the GLP-1 category.
Brian Tyler: Thanks, Charles. I'll start, and Britt as always, feel free to add on. I'm first off, we're very pleased with the solutions that we have in this segment. We think the growth over the last several quarters demonstrates the value that they bring to providers. Just as a reminder, this segment, new brand launches, particularly high-cost drugs, are drivers for this segment. They typically require prior authorization. We have automated solutions there. So as those volumes grow, that's generally good for this business. The GLP-1s were a strong contributor in the current quarter. How the programs evolve will largely be dependent on payer decisions in terms of how frequently they require an authorization or a reauthorization. But certainly, it's been a good tailwind for us. And that's to the blizzard season. I'm pleased to say it played out in accordance to how we expected it to. It's a lot of work. The team really put their head down, had a good plan, and is pushing through that work. And we're very confident we'll end this blizzard season more or less in line with our expectations at the outset of the year.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please?
Operator: And next will be Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Eric Percher: Thank you. I appreciate the 25 initial commentary. And I wanted to focus in on specialty. I thought, coming out of the pandemic, we saw elevated growth. And you're calling out higher growth this year. And I'd like to understand how much of that is organic growth versus gaining of share and beyond oncology, an increase of share in multi-specialty. And then finally, I'd ask, with those practices you're acquiring now, I've seen you've known them for quite some time. What is it that's driving them to join today?
Brian Tyler: Let me start. I guess I'll start where you ended with the practices. First thing I think I would say is, we are very pleased with the solid growth in our same store. We can obviously grow our U.S. Oncology Network in multiple ways. We can add, we could add oncologists or providers to an existing practice that we have. We could Greenfield a new practice. We could onboard new practices. And really, we've been benefiting over the last few years from all three of those. We have been very pleased with our ability to attract new members to the U.S. Oncology Network. We've added, I don't know, 500 or 600 providers over the last couple of years. We've entered into six new, we added six new practices and eight new geographies over the calendar year of 2023. Why are we able to do that? We think it's not just great practice management. We've been at this for 15 years, so we've got a leading EMR, we've got leading technology. Britt talked about investments we're making to extend that lead. But I think we also have this broad ecosystem that includes Ontada, which helps us provide insights to our providers. It includes SCRI, which brings in clinical research and trial capabilities. And so we think it's that really broad value proposition, Eric, which allows us to compel the growth we're seeing in the U.S. Oncology Network today.
Britt Vitalone: And Eric, maybe I'll just add on, when we think about specialty product growth, we're certainly seeing specialty product growth across not only our largest customers, but across the mentioned [ph] health systems. And certainly as we continue to grow the U.S. Oncology Network and oncology in general, we're certainly seeing more growth in that area as well. So we're seeing growth in specialty products, we're seeing growth across the specialty providers that we service, and as I mentioned, we're also seeing significant growth from GLP-1 medication. So we're really winning across the entirety of our scaled business. And of course, as our customers continue to win, that's reflected in the volume increases also.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please.
Operator: And next will be Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Lisa Gill: Great, thanks and good afternoon. I just want to go to your international business. And you talked about how strong Canada is, but there's been some speculation in the marketplace around Rexall. Can you talk about the strategy in Canada and specific to owning a drug retail?
Brian Tyler: Well, I will comment obviously on rumors. Let me say this about Canada. We have a very scaled, broad and impactful healthcare services business there. It's obviously anchored in our distribution assets, but it includes specialty distribution capabilities, it includes retail pharmacies, it includes one of the best online brands in Well.ca, it includes infusion clinics, and it includes a growing biopharma manufacturer services business. So we're very, very broad in our capabilities and really one of the leading players in the Canadian health care landscape in general. We've been very pleased with the performance of the business. Britt talked about some of the investments we continue to make into that business to keep our growth trajectory going. And I'd say we're very pleased with the performance and very committed to the current strategy.
Britt Vitalone: The only thing I would add is similar to our U.S. business, in Canada we have very strong strategic sourcing capabilities as well, which our customers benefit from. And it's helping our customers win and helping us drive increased distribution volume. So very similar to the U.S., we utilize our strong, scaled strategic sourcing capabilities to help our customers win.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please?
Operator: And next will be Allen Lutz with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Allen Lutz: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Britt, you mentioned core operating expense growth was about 6% excluding divestitures. As we think about the current growth across your different businesses, is that 6% growth rate the right way to think about operating expense growth from here? And then is there any reason why that would tick higher or lower versus that 6%? Thanks.
Britt Vitalone: Thanks for the question, Allen. I think when you look at our operating expenses, what we strive to do and what we've been able to do over a long period of time is gain leverage on our gross profit. And so what we strive to do and what we've demonstrated is that our operating expense typically will grow at a slower pace than gross profit. Now we've been investing back in the business. And so as we've been investing not only in distribution capabilities, data and analytics, and now in accelerated investment in artificial intelligence, quarterly variability in that operating expense number, you can expect to see that. But generally speaking, you will see us generate operating leverage on a gross margin.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please?
Operator: And next will be Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Maybe, Britt, just curious what you're seeing on the generic pricing front and what opportunities we should be thinking about as we think about combination of drug shortages and just broader inflation trends in generic.
Britt Vitalone: Yes, thanks for the question, Brian. In generics, we continue to have a very scaled sourcing operation in ClarusONE. ClarusONE continues to partner very closely with our broad set of customers, is generating good sourcing benefits. I talked about the dual mandate that we focus on, which is driving low cost positions for our customers. At the same time, is driving the highest availability of supply. We've been able to do that over a long period of time. Our generics business continues to grow. And we're quite pleased with the sourcing spread that we're able to generate from our sourcing buy-side capabilities. And we think that our customers are benefiting as well. And we see that in high compliance rates. So it's been a competitive but stable marketplace in the generic space, but the capabilities that we have on sourcing, the ability for us to drive lower cost and high availability of product and generate spread for our customers in a disciplined way that has proven to be a good formula for us over a long period of time.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please?
Operator: And next will be Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Please go ahead.
Kevin Caliendo: Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. Appreciate the color on the Rite-Aid impact. I'm guessing my question is, I know we don't know exactly what's going to happen with the rest of Rite-Aid. We should hopefully know soon, but what are the assumptions built in for fiscal 2025 around the potential impact from whatever happens with Rite-Aid from here? Like, is it built in, your comments, and how meaningful can it be?
Brian Tyler: I appreciate the question. I obviously can't and not in a position to comment a lot on Rite-Aid. What I can tell you is what we've talked about for fiscal 2024. And Rite-Aid is not going to have a material impact on our financial results. So I would leave it at that. And in terms of 2025, we will learn more over the next few months. We'll give you more information as we give you further information on all of our fiscal 2025 assumptions. But Rite-Aid is not material to our financial results in fiscal 2024.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please?
Operator: And next will be Eric Coldwell with Baird. Please go ahead.
Eric Coldwell: Thank you. Good afternoon. This one I think is fairly obvious and fairly simple, but I just want to make sure. The free cash flow reduction versus prior guide, is that specifically and only due to the Rite-Aid impact? And if so, I guess the question is why you didn't take that last quarter perhaps when -- I guess maybe that's not a fair question given the timing, but I just want to make sure that's the only topic there. And then on the repo activity as well, slightly lower outlook here, three to three and a half billion versus prior 3.5. Is that also the Rite-Aid impact or perhaps due to valuation in the market or some other topic? Those are my only two. Thank you very much.
Brian Tyler: Yes, I appreciate the question, Eric. And you'll note that in our free cash flow guide for the rest of the year, the reduction versus the prior guidance that we gave you is not the full impact of the Rite-Aid provision for bad debt. So it is a key driver to that. So to answer your question very simply, yes, Rite-Aid and the bankruptcy is a driver on free cash flow reduction. In terms of share repo, I'd say that there's two things that are driving that. Clearly, we are taking a look at our free cash flow guide, but going back to our principles of how we deploy capital, one of the things that we've talked about is, A, we will buy back shares when there's excess cash on hand that we can't deploy in a growth format. And secondly, we're going to be looking at the intrinsic value of the stock. We want to be in the market and we want to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases, but those two factors are going to be important to us. And so we're going to continue to be disciplined. And so a portion of that is reflected in the lower share buyback.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please?
Operator: And next will be Stephanie Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Stephanie Davis: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I know you've given a lot of great color on this, but I was hoping we could dig a little bit more into the strong U.S. pharmaceutical growth and how to think about, in the lighter flow through the margin, is there anything beyond GLP-1s kind of doing that? And you made a comment on commercial COVID net of 30 million non-recurring, accounting for some of the growth that we saw. Could you clarify kind of any impact that would have on the margin floater?
Brian Tyler: Yes, so let me comment on a couple of things. We're really pleased with our U.S. pharmaceutical results. They delivered another strong quarter. Included in that, obviously we are lapping the effects of the government program of COVID last year. This year we do have commercial COVID vaccines that peaked in October and then really fell off. And we did have a one-time non-recurring charge in the quarter. And when you net the commercial COVID vaccine contribution in that charge, it roughly offsets the government program contribution from last year. So the performance within the segment is just strong, continued utilization that we're seeing in the marketplace, continued strong growth of specialty across all of our customer channels, and the continued growth in our oncology business, as well as, as I mentioned, I provided a number on the revenue impact from GLP-1s, which again, come at a lower margin rate and have been a headwind to year-over-year. So to just sort of sum up, it's just continued strong utilization in the marketplace in general, continued good growth of our customers and channels, and continued growth within our oncology business.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please?
Operator: And next will be Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Erin Wright: Great, thanks. So as I think about 2025, why is 5% to 7% still the right growth target for U.S. pharma, just given the specialty contributions and growth there and favorable generics environment? And just, do you think kind of the long-term growth has inflected higher at this point for longer? Or what are some of those offsets that we should be thinking about in 2025? Thanks.
Brian Tyler: Appreciate the question. Let me just start by stating that at the beginning of the year when we gave guidance, the long-term growth rate for the segment was 4% to 6%. Given the performance that we've seen this year, we increased that target, that long-term target rate to 5% to 7%. What I'm trying to provide you now is an early view into some of the qualitative factors that we're looking at and some of the momentum that we see going forward in indicating that that long-term range that we increased this year, we still see that as being the right number today. Now we'll continue to do some analysis and work and we come forward with our full year assumptions. We'll give you more insight into that. But just as a reminder, we have already increased the long-term target range this year from 4% to 6% to 5% to 7%. And we're certainly pleased with the momentum that we're seeing in the segment.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please?
Operator: And next will be Daniel Grosslight with Citi. Please go ahead.
Daniel Grosslight: Thanks for taking the question. One of your competitors mentioned that there may be an ability to renegotiate GLP-1 contracts as they come due to potentially extract a bit more margin for the drug supply chain. I was wondering if you could comment on your views of contract negotiations as those contracts renew and if there may be an ability to boost the margin profile of GLP-1s going forward.
Brian Tyler: Well, I would say this. I think we've talked many times in these calls that the first most important thing for us to do is make sure we get fair value for the services that we provide. And then obviously we want to provide as many services as we can in support of those products. And that philosophy is no different for the GLP-1 class than it is, frankly, for all of the products that we distribute. So, we are always in close contact and communication with our biopharma partners to talk about the value that we deliver, to talk about maybe the ancillary services that we could offer in support of those programs and to find ways that we can both support the growth of our respective businesses. And that's exactly the lens we'll bring to this product class and it's really no different than the way we run the business day to day.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please?
Operator: And next will be Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi guys, thanks so much for the question. You guys talked about continuing to invest in some of the longer term drivers of the pharma growth in terms of oncology, biopharma services, etcetera. I was hoping you could unpack that a little bit more and sort of talk a bit more about where you sort of see the most attractive opportunities versus the assets that you already have. Thanks.
Brian Tyler: Sure, I'll start and then Britt can tack on. First thing I would say is, I'm really pleased over the last several years, we have been very disciplined in making sure that we made organic investment or reinvestment back into the business. And, we view that as part of good portfolio management. I mean, our goal is to continue to extend the growth that we see in our markets and to innovate, innovating new solutions as part of that. So, now when we allocate that investment capital, certainly some goes into the core where we think we can get efficiency, better services, extend our base value proposition, but a lot will go into what we call our growth pillars and that would be oncology. So in one instance, we've talked a lot, it's about, green fielding our Ontada business or our data and analytics business. Obviously we've gone inorganic with SCRI and extended into clinical trials and research. We talked a quarter or two ago about some innovations that we've made in our RxTS segment when enhancing some of our solutions and frankly building and innovating and bringing new solutions. So, much like our inorganic investment, we are tied to our strategy and committed to business cases that we think will deliver more return. I think the one area that we probably highlighted more this quarter than we have in the past is investments in technology, AI, machine learning. Obviously, the developments and advancements in that field have come on fast and when you think about a business that operates at our kind of scale, we're very excited about the opportunities we see there. And when you think about like a U.S. oncology, Britt highlighted several places where we think we can use this kind of technology to make a better patient experience, make our provider experience better, and to continue to drive efficiencies through that business. So, we will continue to be committed to investing back in the business where we see good financial returns tied to our strategy.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please?
Operator: And next will be George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
George Hill: Hey, good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Britt, first one is just kind of a point of clarification. When you say GLP-1s as an EBIT headwind, you mean to margins, not to dollars. And then for Brian, I have a follow-up question on oncology. I guess could you just kind of talk about the Greenfield opportunity that remains in the USO business and do you think more about the opportunity to add providers, kind of add regions or add services into the installed base as kind of the way to continue to grow that business? Thank you.
Brian Tyler: I'll start with your second question and then Britt can come on. So, I talk about three ways to drive the U.S. oncology business. One is to acquire a practice in a geography where not, obviously, to add providers to an existing geography. And in instances where our criteria are met, meaning we think we can attract the right level scale, we can find oncologists that want to practice consistent with the way we practice oncology in our network, we are not afraid to Greenfield. Obviously, adding to an existing is faster, acquiring an established practice that we feel fits our criteria is probably second, and Greenfield would be third, but we have all those avenues open to us. And so, we look at the criteria, the population, the growth, the payer mix, these all kind of go into our formula as we identify which of those three avenues is the most viable.
Britt Vitalone: And the answer to your first question is we've talked about GLP-1s previously, and today we are talking about margin rate. They usually come at a lower margin rate than other products that we distribute. And as I mentioned, they have been an operating profit headwind year-over-year.
Rachel Rodriguez: And we have time for one more question, please?
Operator: Certainly. That question will come from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Carol [ph] on for Steve. Just a follow-up on the prescription technology segment of GLP-1s. Now that we're starting to come up against some harder coms, just how should we think about growth for this business tied to new versus renewed prescriptions? And what are some of the other categories we should be focused on as growth drivers outside of GLP-1s? Thank you.
Brian Tyler: Well, I think as, we think about GLP-1s, obviously, four quarters ago was a big growth quarter. We're going to start to lap that. I think my characterization is there will continue to be growth. That growth may or may not be linear depending on product launches, uptakes, how commercial, government, other payers adopt policies to manage these products. So I think it's going to be growth. It's going to be slowed compared to what it has been historically. And it's probably going to be a little bit lumpier than, we would typically expect just because of the size of the class.
Britt Vitalone: And I would just remind you that while the growth has been robust and we do expect the rate of growth to moderate as we go to future quarters beginning in the fourth quarter. We did increase the guide for the operating profit for the segment. So the momentum in that segment is really good. Prior authorizations in general, GLP-1s specifically, but also seeing good growth across other access and affordability solutions within the segment.
Brian Tyler: Well, thank you again, everyone, for joining our call. We appreciate, as always, the great questions. I want to thank you, Cynthia, for facilitating the call. And maybe just a concluding comment. McKesson continues to make really meaningful progress in advancing our strategy and our mission. I couldn't be more pleased with the consistent and solid performance we're delivering. And we remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver sustainable long-term growth. I want to make sure I acknowledge the contribution of the McKesson employees across really all our teams, all of our business. It is one team executing this enterprise strategy and I'm proud of what we've been able to achieve as a team. And I look forward to sharing more updates and more of our progress with you next quarter. Thanks again, everybody. I hope everyone has a terrific evening.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect.
Brian Tyler: And more of our progress with you next quarter. Thanks again, everyone.
Operator: Thank you for joining.

===== 2024 Q2  (2023-11-01 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Please standby. Welcome to McKesson’s Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Rachel Rodriguez: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome everyone to McKesson’s second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. Today, I’m joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today’s discussion will include forward-looking statements such as forecast about McKesson’s operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today’s earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com and to the Risk Factors section of our most current recent annual and periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Information about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results, can be found in today’s earnings release and presentation slides. The presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and updated guidance. With that, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Rachel, and good afternoon, everybody. We appreciate you joining us on our call today. We are very pleased to report another solid quarter and fiscal 2024 with adjusted results of above expectations demonstrating our ability to consistently execute against company priorities and create sustained value for our shareholders. In the second quarter revenues increased 10% to $77.2 billion. Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $6.23. When excluding certain items, adjusted earnings per diluted share increase 14% from the prior year. Our performance through the first half of the fiscal year combined with the continued momentum in advancing our company strategies gives us the confidence to raise our guidance for fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share. Our previous guidance range of $26.55 to $27.35 has been updated to a range of $26.80 to $27.40. McKesson continues to deliver on our mission of improving care in every setting. As a diversified healthcare services company we are making important progress in strengthening our portfolio of differentiated assets and bringing more value to our customers and their patients. Before I turn my attention to our company priorities and the second quarter results, I want to briefly discuss Rite Aid's recent bankruptcy proceedings. We have been supplying Rite Aid with a majority of their pharmaceutical products for more than 20 years. As they navigate through their reorganization process, we are working closely with them to provide continued delivery of products. We are closely monitoring developments, but as Britt will describe in his remarks, we anticipate that Rite Aids bankruptcy filing will not materially impact fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share. Now let me move on to our company priorities and I want to start by recognizing our people, including the diverse dedicated and talented team we have built here at McKesson. Investing in people and culture is foundational to our strategy and we offer many engagement programs and initiatives to empower our employees and allow them to express new ideas to contribute their unique perspectives and to care for each other. We firmly believe that we achieve our full potential when our culture is diverse, inclusive and focused on best talent. Our efforts fostering a culture of belonging are well recognized. Recently, we were honored to be named by Forbes as one of America's Best Employers for Women. And for the 8th consecutive year, we were named as one of the best places to work for disability inclusion, earning a top ranking score of 100. We appreciate all the hard work and dedication from Team McKesson and we recognize the importance of helping, respecting, and caring for each other. On October 27th, we celebrated our Annual Wellness Day called Your Day Your Way. This is the third year that we've celebrated this tradition and shown appreciation for our employees by providing them with additional day off work to prioritize their personal health and well-being. Let's take a minute to review the performance of the distribution business and the progress we've made driving sustainable core growth. In the second quarter, we saw strong performance in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. Over the past ten quarters, the segment has consistently delivered double digit revenue increases demonstrating our ability to serve and grow with our customers. In the second quarter, we continued to observe solid prescription volume trends, particularly in the category of GLP-1 medications, which contributed to revenue growth in the quarter. And over the past three years, we were honored to support the U.S. Government as a centralized distributor of COVID-19 vaccines. Our team demonstrated incredible agility and dedication and standing up a fit for purpose operation distribute the vaccines across the country. This past September, we started transitioning the COVID-19 vaccine distribution to commercial channels. We're working closely with the manufacturers to bring vaccines to patients in an efficient and timely manner. As one of the largest distributors of flu vaccines in the country, we have scaled channel reach and deep expertise in working with vaccine products. And I'm pleased to say that through October 20th, we have distributed nearly 8 million COVID-19 vaccines through our commercial channels. In the Medical-Surgical segment, we continue to support our customers evolving needs with a diversified portfolio of products and broad experience in medical-surgical and related supplies. As a reminder, while we serve many alternate site providers, the biggest channel within the segment is primary care including physician offices. We closely track market data and during the second quarter we observed general market moderations in primary care foot traffic. We also saw a year-over-year decline in instances of respiratory illness and flu which contributed to lower illness testing and patient visits in the primary care business. These dynamics impacted the segment results in the second quarter and our full year fiscal 2024 outlook. However, we remain confident in the fundamentals of the business and the strength of our scaled assets within the Medical-Surgical segment.

InnoMed: Moving on to the biopharma services platform, through strategic acquisitions and investments, we've built a set of highly differentiated assets within the Prescription Technology Solutions segment. The combination of these assets creates a powerful and scaled network that includes multiple touch points throughout the patient treatment journey. We are connected to approximately 900,000 providers, enabling solutions that help move barriers to access prescription medications. We're also connected to over 50,000 pharmacies helping patients afford their prescriptions through solutions like cash, copay and digital coupons right at the pharmacy counter. In the second quarter, we were pleased with the strong performance in the segment with double digit growth in both revenue and adjusted operating profit, driven by growth in access solutions including increased volumes and prior authorizations for GLP-1 medications. The year-over-year comparison was also partially impacted by lower prior year results which as we called out in Q2 of our fiscal 2023 included higher operating expenses resulting from the timing of increased headcount to support customer annual verification activities. One of the areas where we saw significant growth in the past two quarters is our access solutions, including prior authorizations for brands like GLP-1 medications. For selected prescription drugs, patients are required to obtain approval from their health plan, which sometimes can be very manual and cumbersome. What we offer is an automated technology solution that is embedded within the provider's workflow. Our technology solution introduces efficiency to the process. More than 40% of our prior authorizations are approved instantly and approximately 65% are approved within one hour. We continue to add new features and functionalities to improve the user experience. The latest feature introduced allows providers to share prior authorization outcomes directly with their patients when a health plan makes a determination. Through improvements like this, we help remove barriers and provide greater patient visibility to the prior authorization process. Solutions like prior authorizations are great examples of the success of our business strategy. It's also a reflection of our efforts to improve medication access and ultimately advance health outcomes for all. As an impact driven organization, we're deeply committed to advancing our strategy and contributing to positive changes in the communities where we live and work. This past quarter we celebrated our Community Impact days, which is McKesson's largest annual company-wide employee volunteer event. Thousands of McKesson employees participated in various community impact projects that aligned with this year's theme, Cancer Awareness, Prevention and Support. This year marked the 25th anniversary of the event and we will continue honoring this tradition and will work to find more ways to enhance the health of those who live in our communities. So let me pull everything together. McKesson delivered a solid second quarter, thanks to the contribution and dedication of over 50,000 McKesson employees, we continue to execute against our company priorities with focus and excellence. Leveraging our differentiated services and solutions, we're well positioned to continue to improve care in every setting. Looking ahead, we're confident in our ability to drive continued growth and strategic advancement in fiscal 2024 and beyond. And with that, I'll turn it over to Britt for additional comments.
Britt Vitalone: Thank you, Brian. We're pleased with our second quarter results which reflect another quarter of solid performance driven by operational execution and meaningful growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Prescription Technology Solutions segments. Before I turn to our consolidated results, I want to highlight one item that impacted our second quarter GAAP only results. We recorded a pretax GAAP provision for bad debts of $210 million or $155 million after tax. Within the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment for uncollected trade accounts receivable related to Rite Aid bankruptcy. We anticipate recording an additional provision for bad debts of $511 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. For trade accounts receivable that McKesson recognized from sales to Rite Aid in October 2023 prior to its bankruptcy petition. We continued to provide distribution services to Rite Aid post their bankruptcy filing, providing the same efficiency and operational excellence as we have for over 20 years. We're operating pursuant to an interim agreement for distribution services which is pending final court approval, and includes reduced credit terms of seven days and certain other items as Rite Aid continues to reorganize. We are closely monitoring developments and we anticipate this customer event will not have a material impact to our fiscal 2024, adjusted earnings per diluted share results, our liquidity position and ongoing business operations. The remainder of my comments refer to our fiscal 2024 adjusted results unless I state otherwise. Let me start with a review of our second quarter results. McKesson delivered solid growth in the second quarter, led by strong performance in U.S. Pharmaceutical and Prescription Technology Solutions segments. Our focus and execution against our company priorities positioned us to generate consistent, solid financial results. We'll continue to evolve and grow our diversified portfolio through focused strategic investments in oncology and biopharma services. As a result of our operating performance and outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are increasing and narrowing our full year outlook for fiscal 2024, adjusted earnings per diluted share to a range of $26.80 to $27.40. Moving to our consolidated results, revenues increased 10% to $77.2 billion, led by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment resulting from increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from retail national account customers, specialty products and GLP-1 medications, partially offset by lower revenues in the International segment resulting from fiscal 2023 divestitures of certain testing European businesses. Excluding the impact of our European business operations and completed divestitures, revenue increased 15%. Gross profit was $3 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 1% and when excluding the impact of our European business operations and completed divestitures, second quarter gross profit increased 8%, primarily a result of growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Prescription Technology Solutions segments. Operating expenses decreased 2% in the quarter. And when we exclude the impact of our European business operations including completed divestitures, operating expenses increased 9% year-over-year, which included approximately 2% from cost related to the second half fiscal 2023 acquisitions of RX Savings Solution and the joint venture with Sarah Cannon Research Institute. Second quarter operating profit increased 1% to $1.2 billion, again primarily driven by growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Prescription Technology Solutions segments. This was partially offset by slower growth in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, including lower illness season testing and the completed divestitures of our European business operations within the International segment. If we exclude the impact of COVID-19 related items of fiscal 2023 and losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments in fiscal 2023 and 2024, operating profit increased 12% in the quarter. Moving below the line, the effective tax rate was 23.5%, which included the recognition of a net discrete tax expense of $12 million. Second quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $134.8 million, a decrease of 6% year-over-year. Consolidated second quarter earnings per diluted share was $6.23, which represents an increase of 3% over the prior year. Excluding COVID-19 related items during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and losses within our McKesson Ventures portfolio in fiscal 2023 and 2024, second quarter earnings per diluted share was up 14% over the prior year. Turning to our second quarter segment results, which can be found in Slides 7 through 11 and starting in U.S. Pharmaceutical. The U.S. Pharmaceutical segment delivered continued momentum and strong operating profit growth. Our ability to drive sustainable growth in this segment reflects a few factors. The efficiency of our scale distribution operations, the investments that we're making to unlock new capabilities that will further expand and strengthen our value proposition for our customers and partners, a balanced approach to managing a broad portfolio of pharmaceutical products inclusive of ClarusONE generic sourcing operations bolstering our competitive position and enabling a nimble approach to customer demands, new product launches and market movements and continued investment and expansion in our broad oncology platform. We are pleased with the growth momentum across our oncology assets from provider solutions in the U.S. Oncology Network data and insights through Ontada and expanded clinical trial capabilities through our Sarah Cannon Research Institute joint venture. These assets contributed to revenue and operating profit results in the quarter, which exceeded our expectations. Second quarter revenues were $69.8 billion, an increase of 16% year-over-year. Revenue growth reflected increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from retail national account customers, specialty products and GLP-1 medications. These increases were partially offset by branded to generic conversions. The growth of GLP-1 medications provided a revenue tailwind in the quarter. As a reminder, we generally recognize lower margin rates for the distribution of GLP-1 medications in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. In our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, the growth of GLP-1 medications like other new brand launches has led to increased demand for our access solutions such as prior authorization services. Second quarter U.S. Pharmaceutical operating profit increased 8% to $815 million, driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products and increased contributions from our generic programs. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment delivered operating profit growth of 15% year-over-year. Moving to Prescription Technology Solutions. The strong results in the second quarter demonstrate the success of our product portfolio and the partnership with biopharma manufacturers that we've developed over the years. The strength of our differentiated capabilities and partnerships positioning testing to capture demand driven by strong prescription utilization trends, including the growth of GLP-1 medications. For the second quarter, revenues increased 12% year-over-year to $1.1 billion and operating profit increased 48% to $209 million. Second quarter results reflect increased subscription transaction volumes, which drove higher demand for our access solutions primarily related to prior authorization services and growth. The year-over-year growth also included higher operating expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, which resulted from the timing of increased headcount to support customer annual verification activities. Medical-Surgical Solutions revenues were $2.8 billion in the quarter, which was flat to the prior year, resulting from anticipated lower sales of COVID-19 tests and lower contribution from kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. Government's COVID-19 vaccine program. The anticipated lower COVID-19 related revenues were partially offset by growth in the extended care business and increased distribution of pharmaceuticals in the primary care business. Operating profit was $254 million, a decrease of 17%, driven by anticipated lower contributions from kitty storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program and lower sales of COVID-19 tests. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 related items in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, segment delivered operating profit growth of 5% driven by increased volumes of nutritional supplements in the extended care business. Based on IQVIA and other market indications, the second quarter exhibited moderating primary care market volumes. The Medical-Surgical Solutions second quarter growth rate reflects these market indications, which was partially related to a slower start to the illness season including illness season testing when compared to the prior year. Next, let me address our International results. Revenues in the second quarter were $3.5 billion, a decrease of 44% year-over-year and operating profit was $89 million, a decrease of 35%. Second quarter results reflect the year-over-year effects of the completed divestitures within our European business. Wrapping up our segment review, corporate expenses were $159 million in the quarter, an increase of 10% year-over-year. During the quarter, we had losses of $10 million or $0.06 per share related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio compared to losses of approximately $3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. As a reminder, the McKesson Ventures portfolio holds equity investments in several growth stage digital, health and services companies. We're pleased with the insights and the results that we are obtaining through this portfolio. And as a result, McKesson's investment may result in gains or losses, the timing and magnitude of which can vary for each investment. Turning now to cash flows and capital deployment which can be found on Slide 12. We ended the quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We delivered free cash flow of $825 million in the second quarter and $4.3 billion for the trailing 12 months. Our cash balance and free cash flow in the second quarter included payments totaling $529 million associated with settlement agreements for opioid related claims. As a reminder, our cash position, working capital metrics and resulting cash flows can each be impacted by timing, which includes the day of the week that a quarter ends on and therefore can vary from quarter-to-quarter. During the first six months of the fiscal year, we made $264 million of capital expenditures, which included investments in new and existing distribution centers as well as investments in technology, data and analytics to support our growth priorities. Year-to-date, we returned $1.7 billion of cash to shareholders, which included $1.5 billion of share repurchases and $149 million in dividend payments. Now let me discuss our updated outlook. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis. The following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. The guidance I'm providing today relates to fiscal 2024. Our outlook assumptions can be found in Slides 13 through 17 and our supplemental slide presentation. Let me start with the outlook for our segments. For the full year, we now anticipate U.S. pharmaceutical revenues to increase 13% to 15%. And operating profit increased 6% to 8% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution in fiscal 2023, we anticipate operating profit to increase 11% to 14%. This updated segment outlook incorporates the strong second quarter performance as well as further growth in our generic sourcing programs and specialty distribution, including our differentiated plasma and biologics business. Our full year outlook assumes that volumes related to GLP-1 medications will remain elevated compared to the prior year and may vary quarter-to-quarter. We anticipate to consolidate GLP1 medication revenue and operating profit growth compared to prior year will slow in our fiscal fourth quarter reflecting the inflection of volumes for these medications in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. We anticipate GLP-1 medications will continue to be a revenue tailwind for U.S. Pharmaceutical. However, distribution of these medications has a lower distribution margin rate profile and represents a headwind to prior year results. In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we anticipate revenue growth of 7% to 13%. We have increased our operating profit growth outlook to 18% to 22%, reflecting strong momentum in our Access Solutions and strong first half performance. We may continue to see quarter-to-quarter variability in this segment driven by prescription and transaction volumes, the timing, pace and trajectory of new product drug launches, the timing and size of investments to support and expand our product portfolio and the annual verification programs that we provide for our customers that occur in our fiscal fourth quarter. Our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment remains well positioned across all alternate site channels with unmatched scale, product assortment and capabilities. In the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, we anticipate revenues to be approximately a 2% decline to 2% growth and operating profit decreased 12% to 16%. For the full year, we anticipate volumes of COVID-19 tests to continue to decline compared to fiscal 2023 and the impact from COVID-19 related items will remain immaterial to fiscal 2024 results. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 related items from fiscal 2023 results, we anticipate operating profit to increase 5% to 7% year-over-year. Our outlook incorporates the second quarter results which I discussed earlier. We anticipate the general market moderations in primary care foot traffic. In part, driven by a modest illness season may persist through the remainder of fiscal 2024. Additionally, first half fiscal 2023 results benefited from an extended illness season, which did not repeat in fiscal 2024. Our outlook includes continued investments in our scale distribution network, adding state-of-the-art automation regulatory capabilities to serve the breadth of our customer base. These distribution network investments support the breadth of our non-acute customers and broader core distribution, for example COVID vaccines for physician offices. We also anticipate further investments in data and analytics to expand the channel reach for our medical supplies, pharmaceuticals and private brand product portfolio. Finally, in the International segment, we anticipate revenues to decline by 30% to 34% and operating profit to decline by 23% to 29%. This year-over-year decrease includes a loss of operating profit contribution from European businesses and transactions that we closed during fiscal 2023. In the Corporate segment, we anticipate expenses to be in the range of $600 million to $660 million, which includes losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments recorded in the first half of the year and elevated technology spend to support the growth of our businesses.
ClarusONE: Turning to cash flow and capital deployment, we anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.7 to $4.1 million. Our outlook incorporates plans to repurchase approximately $3.5 million of shares. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be in the range of approximately $134 million. In summary, as a result of solid performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, combined with our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are increasing and narrowing our earnings per diluted share outlook for fiscal 2024 $0.40 [ph]. We anticipate operating profit will be flat to 4% decline compared to the prior year. When excluding certain items, we anticipate operating profit increase by 6% to 10% year-over-year. As a reminder, certain items include the following; net gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments in fiscal 2023 and 2024. A $0.65 benefit related to the early termination of the tax receivable agreement would change health care in fiscal 2023 and $1.90 related to COVID-19 related items in our U.S. pharmaceutical and medical surgical segments in fiscal 2023. We anticipate the impact of COVID-19 related items will be immaterial to fiscal 2024 when compared to fiscal 2023. The increase to our outlook for adjusted earnings per diluted share indicates earnings per diluted share growth of 14% to 17% when excluding these certain items. When further excluding the contribution from the run off of our European operations, earnings per diluted share growth is indicated at 18% to 20% for the full year. We also anticipate the fiscal third quarter to be stronger than the fiscal fourth quarter based on the development of prescription transactions, patient visits, internal investments and the recognition of discrete tax benefit in the third quarter. In closing, we are pleased with our strong first half performance. The momentum across the business, including growth in our oncology and biopharma services platforms, positions us to deliver for our customers and our partners and to create sustainable shareholder value. With that, let's move to the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Eric Percher: Thank you. I'd like to focus on RxTS and specifically, Brett, you mentioned that the guidance reflects a strong Q2, but it sounded like there's a range of outcomes for the second half. Can you provide some context on whether revenue upside that you've seen this year on delivering on prior authorization for GLP-1 has been tied to manufactured programs versus the volume of scripts being written? And would it be wrong to assume somewhat conservative or some conservatism here on how second half developed? And last I'll ask, are there particular indicators such as denial rates or new starts that you look for as you're modeling this business?
Britt Vitalone: Yes, Eric, thanks for that question. I'll start and then certainly I'll let Brian add on to that. You really touched on a lot of the factors that we look at when we think about this segment. As I mentioned we've seen continued stable and strong utilization trends that certainly drives transactions which are services benefit from. Secondly, we've seen continued growth in GLP-1 medications as an example and our services primarily prior authorization support those programs that we've seen a growth from that aspect. As I mentioned in my remarks, there are a number of things that can create some variability and certainly can drive the segment from a revenue and operating profit perspective and you touched on a few of those. As I mentioned, prescription utilization is one of those. Certainly the timing and the pace and the trajectory of drug launches, GLP-1 category being one of those drug launch categories and certainly the timing of other programs like the annual verification programs that we do for our customers in the fourth quarter. So we've seen good stable utilization trends. We've seen new drug launches like categories like GLP-1 medications that utilize the successful prior authorization programs that we have and we've certainly seen revenue and operating profit trend in a similar manner to that.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next please.
Operator: Thank you. And next will be Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Lisa Gill: Thanks very much. Britt, I've got to stick on this area. Just really want to understand if I'd take the numbers that you talked about and the updated guidance for the second half of the year, it looks like the margin in Prescription Technology Solutions, what will come down pretty dramatically versus what we saw in the first half of the year, growth rate will come down. So is this conservatism? Is there incremental programs and expenses that you have? Is it, you know, any changes in the program? I'm just trying to understand how to think about this business on kind of a normalized basis and again, how do we think about first half versus second-half?
Britt Vitalone:
3PL: The other thing that I would talk about is, I mentioned earlier in my remarks is that GLP-1s are flattening out year-over-year to get to the fourth quarter because that's what we anticipate. We saw a significant inflection in GLP-1 medication volumes in the fourth quarter of last year and certainly we've seen elevated levels of GLP-1 medication volumes through this year, but as you kind of get to a year-over-year begin to lap that fourth quarter inflection point, that's certainly going to be another factor for the year-over-year and a second half component. So I think there's a lot of things going on here, but if you look at the business on an annual basis, I think you'll see very good consistent revenue and operating profit growth.
Brian Tyler: Yes. The only thing I would add to that Britt is that if you look at the growth in the trajectory the segment has had historically we continue to also reinvest in product extensions, new product enhancements, new products overall. We're excited about this segment. We're excited about the assets that we have and we want to make sure we continue to invest into this segment to protect future growth as well. And all those investments are reflected in our FY '24 outlook.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please.
Operator: And next will be Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Charles Rhyee: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I'd like to ask about the Rite Aid on the reserves, I know you kind of reached a settlement with Rite Aid for ongoing supply of the pharmaceuticals for Rite Aid as they reorganize the reserves that you take in, can you talk a little bit about how are you going to approach collections on that and how should we think about that in terms of the way you reserve for it and the way we should think about that the cash flows?
Britt Vitalone: Sure. I appreciate the question. Let me just go back to some of my earlier comments because I think that these are questions. First of all, we continue to provide distribution services to Rite Aid as we have for over 20 years and we're proud to be a distributor for Rite Aid and their customers. We did record a provision in the third quarter for those sales that we considered the uncollected trade accounts receivable as of September 30, that's the $210 million that I referenced. We anticipate an additional provision that will be recorded in our third quarter for those sales up until they're back to their bankruptcy filing and that's the $511 million. We have an interim agreement in place that is still pending final court approval and that interim agreement has different credit terms. They have shorter credit terms of seven days. There are other aspects to the interim agreement, but the key thing for this call for this group is that those credit terms are on 70 terms, which are different than what we had in the previous agreement.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please.
Operator: And next will be Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good afternoon guys. Britt Just a quick question from me. As I think about your operating expense line, pretty good level of improvement there especially in the margin side. How should we be thinking about the sustainability of operating expenses and potential gains going forward? Thanks.
Britt Vitalone: Thank you for the question, but I'm not sure what you're referring to, you used the word gains. As we think about our operating expenses, we have great operating expense discipline and the efficiency of our operations allows us to drive operating margin leverage. We've been able to do that for a long period of time. The success that we've seen in many of our segments really has allowed us to continue to reinvest back into the business. Brian just mentioned what we've been doing at Rx Savings Solutions or I should say RxTS where we've been reinvesting to drive additional programs and capabilities for our customers. But as I mentioned in my comments, we've also been investing in distribution network capabilities, additional automation and regulatory capabilities that we're going to benefit not only our operations but our customers. We're also investing in data and analytics. We think that's going to be important to drive the efficiency of our operations, the capabilities for our customers. So you should expect to see us continue to deliver operating margin leverage, but to continue to invest against our programs, our capabilities on behalf of those efficiencies and our customers.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please.
Operator: And next will be Eric Coldwell with Baird. Please go ahead.
Eric Coldwell: Hi, this is Eric. Was that me? I had a beep here.
Britt Vitalone: Hi Eric.
Eric Coldwell: He I'm good. Okay, thanks. Hi guys. I wanted to hit on the Med-Surg segment specifically primary care. I think you're under -- your comments on slow start, low ramp in the illness season is I think well understood. We've seen that elsewhere. I'm curious what else you might have seen in the quarter that could lend some color on the lower primary care volumes. You know, I've heard heavy travel season from some companies. I've heard others talk about vacation schedules, just the timing of the calendar if you will, but I'm curious if you have any more details or thoughts you could add on the primary care trend? And if you could, could you quantify the rate of growth change that you saw during the September quarter? Thank you.
Brian Tyler:
Tripledemic:
IQVIA:
Britt Vitalone: And Eric, I would just also point out that we are extremely well positioned across all ultra-sites of care and the confidence that we have in that position to service our customers, we're continuing to make investments and I talked about some of the investments that we are making not only in distribution capabilities in the network, but also in data and analytics to help support our customers and the product portfolio that we provide to them. So we have a lot of confidence in the position and the capabilities that we have and the investments that we're making are a reflection of that.
Brian Tyler: And we do think macro trends support the continued migration of care into these alternate sites or these more community based settings. So we are well positioned.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please.
Operator: And next will be Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Please go ahead.
Kevin Caliendo: Hi, thanks for taking my question. The Pharma segment growth continues to be really impressive and I'm guessing it's more than just the typical fundamentals of pharma distribution with generic pricing or generic mix and the like. Can you talk about how the mix is evolving? Maybe is it some of your oncology businesses, some of the clinics you purchased recently that are contributing? How is that mix changing currently to drive this sort of outsized EBIT growth that you're seeing?
Britt Vitalone:
ClarusONE:
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please.
Operator: And next will be Daniel Grosslight with Citi. Please go ahead.
Daniel Grosslight: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to the Medical segment and the cadence for the remainder of the year. If I just look at guidance, it implies around a 4% increase in both revenue and AOI from the first half to the second half, so flat margins. You mentioned a less severe flu season and some investments you're making in distribution and data analytics. How should we be thinking about the cadence of AOI for the next two quarters, particularly as we think about some of those larger investments you're making?
Britt Vitalone: Yes, it's a great question, Dan. I think for modeling purposes, I would guide you to model something very similar in terms of growth rates to the second quarter.
Rachel Rodriguez: Okay. Next question please.
Operator: And next will be Allen Lutz with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Allen Lutz:
ClarusONE:
ClarusONE:
Brian Tyler:
ClarusONE:
ClarusONE:
Britt Vitalone: Yes, I'll take the second one Brian. As it relates to your question on the restructuring, we did incur certain charges in the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2023. We also incurred additional restructuring charges in the first half of fiscal 2024. And so we're still in the process of finalizing the programs and the savings that we have are contemplated within our guidance. So the fact that we started this program in fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, continued the program really taking charges and organizing and integrating through the first half of 2024 and we certainly haven't seen all of the benefits from those programs to this point in time.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question please. Operator And next will be Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Erin Wright: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Two questions here. I guess, are you seeing the generic or easing generic deflation environment, has that been a material driver for you? Just to follow up on the generic side. And then on M&A, and you outlined the share repurchases, but how are you thinking about the acquisition pipeline from here? Where's the focus? What does the M&A pipeline look like? Thanks.
Brian Tyler: Britt do you want to take the first part?
Britt Vitalone: Sure, Brian. Thanks for the question Erin. As it relates to generics, our focus continues to be on a strong sourcing program combined with discipline on the sell side. We've been operating in a competitive but stable environment now for a number of years really and we're really not seeing any different in the second quarter from what we've seen in the previous several quarters before that. We're able to procure generics very competitively on behalf of our customers and we focused on stability of supply at the same time. So from a generics perspective, our programs are running very well. We feel very well positioned to continue to procure at a low cost and stable supply for our customers and the environment is conducive to us being able to do that.
Brian Tyler: And I think the second part of the question was on M&A. Clearly, one of our top priorities for capital deployment is to support the growth and the differentiated capabilities we have in our segments to continue to extend that growth. And so we are and continue to be active on the M&A front. Now we have a very structured and disciplined way we approach that. First is it's got to be aligned to our stated strategy and particularly our growth pillars. And so if you look at recent activities like Rx Saving Solutions or Sarah Cannon joint venture, obviously both very, very tied to our stated growth priorities. And then the second step of that process is to layer over a lens of financial discipline. We have many uses for capital, some internal investment and efficiencies and technologies and tools. Obviously, we have share repurchase hurdles that we can meet. So we bring a lot of financial discipline to the acquisition process to ensure that we're getting good returns for shareholders as we deploy that capital. So it's on strategy and has the appropriate financial return. We're very interested and we continue to develop our business development funnels.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please.
Operator: And next will be Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi guys. Thanks so much for the question. I had two questions. One on the RxTS business, are you seeing any sort of spillover benefit from GLP-1? I'm thinking like either you know an organization that doesn't use you, that does use you because they've heard about this with the GLP-1s or sort of a cross selling across your group of services within the segment? And then secondarily, on the medical side, one of your competitors on the outpatient side has seen some ordering impact because of sort of website and sort of a cyberattack. Has that provided any kind of material change in customer ordering within that segment in the last couple of weeks? Thank you very much.
Brian Tyler: So the first, I think your first question was as it relates to RxTS and this opening new avenues, I would just remind you RxTS is connected to 900,000 providers today and 50,000 plus pharmacies today. So we've had a long established relationship with them and I think we've been well known for quite a long time in that arena. So I don't think that we'd see anything material there. And then your second question was as relates to a competitor ordering challenges, I'm not really not going to get into the issues a competitor might have. I don't think -- we've spent a little bit of time talking about the trends that we saw in the Medical-Surgical business and reviewed those trends and I think those stand for themselves.
Rachel Rodriguez: And we have time for one more question, please.
Operator: Certainly. That question will come from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
George Hill: Hey, guys, I appreciate you sneaking me and I'll say, Brian and Britt, the oncology business has really been a standout over the last several years. I was wondering if there's a chance that you guys might give us any kind of sense of the scope or scale of the business inside of the U.S. drug segment with any type of number around it? And then Britt as a quick follow up, I guess given the ongoing agreement with Rite Aid, can you tell…
Britt Vitalone: Looks like he dropped off.
Operator: Mr. Hill, please proceed. I think we lost him.
George Hill: Can you guys hear me?
Operator: Yes, go ahead.
George Hill: Can you hear me now? Oh, I'm sorry, Britt, Brian, I don't know what happened there. Just the growth of the oncology business has been pretty impressive over the last couple of years. I was just wondering if you would kind of provide any color to kind of give us some sense of the scope and the scale of that business inside the U.S. distribution segment? Any color would be helpful.
Brian Tyler: When we talk about our oncology business, we talk about it as an ecosystem, everything from distribution to GPO services to iMed EMR, to community to [indiscernible] to the SCRI joint venture. So there's a lot, a lot of components that go into that. I think what we have provided in terms of sense of scale and scope is 2400 plus providers operating in 27 states seeing roughly 15 plus percent of all cancer patients in the in the community settings, so I hope that helps you get an order of magnitude.
Brian Tyler: Okay. Is that our last question? Great. Well, thank you everybody for the questions, for your interest in McKesson and certainly for joining our call today. Thank you operator for helping facilitate the call. I want to conclude by just reiterating McKesson delivered solid second quarter results. We saw continued momentum across the business and we're confident in our ability to deliver sustained long-term growth. As a diversified healthcare services company, we've made significant progress advancing our company priorities. And lastly and importantly, I want to make sure that I thank the McKesson team for all their contributions. It's incredibly humbling and proud to be able to leave the talented and dedicated team. Thanks again everybody. I hope you all have a terrific evening.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

===== 2024 Q1  (2023-08-02 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Please standby. Welcome to McKesson’s First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Rachel Rodriguez: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone, to McKesson’s first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. Today, I’m joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we’ll move to a question-and-answer session. Today’s discussion will include forward-looking statements such as forecast about McKesson’s operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today’s earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com and to the Risk Factors section of our most current recent annual and periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Information about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results, can be found in today’s earnings release and presentation slides. The presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and updated guidance. With that, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Rachel, and good afternoon, everybody. We appreciate you joining us on our call today. McKesson reported a strong fiscal first quarter, driven by really broad-based momentum across the businesses. We delivered $74.5 billion in total revenues and $7.27 in adjusted earnings per diluted share, both exceeding our expectations. The performance in the quarter included a favorable timing impact from a discrete tax item. But the thing we’re most importantly focused on and pleased with is the strong operational performance of the underlying business, which gives us the confidence to raise our guidance range for fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share from $26.10 to $26.90 to an updated range of $26.55 to $27.35. Before I review our business performance in the quarter, I want to provide an update on the utilization trends that we’ve been observing. In the first quarter, we saw solid growth in prescription volumes and patient visits. In U.S. Oncology, same-store patient visits grew at a good pace while we continued to expand the reach of the network. The solid growth in prescription volume trends, particularly in weight loss or GLP-1 drugs, contributed to the strong revenue growth in the first quarter. As we closely monitor the trends going forward, we are well positioned to deliver products and services to support the evolving needs of our customers and patients. Now let me move on to our business review, and I want to focus my remarks today on the progress we’ve made in executing on our company priorities and our differentiated market positions in the key growth areas of oncology and biopharma services. I’ll also discuss some of the key growth drivers for the quarter and as always Britt will provide additional details about our financial results. So let’s start with our priority of driving sustainable core growth. In the first quarter, we saw strong performance in the pharmaceutical distribution business, as reflected in the growth of the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, where revenue increased 18% and adjusted operating profit grew 14% when excluding the contribution from COVID-19-related items in the prior year. We’re pleased with the broad-based momentum across all customer channels, really, including higher volumes from retail national accounts and good growth in our health systems segment. We also have a long history of supporting and investing in the growth of community pharmacies. In May, we launched Pinpoint Community Solutions, a new inventory management system powered by our proprietary Supplylogix software that’s designed to help independent pharmacies improve cash flow, increase inventory efficiency and to maximize their operational performance. In June, we were proud to host the annual ideaShare Conference, a nationwide community pharmacy event that brought together more than 2,800 attendees. Through this form of discussion and education, we help pharmacists foster deeper community connections, strengthen their collective voice and discover ways to innovate and thrive using McKesson products and services. To support the sustainable growth of the core distribution businesses within U.S. Pharmaceutical, we’re also investing in our infrastructure to enhance automation and improve efficiency. In the past quarter, we opened a new distribution center dedicated to specialty pharmaceuticals. This new facility incorporates the latest innovations in supply chain automation and technology, and it’ll allow us to better serve our customers with increased productivity. In the Medical-Surgical segment, we’re dedicated to serving customers across alternate sites of care, and we continue to look for opportunities for new partnerships. In the past two years, we’ve partnered closely with the U.S. Government on important public health initiatives. And we’re really quite proud of the relationships we’ve built at both the state and the federal level through these close collaborations. Since then, we’ve grown our state government business through participation in cooperative purchasing programs. We’ve also built a dedicated government solutions team stacked with experience: sales, customer service, sales administration and legal teams with a shared goal of supporting successful government procurement and providing best-in-class fulfillment and service at every level of the government. As we expand our customer relationships, we’re also strategically managing relationships with manufacturers to ensure supply chain diversity. We serve a broad portfolio of national brand and private label Medical-Surgical products, and we’re enhancing our procurement tools and processes to better track domestic and international sourcing. Last year, our sourcing team traveled to more than ten countries, representing our continued effort to expand our manufacturing relationships and diversify our geographic presence. Let me move on to the next company priority, and that is expanding our oncology and biopharma platforms. In July, we were excited to welcome the Cancer Care of Kansas to the U.S. Oncology Network, growing the total number of providers in the network to over 2,400. The continued growth is a strong testament to the value proposition of the network and an example of how we continue to evolve and grow our portfolio of differentiated assets. With over 20 years of oncology practice management experience, the network brings significant value beyond just drug purchase savings. The practices in the network have access to substantial expertise and ample resources, including clinical and business services, innovative technologies that support high-quality patient care, efficient drug management and revenue cycle optimization. As one of the largest organizations of its kind, the U.S. Oncology Network is dedicated to advancing cancer care and enabling better patient outcomes. Since its initial participation in the oncology care model, more than 120,000 patients have been enrolled in the program across the network. Participating practices delivered high-quality care to patients while generating significant savings for Medicare. Recently, we announced the network’s participation in the Enhancing Oncology Model, which includes representation from over 70% of the physicians in the network. The U.S. Oncology Network continues to lead at the forefront of value-based care. In biopharma services, the success of our innovative products and solutions is reflected in the growth we delivered in the first quarter. Prescription Technology Solutions segment saw a 17% revenue increase and 35% increase in adjusted operating profit. We continue to receive positive feedback on our products, enabling us to further penetrate the market and expand our channel reach. Solid prescription trends, particularly the commercial success of the weight loss GLP-1 drugs, as I mentioned earlier, also led to higher demand for our prior authorization solutions and contributed to the strong performance in the quarter. We remain committed and focused on expanding the biopharma services platform as one of our strategic growth pillars. We continue to strengthen the relationships with biopharma companies who are the primary sponsor of this business. We’re also creating comprehensive value proposition for each of the stakeholders in the continuum of care. For providers, our industry-leading technology platforms help them understand the patient’s progression along their treatment journey and help the patients access their therapies faster. Through our electronic payer connections, we support payers who represent 94% of prescription volumes in the U.S. and offer real-time decisions and simplified support between providers and health plans. We’re also connected to more than 50,000 pharmacies, and we offer solutions like automatic coupon programs and central field distribution, helping them improve operational efficiency and ultimately, helping their patients lead healthier lives. Recently, we were honored to receive the 2023 Retail Excellence Awards from Drug Store News, recognizing the value of our retail solutions and what they bring to pharmacies. As we continue to make significant progress in our company priorities, I want to highlight our unwavering focus on our people and culture. We, at McKesson, believe that having the best talent is essential, and it’s foundational to our culture and strategies. As a company, we further defined our employee value proposition. We call it The Future of Health Starts with You to demonstrate our commitment to our employees and what makes McKesson a top employer. Focusing on care, meaning and belonging, we strive to build a culture that supports the well-being and growth of each individual who works at McKesson. We also offer employees the opportunity to form authentic connections and advocate for advancing the company’s culture through employee resource groups. We’re pleased to see the ERG membership grew by more than 70% in the past two years. Supported by increased employee participation, these resource groups are becoming an important channel to promote and strengthen our culture of inclusion, belonging and collaboration. Our focus on people and culture is an important pillar of our company’s priorities, and it’s also part of our broader initiative focused on enacting positive and lasting impact. We strive to deliver value to our customers and our communities, not only as a diversified health care services company, but also as an impact-driven organization. In June, we published our FY2022 and FY2023 impact report that detailed our progress in advancing our strategy and driving meaningful outcomes to build a healthier tomorrow for all future generations. We shared many great initiatives focused on making an impact through our four impact pillars: our people, our partners, our community and our planet. I’m very, very proud of what the team has achieved, and we’ll continue to track, measure and communicate our progress around these impact pillars. Now before I hand it over to Britt, let me pull everything together. McKesson delivered a strong first quarter, and we’re making consistent and meaningful progress with our company priorities. We’re pleased with the growth and momentum across the business segments, and the market fundamentals remain solid in support of the positive outlook we’ve outlined for fiscal 2024. I want to sincerely thank all of the McKesson employees. We refer to them as Team McKesson. What we have achieved would not be possible without their dedication and the commitment of each and every one of them. I’m tremendously proud to be your leader and grateful for your contributions to advancing our vision. With that, Britt, I’ll hand it over to you for additional insights.
Britt Vitalone: Thank you, Brian, and I’m pleased to be here this afternoon to discuss our fiscal first quarter results, which as you mentioned, are tracking above the full year guidance that we provided in May, and it reflects solid progress against our long-term growth targets. Given the strong start to the year and momentum across the business, we’re raising both our top and bottom line guidance today. I’ll first start with a review of our first quarter results and provide an overview of our fiscal 2024 outlook, including our updated adjusted earnings per diluted share range. My comments today will refer to our fiscal 2024 adjusted results, unless I state otherwise. Let me start with a review of our consolidated results. Consolidated revenues increased 11% to $74.5 billion, which was led by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, resulting from increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from retail national account customers, specialty products and weight loss or GLP-1 drugs. And they are partially offset by lower revenues in the International segment, resulting from completed divestitures within our European business during fiscal 2023. When excluding the impact of our European business operations, including completed divestitures, revenues increased 16%. Gross profit was $2.9 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 2%. And when excluding the impact of our European business operations and completed divestitures, gross profit increased 7% in the first quarter, primarily a result of growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Prescription Technology Solutions segments. Operating expenses decreased 4% in the quarter. When excluding the impact of our European business operations, including completed divestitures, operating expenses increased 8% year-over-year. Operating expenses during the quarter included integration costs related to our acquisition of Rx Savings Solutions and a joint venture with Sarah Cannon Research Institute, both of which were completed in the second half of fiscal 2023. First quarter operating profit increased 3% to $1.2 billion, primarily driven by growth in our North American businesses, partially offset by the completed divestitures of our European business operations, which are within our International segment. When excluding the impact of COVID-19-related items in fiscal 2023 and losses associated with McKesson Venture equity investments in fiscal 2023 and 2024, operating profit increased 9% in the quarter. We’re pleased with these strong operating results, which are above the long-range growth targets. We’re delivering durable operating performance and sustained momentum, and we’re executing against our strategies. Moving below the line. Interest expense was $42 million, a year-over-year decrease, driven by transactions within our long-term debt portfolio, which I’ll discuss later in my remarks. The effective tax rate was 8.4%, driven by the recognition of a net discrete tax benefit of $147 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 related to the repatriation of certain intellectual property between wholly owned legal entities that were based in different tax jurisdictions. As a reminder, the timing of discrete tax items is difficult to predict, and therefore, we do not provide quarterly effective tax rate guidance. Our effective tax rate guidance for the full year remains unchanged. First quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $136.6 million – 136.6 million, a decrease of 6% year-over-year. Adding it all up, first quarter earnings per diluted share of $7.27 represents an increase of 25% over the prior year. When excluding COVID-19-related items in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and losses within our McKesson Ventures portfolio in fiscal 2023 and 2024, first quarter earnings per diluted share was up 33% over the prior year. Turning to our first quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 7 through 11, and I’ll start with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Revenue and operating profit results in the quarter exceeded our expectations. First quarter revenues were $67.2 billion, an increase of 18% year-over-year. Revenue growth reflected increased prescription transaction volumes, including higher volumes from retail national account customers, specialty products and GLP-1 drugs. These increases were partially offset by branded to generic conversions. The growth of the weight loss or the GLP-1 drug category provided a revenue tailwind in the quarter. We generally recognize lower margin rates for the distribution of GLP-1 drugs. The growth of these products, similar to other new brand launches, led to increased demand for our access and affordability support programs such as our prior authorization services, which are offered within RxTS segment. The first quarter also marked further progress against our oncology growth strategy. We’re pleased with the growth across all of our oncology assets. We saw growth in the U.S. Oncology Network, supported by the strength of our GPO capabilities. And as Brian mentioned, recently, we added Cancer Center of Kansas to the U.S. Oncology Network, expanding the total number of providers in our network to over 2,400. During the quarter, we delivered solid performance and contribution from the U.S. Oncology Network. First quarter fiscal 2024 total patient visits were 19% above the prior year and on the same practice basis, U.S. oncology patient visits grew approximately 7% above the prior year. The joint venture with Sarah Cannon Research Institute is progressing well as we support the expansion and the advancement of clinical trials and clinical trial research, and we continue to invest in and progress our data and insights business Ontada. These oncology assets and capabilities are important pieces to long-term development of the segment, we’re excited about the growth and the continued progress that we’re seeing. First quarter U.S. Pharmaceutical operating profit increased 8% to $771 million driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems and increased contributions from our generics program, which included new product launches within the quarter. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment delivered operating profit growth of 14% year-over-year ahead of the segment’s long-term growth target. The U.S. Pharmaceutical operating profit growth reflects increased prescription volumes and the breadth of capabilities that we provide, including solid generic volumes and sourcing contributions, operating discipline, and the continued momentum from our oncology platform. Let me move now to Prescription Technology Solutions. First quarter revenues were $1.2 billion an increase of 17% year-over-year, driven by growth in our third-party logistics and technology services businesses due to increased prescription volumes. Operating profit increased 35% to $223 million, driven by increasing demand for access adherence and affordability solutions. As I mentioned earlier in my remarks, prescription transaction volumes showed solid improvement in the quarter. The increased transaction volume drove higher demand for our access programs, including our prior authorization products. During the quarter, we noted strong new brand prescription volumes, which included the GLP-1 drug category. The strength of our program supporting access and affordability solutions positions us to capture the demand driven by the strong prescription utilization trends. Our products continue to receive positive feedback and recognition for the value that they deliver to our partners. One example of this is CoverMyMeds electronic prior authorization solutions. Historically, the prior authorization process was a tedious and time consuming task for providers through the technology solutions that McKesson has, we automate this process providing a faster and easier way to review complete and track prior authorization requests. CoverMyMeds delivering value and returns for our partners by increasing connectivity between pharmacies, providers, payers, and biopharma manufacturers through next generation access affordability, and adherence solutions that are automated and integrated into provider workflows. First quarter results exemplify the success of our broad range of technology programs and support services. In Medical Surgical Solutions, our first quarter performance was in line with our expectations. Our core business demonstrated revenue and operating profit growth. Revenues were $2.6 billion in the quarter, an increase of 1% year-over-year and operating profit was $235 million, a decrease of 12%. First quarter results were impacted by anticipated lower contributions in the kiting, storage, and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. Government’s COVID-19 vaccine program and lower illness season testing, including flu and COVID-19 tests when compared to the prior year. As a reminder, the first quarter of fiscal 2023 saw an extension of the 2022 illness season, driving higher levels of illness testing and related products. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 related items from the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the segment delivered operating profit growth of 7%, driven by growth in the extended in primary care businesses, partially offset by a non-recurring expense of $12 million. Within the primary care market, we saw growth in lab solutions, equipment, and specialty pharmaceuticals. In the extended care market, growth was led by sales to new customers, which included increased volumes of nutritional supplements. We are pleased with the continued solid results, which are in line with our expectations. Our leadership position combined with operating execution positions us for continued growth across the alternate sites of care. Next, let me address our International results. Revenues in the first quarter were $3.5 billion, a decrease of 47% year-over-year, and operating profit was $90 million, a decrease of 35%. On an FX adjusted basis, first quarter revenues were $3.7 billion, a decrease of 44%, an operating profit was $95 million, a decrease of 31%. First quarter results reflect the year-over-year FX from the combined divestitures within our European businesses. Let me wrap up our segment review. Corporate expenses were $149 million in the quarter, an increase of 3% year-over-year. As a reminder, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, corporate expenses included the receipt of a payment relating to a prior tax receivable agreement in our previous joint venture with Change Healthcare. During the quarter, we had losses of $7 million or $0.04 per share related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio compared to losses of approximately $22 million or $0.11 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. As a reminder, the McKesson Ventures portfolio holds equity investments in several growth stage digital health and services companies. We’re pleased with the insights and results that we’ve obtained through this portfolio. The impacts on our consolidated financials can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment quarter-to-quarter, and as a result, the customs investments may result in gains or losses, the timing and magnitude of which can vary for each investment. Turning now to our cash position, balance sheet and capital deployment on Slide 12. We ended the quarter with $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We made $124 million of capital expenditures, which includes investments in new and existing distribution centers, as well as investments in technology, data and analytics to support our growth priorities. For the first quarter, we had negative free cash flow of $1.2 billion. And as a reminder, our cash position or working capital metrics and the resulting cash flows can each be impacted by timing, which includes the day of the week that a quarter ends on, and therefore it can vary from quarter-to-quarter. We return $770 million of cash to shareholders, which included $696 million of share repurchases and $74 million in dividend payments. During the quarter, we successfully completed a public offering for $1 billion of notes with five and 10-year tenures. Concurrently, we retired approximately $900 million of notes that were due March of 2024. These transactions reduced our interest expense and they further support our strong credit profile as evidenced by our recent credit rating upgrades. Our Board of Directors approved two actions in July. First, the 15% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.62 per share, and second, the Board approved an additional $6 billion of share repurchase authorization, bringing the total remaining share repurchase authorization to approximately $9 billion. These actions demonstrate the confidence that the Board of Directors and management have in the execution of our strategic priorities. Now let me discuss our updated outlook. The guidance I’m providing today relates to fiscal 2024. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis. The following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. I’ll discuss the key items beginning with additional details of our consolidated guidance, and a full list of our assumptions can be found on Slides 13 through 17 in our supplemental slide presentation. As we’ve talked about already today, we are encouraged by the strong performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. And as a result, we’re increasing our earnings per diluted share outlook to a new range of $26.55 to $27.35. As a result of this, we now anticipate earnings per diluted share to increase 13% to 16% when excluding certain items. As a reminder of what the certain items include, net gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments in fiscal 2023 and 2024, a $0.65 benefit related to the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare in fiscal 2023 and $1.90 related to COVID-19-related items in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical Surgical segments in fiscal 2023, and we anticipate the impact of COVID-19-related items to be immaterial to fiscal 2024. We anticipate operating profit will be flat to 4% declined compared to the prior year. When excluding certain items, we anticipate operating profit to increase by 6% to 10% year-over-year. Let me discuss the outlook for our segments. Our core distribution business within the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment continues to demonstrate its strong value proposition to our customers, and we anticipate further growth in specialty distribution, including our differentiated plasma and biologics business where our customers can access an expansive portfolio of plasma-derived products, biologics, oncology treatments, and other specialty drugs at competitive prices from a single source. During the first quarter, we experienced a revenue tailwind from higher volumes related to weight loss or GLP-1 drugs. Our full year outlook assumes that volumes related to GLP-1 drugs will remain elevated compared to the prior year and may vary to quarter-to-quarter. We anticipate this class of drugs will continue to be a revenue tailwind for U.S. Pharmaceutical as we support our customers through our distribution services. As I discussed earlier, these drugs have a lower distribution margin rate profile. For the full year, we now anticipate U.S. Pharmaceutical revenues to increase 13% to 15% and operating profit to increase 3% to 5% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution in fiscal 2023, we anticipate operating profit to increased 8% to 11%. The full year performance includes continued investment in our oncology platform and increased technology spend to support the growth of the segment. In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we anticipate revenue growth of 7% to 13% and operating profit growth of 15% to 19%, which reflects increased utilization and new brand prescription transaction volumes, including the GLP-1 drugs and strong demand for the access adherence and affordability, products and programs that we offer. We anticipate that we may continue to see quarter-to-quarter variability in this segment driven by transaction volumes, the pace and trajectory of new product drug launches and the annual verification programs that we provide for our customers that occur in our fiscal fourth quarter. In the Medical Surgical Solutions segment, we anticipate revenues to be approximately a 1% decline to 3% growth and operating profit to decrease 5% to 11%. For the full year we anticipate volumes of COVID-19 tests to continue to decline compared to fiscal 2023, and the impact from the COVID-19 related items will remain immaterial to fiscal 2024 results. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 related items from fiscal 2023 results, we anticipate operating profit to increase 11% to 15% year-over-year. And finally in the International segment, we anticipate revenues to decline by 30% to 34% and operating profit to decline by 23% to 29%. This year-over-year decrease includes a loss of operating profit contribution from European businesses and transactions that we closed during fiscal 2023. As I’ve previously discussed, we intended to deploy capital through share repurchases to offset the dilution resulting from the European divestitures. In the Corporate segment, we anticipate expenses to be in the range of $580 million to $640 million, which includes losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments reported in the first quarter, as well as elevated technology spend to support the growth of our businesses. Now, moving below the line. As a result of the debt transactions that I discussed earlier in my remarks, we anticipate lower interest expense in the range of $205 million to $225 million. Let me now turn to cash flow and capital deployment. We anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion, net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expense. Our outlook incorporates plan to repurchase approximately $3.5 billion of shares. As a result of the share repurchases activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be in the range of approximately 133 million to 134 million. Our portfolio continues to generate strong free cash flow. We remain committed to operating profit growth and efficient capital deployment, and our 24% return on invested capital illustrates our focus on shareholder value creation. In summary, our strong start to fiscal 2024 and our outlook for the remainder of the year results in an increase to adjusted earnings per diluted share to a new range of $26.55 to $27.35. Excluding the impact of certain items and the contribution from our European operations, we anticipate earnings per diluted share growth of 16% to 20% in fiscal 2024. Our outlook further demonstrates the shareholder value creation framework that we’ve discussed previously. We continue to be focused on sustainable growth and efficient deployment of capital. We’re pleased with a strong start to the fiscal year. Our 50,000 team McKesson associates continue to deliver exceptional performance. Our first quarter financial performance reflects their dedication as well as the strength of our portfolio. Through our expansive oncology and biopharma platforms, we’re supporting customers and patients by advancing health outcomes for all. We’re delivering faster time to therapy for patients, and we’re accelerating the discovery, development and manufacturing of new therapies. Our services and solutions are at the forefront of improving patient outcomes and ensuring more patients have access to quality care. With our strong underlying momentum from the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and our aligned focus on our growth strategies, we remain confident that we’ll continue to deliver long-term sustainable growth and value creation for our shareholders. With that let me turn it back over to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Lisa Gill: Thanks very much and good afternoon. Thank you for all the details. I just want to go back and just better understand a few things around GLP-1. So Britt, you gave us a lot of data, but when I think about the increase in the revenue from 9% to 11% to 13% to 15%, can you talk about specifically how much is coming from GLP-1s? And then I understand that between cold chain and some other things that the gross profit is less on GLP-1. But how do I think about some of the other areas that potentially can offset this? We’re hearing stabilization in generic pricing right now. You talked about growth in specialty, which I also think is generally lower margin, but some of the other areas, you’ve talked about procurement opportunities. So, I just wanted to understand two things: one, when we think about GLP-1s and think about the contribution to the revenue side? And then secondly, how do we try to bifurcate some of these things on the margin side, so we can have an idea of how to think about really modeling the margin going forward?
Britt Vitalone: Well, thanks, Lisa, for the question. There’s a lot to unpack there. Let me see if I can try to answer some of those questions for you. As we talked about, the revenue growth was very broad based across the company, but in particular, within U.S. Pharma. Certainly, we’re benefiting from stronger utilization trends overall, and that does include GLP-1s. And as I mentioned, they do provide a tailwind. Just generally speaking though, utilization trends continue to be solid growth and improvement. We’re certainly, as I mentioned, from a margin rate profile, GLP-1 have a lower distribution margin rate profile. But also, as I mentioned, the breadth of the portfolio that we have, we also offer affordability and access solutions within our technology segment. And those programs like prior authorization have been very well received. They’re providing a lot of value to our customers. And so there’s a secondary component to the services that we provide on behalf of those drugs. So just generally speaking, I think that the utilization environment has been – continued to be solid. The pricing environment continues to be competitive but stable. Our generic programs continue to perform quite well, particularly our sourcing programs. And we’re benefiting from just broad-based performance across all of the channels that we provide services to.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question please.
Operator: We will take our next question from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Cherny: Good afternoon and thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe if I can spend a little time on RxTS. Last year, it was almost like a discovery year in terms of the moving pieces that we saw over the course of the year. This year, really coming out of the gate strong in terms of profit growth. And I know you mentioned some of the prior authorizations. Given the noise and moving pieces we’ve had in prior authorizations broadly against the backdrop of GLP-1 and other areas, is that the biggest driver of growth that you see in the RxTS business? And how should we think about the, I guess, lumpiness or lack thereof that we could see over the course of this year relative to the fact that last year was a little bit more volatile than I think we would have all expected?
Brian Tyler: Thanks, Michael. I’ll start and talk about the RxTS business a little bit. We’ve talked in the past about the importance of mix in this business, the different financial profiles of the 3PL business, which had good growth in the quarter versus the more technologically oriented solutions that we have. And so that mix will always be important and did introduce some fluctuations quarter-to-quarter over our prior fiscal year. I would say, in general though, this business is going to benefit from the utilization trends that Britt talked about. And specifically, as prescription volumes go up, as the need for prior authorization services go up, that’s help for our business. And we’re going to win by winning more of these manufacturer relationships, extending our relationships in the places where we have them today, it’s spend [ph] more penetration, if you will. We’re going to benefit from those kinds of volume-related things over time. Now as new drugs launch, as they go through their life cycles, there can be some variation into the demands and needs of the services we offer, and that’s just a natural part of the business.
Britt Vitalone: Mike, maybe just one other thing that I would add is, we continue to develop this segment. One of the things that we’re doing is continue to add capabilities and programs within it. So as time goes on, we’re offering more services, which is certainly taking advantage of utilization trends. We added Rx Savings Solutions last year, so another capability with a whole another set of economics available to us and our customers. So I think what you’re seeing is the investments that we’re making within the segment and the additional programs and capabilities that we’re adding, and certainly the acquisition of Rx Savings Solutions is just adding to the growth that we’re seeing on a year-over-year basis.
Brian Tyler: We also continue to make investments into this segment, and that the timing of those investments isn’t always linear.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please.
Operator: And next will be Eric Coldwell with Baird. Please go ahead.
Eric Coldwell: Hey, thanks very much. Congrats on a nice report. So during the quarter, the health of one of your known customers, I’ll leave the name out was very much in debate and I’m just larger, bigger picture here. Curious if you could talk about, in general, when you see possible challenges at an account, what kind of protections do you put in place, whether it be just in time inventories, collection practices things of that sort. And also if a formal restructuring were to occur such as a chapter 11, what protections do you have then in terms of things like critical vendor status or other items? Just a lot of debate from the investor base in terms of what actually happens if a larger account has more pronounced challenges. Thank you very much,
Brian Tyler: Eric, thanks for the question and I appreciate where you’re coming from on this for probably obvious reasons, we don’t get into the health or the economics or the situation of our customers. We do stay very close to our customers. We’re always trying to find ways to help them to grow and find additional services and capabilities for them. So I feel good about the customer contacts that we have and our ability to understand their strategies and their growth – what they’re trying to do from a growth perspective. And I think the broad base set of customers that we have across each of our segments that feel comfortable with how we manage our relationships. Beyond that, I really can’t get into the specifics of our contracts that we have with each customer. Hopefully you can understand that.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please.
Operator: And next will be Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Please go ahead.
Kevin Caliendo: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess on the GLP-1s, I have to ask, just because it’s obviously such a big driver, but do you think that your share of the market corresponds to your typical share within a category or a drug? Meaning is have you been able to secure more supply or do you have any means is your distribution channel such that you’re have a greater percent share of that market than you might normally for whatever reason, whether it’s contractually or just the way your mix is set up?
Brian Tyler: I would think that our mix would be fairly representative of our business mix overall. We probably have our appropriate share and health systems, our appropriate share and independence, our appropriate share and large retail national accounts. This – there have been points in time where supply has been less than demand. We work closely with all of our vendors to make sure we get our representative and fair share, and that we can coordinate with them and communicate effectively with our customers. But overall, I’d say we would have the mix, he would expect.
Britt Vitalone: Yes, I would say that it’s a fair question. And as we talked about, GLP-1s did provide a revenue tailwind for our distribution business. But I would just remind you that the growth in the segment was very broad based. It was across specialty products. It was across our generics business, and it was really across each of the segments outside of GLP-1s. And that reflects the utilization trends. It also reflects the services and capabilities that we have that we provide to our broad customer base. So certainly GLP-1s are topical and have provided a tailwind, but the business is performing quite well across really all categories and our customer base.
Kevin Caliendo: Thank you.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please.
Operator: And next will be Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Eric Percher: Thank you. I want to ask a RxTS question that is somewhat GLP-1 related, which is as you see products go from tightly managed to more open access, how does RxTS’ offering change? And have you seen success moving from early restricted access assistance to adherence or other offerings?
Brian Tyler: Well, the – I mean, the nature of what we offer for the drug is often different at different points in its life cycle. I mean what you might want at launch will be a lot different than what you are at maturity, and it can depend on how other competitors come into the class. We like to try to think about supporting the products over the course of their lifetime. Obviously there, payer and employer decisions around how they want to treat certain classes of drugs can dictate the services that we might offer. And as these drugs are relatively new to market, speaking as an employer, I can tell you, employers out there are thinking about how they want to handle them. That’s going to be different for each of the employers, but generally it’s positive momentum for the business.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question please. Operator, next question please.
Operator: And next will be A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Mr. Rice, are you on the line? Please check your mute button.
A.J. Rice: Yes. Sorry. Hello everybody. I just wanted to delve a little bit into the oncology ecosystem. I think Sarah Cannon and Ontada are still in an investment mode. Is that meaningfully different from quarter-to-quarter as you lay out this year’s numbers? And is it meaningfully different than the investment level from last year? And obviously, as you’re putting this in place, you’re expecting it to have a benefit on its own. But I wondered if you could comment on the sort of flywheel benefit to the rest of the businesses from making this push in oncology that you expect to realize?
Britt Vitalone: Hey A.J., thanks for the question. Let me try and answer that for you. I’ll start and Brian can add on. We have been investing principally in our Ontada business, where we’re developing data and insights. And I would say that on a year-to-year basis, the overall investment is probably not vary too much on a year-to-year basis. Now quarter-to-quarter, that can certainly vary, and – but on a year-to-year basis our investment has been pretty constant. And as Sarah Cannon Research is really in the integration phase, and I talked about some of the integration costs for both of the Sarah Cannon and the acquisition of Rx Savings Solutions. But the investment that we’ve principally been making it and develop our Ontada business on an annual basis has been pretty constant year-over-year, quarter-to-quarter it would vary.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question please.
Operator: And next will be Daniel Grosslight with Citi. Please go ahead.
Daniel Grosslight: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to the generics environment. You’ve mentioned this a few times as a tailwind. If you look at third-party data, it seems to point to a much more benign generic pricing environment. So I’m just curious what in your view is driving this better pricing environment? How are you managing potential shortages that have got some press recently? And then for the remainder of the year, how should we think about the generics environment and that impact on your revised guidance?
Britt Vitalone: Yes. Thanks for the question. Here’s what I would say. In terms of our generics program, it is a combination of the sourcing activities that we have, which really reflects the relationships that we have across hundreds of manufacturing partners. And then it reflects the discipline that we have on the sell-side. And the combination of that has led to some really good results. Now we’ve also had some new brand or I should say some new generic launches, and we certainly participate in those new generic launches as well. And we had a few in the quarter that we benefited from. So the combination of our sourcing operations, the stability that we’re seeing in a competitive marketplace has provided us the ability to create spread, at the same time providing competitive pricing for our customers with a stable supply. You mentioned shortages, and we have seen shortages for as long as I’ve been with the company. From time to time, they will spike up like we had with some of the cold and flu products or the illness season products last year. Generally speaking, I would think that – I would say that the – what we’re seeing now from a supply perspective is more in line with what we’ve seen historically. Every now and then, you’ll have a product that will be more challenged. But the broad base of partners that we have in our sourcing program allows us to manage through that quite well. And the performance that we’re seeing in the first quarter, which is continued momentum from last year, that’s included in the guidance that we have for the full year.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question please.
Operator: The next will be George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
George Hill: Yes. I want to come back to oncology as well and talk about U.S. oncology. You said visits were up 19% in total, same-store was up 7%. I’ll assume drug pricing was positive. So we’re talking like 20% growth in U.S. oncology in the quarter. I guess can you give us a little bit more detail on McKesson’s kind of exposure to oncology, kind of like the practices versus the drugs versus the GPO? And is that type of growth profile kind of in line with what we’re seeing in all segments of the – of McKesson’s oncology exposure? Thank you.
Britt Vitalone: Hi George, thanks for the question. Let me be clear on what I provided. I provided some insight into patient visits metrics. And I thought that would be insightful. We had 19% increase year-over-year in total patient visits and 7% on a same-practice basis. I thought that would be insightful. And it also reflects the – some of the acquisitions that we’ve done or some of the new practices that we’ve added over the last year. So again, the numbers that I provided you were patient visit metrics only, and I didn’t indicate anything else besides that. I don’t know, Brian, if you want to comment on the other.
Brian Tyler: On the other side, I would just say, we have often referred to this as an ecosystem because we think about the very broad and diverse set of solutions that we offer here, and it’s not just the practice management, it’s the iKnowMed EMR, it’s the GPO services. It’s the revenue cycle management services. It’s the contributions of those systems to managing the clinical practice of oncology effectively. We’ve complemented that in recent years with Ontada, the data analytics insight business and our joint venture with Sarah Cannon. And I think – then there’s the distribution business. So I think when you put those all together, that’s why we call it an ecosystem because we think in many ways, they self-reinforce. And you’ve seen, in the last several years, pretty good growth in the network. I think that’s in part to that expansive value proposition and the attractiveness we represent to these practices as a partner to help them both provide the best patient care possible and to manage their business as well as they can.
Rachel Rodriguez: And we have time for one more question, so last question please.
Operator: Certainly that question will come from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi guys. Thanks so much for the question. I know this doesn’t impact you from a reimbursement perspective, but I was wondering if you could speak to sort of 340B and the impact on potentially on your PTS business. Is that something that sort of helps? Is it – does it have a volume fluctuation part in it? Or is it just something that as we kind of get fewer of these 340B prescriptions potentially as the market changes, that could have a modest impact, but is unlikely to really have a real – be a real driver there? Thank you.
Brian Tyler: So I think you asked a 340B relative to our Prescription Technology business. And I would say I would characterize 340B as not a particular driver of that business, just flat out. I’d say the impact of 340B would much more be in our resident pharmaceutical distribution business. And obviously, we’ve talked a lot over the past quarters about evolutions in 340B, whether those be regulatory or commercial actions and reactions. And our best view of all that is reflected in the guidance that Britt and I have provided this afternoon. Okay. Well, thank you, everybody. Thank you for joining the call. I appreciate the thoughtful questions and your interest in McKesson. Thank you, Cynthia, for facilitating the call. I’ll just wrap up by saying McKesson delivered strong first quarter results. Our financial strength is really a testament to the significant progress we’ve made in advancing McKesson as a diversified health care services company. We’re confident in our differentiated market position and our ability to execute and continue to create long-term shareholder value. Thanks again for joining us. I hope you all have a terrific evening.
Operator: Thank you for joining today’s conference call. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.

===== 2023 Q4  (2023-05-08 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to McKesson's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Nicole Kramer, Manager of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Nicole Kramer: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome everyone to McKesson's fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements such as forecasts about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com, and to the Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Information about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results can be found in today's earnings release and presentation slides. The presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and guidance assumptions. With that, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Nicole, and good afternoon, everyone. I appreciate you joining us for our call today. Earlier today, we announced fourth quarter results, closing out a very successful fiscal 2023. We delivered full year revenues of $277 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $25.94. When excluding certain items, adjusted earnings per diluted share grew 15% from the prior year, driven by momentum across all business segments. In fiscal 2023, team McKesson made significant progress executing our company priorities and advancing our position as a diversified healthcare services company. We grew our biopharma and oncology platforms through a balance of strategic partnerships, acquisitions and internal investments. We delivered growth in the core distribution businesses and we divested the majority of the operations in Europe, furthering our goal to streamline and optimize the portfolio. As we close out fiscal 2023 and look ahead, we're confident in our ability to carry the business momentum forward, and we're excited to update and increase our long-term adjusted segment operating profit growth targets. This is a testament to our strategic focus, consistent execution and confidence in the outlook of the business. Building off our differentiated assets and capabilities, we are well-positioned to deliver strong sustainable growth in the years ahead. Britt will later walk you through more of the financial details, including fiscal 2024 outlook and the updated long-term growth segment targets. I wanted to start my remarks today though with the foundation of all of our strategies, which is our focus on people and culture. Our talent is critical to everything that we do at McKesson. We strive to be the best place to work in healthcare and we're building a culture that not only unites the team, but empowers them to innovate and succeed. One of the important commitments we have to our employees is to create a workspace where everyone can be comfortable to work at their very best. In the past quarter, at McKesson, we celebrated Black History Month in February and Women's History Month in March with many great, great employee-led events. I had the opportunity to participate in many of these and I'm energized by the dedication and passion our employees have demonstrated towards promoting awareness and listening and supporting each other as Team McKesson. We have a strong employee value proposition and our progress in creating the best place to work is being recognized externally. Recently, we were pleased to be named by Forbes as one of America's Best Large Employers, earning the third highest ranking in healthcare. We were also named by Newsweek as one of America's Greatest Places for Work for Women among many, many more recognitions. I'm very proud of the accomplishments, togetherness and the alignment of our team. Our second company priority is to drive sustainable core growth. In US Pharmaceutical, the core pharmaceutical distribution business continues to support the growth momentum of the segment. In fiscal 2023, the segment revenue increased 13% and adjusted operating profit excluding COVID-19 related contributions increased 8%, representing the highest profit growth rate since we formed this segment. We renewed our longstanding relationship with CVS and delivered strong value propositions to support customers across all channels, partnering with them to help solve their most immediate business needs. Our ability to consistently deliver high-quality services is supported by our deep expertise in pharmaceutical distribution and scaled network of assets. We continue to invest in the infrastructure to improve efficiency and modernize the network in support of our growth and in pursuit of efficiencies. In October 2022, we opened a new state-of-the-art pharmaceutical distribution center in Ohio. This is one of our most technologically advanced facilities. It leverages automation to increase efficiency, increased productivity and enhance the employee experience. Leveraging our scaled distribution network and logistics expertise, we have supported the US government and its initiatives of distributing COVID-19 vaccine and the kitting and storage of ancillary kits. Both government contracts are scheduled to expire in July of 2023. Looking back at the past two years, Team McKesson has demonstrated incredible agility, dedication and commitment in standing up the operation and in distributing millions of life saving vaccines across the country. We've gained invaluable experience, deepened our relationship with government partners and proven our value capabilities and expertise. The next priority I want to talk about is our priority to expand the oncology and biopharma platforms. Through years of focused investment and execution, we have built differentiated assets and capabilities in oncology and in biopharma services, and we've strengthened our market positions in these high-growth and high-margin areas. I'll start with the oncology platform. One of the pillars of our oncology platform is the distribution capability. We are the leading distributor in the community oncology market with a scale reached providers in the community setting. Biologics, our specialty pharmacy supports more than 3,500 specialty practices with cancer and other rare disease medications. Through our GPO services, Onmark and Unity, we serve thousands of oncology physicians and deliver significant savings on oncology drug purchases for practices, both within the US Oncology Network and other community-based practices. Fiscal 2023 has been a year of significant growth for our practice management business. The US Oncology Network welcomed three new practices, Epic Care, Nexus Health, and most recently, the Regional Cancer Care Associates as effective as of April 1st, 2023. With these additions, the number of providers grew by more than 450 to a total exceeding over 2,300. This represents the fastest growth period since we acquired the US Oncology Network in 2010. These new practices expand the reach of the network into new geographies and enhance its commitment to providing high quality care close to home. In addition, through the expansion and footprint, we continue to empower the growth of individual oncology practices to ensure that they are at the forefront of cancer care. Physicians in the network stand out as thought leaders in the industry with participation and leading publications and leadership roles within the industry. The network also plays a leading role in the transformation to value-based care, including its participation in the oncology care model. In October 2022, US Oncology Research formed a joint venture with HCA's Sarah Cannon Research Institute, creating a fully-integrated oncology research organization. We expect this transaction to accelerate our oncology strategy, expand clinical research and increase access to clinical trials for community oncology providers and more importantly for patients. We are pleased with the performance across the oncology platform and we believe our differentiated set of assets allows us to be a key partner of choice across both providers and biopharma companies. In addition to the momentum in the oncology platform, we're also making significant progress in growing our assets and capabilities in the biopharma platform. We continue to enhance the way as patients get their medications by improving access, affordability and adherence to prescription medications. In this past year, we managed programs that help patients save more than $8 billion on branded and specialty medications and prevented approximately 9.9 million prescriptions from being abandoned due to affordability challenges. This helped patients get access to medicine more than 78 million times. In November of 2022, we completed the acquisition of Rx Savings Solutions, a prescription price transparency and benefit insight company. The acquisition expands our affordability and adherence capabilities and set the foundation for the expansion of outcomes, management and evidence-based biopharma and payer services. For the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, our fiscal fourth quarter is usually the busiest quarter of the year, driven by customer annual verification activities. Our employees had a particularly busy season this past quarter, assisting the highest volume of patients in the history of the segment. We continue to see strong market demand for the products and services we provide, which supports the growth outlook of this segment. While we're committed to grow the biopharma platform, we're also continually looking for opportunities to optimize the portfolio of products and services we offer. We have a disciplined review process to ensure that our resources are aligned with the areas of most strategic priority. In this past quarter, we made the decision to re-prioritize investments of products within the Prescription Technology Solutions segment that we believe have reached the end of their life cycle and are no longer essential to the growth strategy. These actions will allow us to improve operational efficiency and more importantly, to better focus investments in other strategic areas and to maximize our resources for growth opportunities. These types of decisions are always difficult and it had a direct impact on some of our employees. I am deeply grateful for the contributions of all our Prescription Technology Solution employees have made that have led to the significant growth in this segment for the past several years. As part of this initiative, we are also streamlining the real-estate assets, supporting more flexibility for our employees. We remain confident about our differentiated capabilities, the market opportunity and our ability to achieve the long-term growth target of this segment. Another important portfolio action we are executing is the divestiture of our European businesses. We have now successfully divested businesses in 11 of the 12 countries with Norway being the only country for which we are still exploring alternatives. As we make significant progress in expanding the strategic growth areas, we are doing so in a way that allows us to deliver for all our stakeholders. We're committed to drive sustainability and to execute on initiatives that are aligned to our business strategy, support our growth and contribute to measurable and enduring positive impacts and health outcomes for our stakeholders and communities. We look forward to publishing our impact report in June to share our progress on these important initiatives. Earlier this year, our near-term science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets were approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. Focused on energy, transportation and real estate, our teams are taking meaningful actions to achieve these targets and improve the business. Recently, we were included in Sustainalytics 2023 Industry Top-Rated ESG Companies list, recognizing our comprehensive commitment and achievements in environmental, social and governance-related issues. So let me pull everything together. McKesson reported a strong fourth quarter and full year results. Looking back to fiscal 2023, we made significant progress in advancing our company priorities. We executed on our strategy with focus and dedication. We invested in our businesses and our people for future growth. And as a diversified healthcare services company, we enacted positive changes to our customers, partners and their patients. I'm incredibly proud of what we have achieved as a team, and I'm confident in our ability to continue the momentum and deliver sustainable growth as reflected in our updated long-term segment growth targets. With that, Britt, I'll hand it over to you for additional comments.
Britt Vitalone: Well, thank you, Brian. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2023 results, and then I'll provide an overview of our fiscal 2024 outlook, including our updated long-term adjusted segment operating profit growth targets. My comments today will refer to our fiscal 2023 adjusted results unless I state otherwise. We delivered strong fourth quarter results. Earnings per diluted share was $7.19, an increase of 23% compared to the prior year. These results were right in line with the guidance we provided on our third quarter earnings call. Our results demonstrate the breadth of McKesson's strength as a leading diversified healthcare services company with strong performance in growth in each of our core operating businesses. For the full year earnings per diluted share increased 9% year-over-year, $25.94, driven by a lower share count in growth in the US Pharmaceutical segment, partially offset by lower contributions in the International segment as a result of the completed divestitures of McKesson's European businesses. Full year earnings per diluted share also included $2.36 related to the following certain items, which can also be found on slide 23, in the appendix to our earnings presentation. $0.78 related to the US government centralized COVID-19 vaccine distribution program, $1.12 related to COVID-19 tests and the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the US government, $0.65 related to the early termination of the tax receivable agreement or TRA with Change Healthcare, and $0.19 related to net losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments. Excluding these certain items, earnings per diluted share increased 15% year-over-year, above our previously communicated long-term growth rate target. Our strong full year results are broad-based and reflect our ongoing commitment to deliver sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value. Before I turn to our consolidated results, I want to highlight one item that impacted our fourth quarter GAAP-only results. We remain focused on strategically managing the company to deliver differentiated customer value as well as long-term financial growth and profitability. In support of delivering sustainable value, innovation and growth, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we announced a broad set of initiatives to simplify our infrastructure, drive operational efficiencies and increased cost optimization. These initiatives include headcount reductions and the exit or downsizing of certain facilities. During the fourth quarter, we recorded charges of $60 million related to these initiatives, which includes severance and other employee-related costs within our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, asset impairment and accelerated depreciation, including certain asset impairments, primarily within our US Pharmaceutical segment, and real estate charges within corporate. We anticipate total charges of approximately $125 million within our Prescription Technology Solutions and US pharmaceutical segment, as well as corporate to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2024. Moving now to our consolidated results. Our consolidated revenues increased 4% to $68.9 billion in the fourth quarter, for the full year increased 5% to $276.7 billion. Fourth quarter and full year results were driven by growth in the US Pharmaceutical segment, including increased specialty product volumes from retail national account customers, partially offset by lower revenues in the International segment as a result of the completed divestitures of McKesson's European businesses. Excluding the impact of the European business operations, including these completed divestitures, revenues increased 13% in the fourth quarter and 12% in the full year when compared to fiscal 2022. Gross profit was $3.1 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 8%. For the full year, gross profit was $12.2 billion, a decrease of 7%. Excluding the impact of our European business operations and completed divestitures, gross profit increased 9% in fourth quarter and 8% in the full year, primarily as a result of growth in the US Pharmaceutical and Prescription Technology Solutions segments. Operating expenses decreased 14% in the quarter and 13% for the full year, largely driven by completed European divestitures in our International segment and lower opioid litigation costs. Excluding the impact of our European business operations and the completed divestitures, operating expenses increased 8% in both the fourth quarter and the full year. Fourth quarter operating profit increased 4% to $1.3 billion, driven by growth in the US Pharmaceutical segment, including solid contributions from our generics program and Prescription Technology Solutions growth more than offsetting the impact from completed divestitures in the International segment. Full year operating profit increased 3% to $5 billion, primarily led by growth in our North American businesses, partially offset by these completed divestitures in our International segment and lower contributions from COVID-19 related items year-over-year. When excluding the impact related to the distribution of COVID-19 related products, a pre-tax benefit of $126 million related to the early termination of the TRA with Change Healthcare in the third quarter and net gains or losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments, operating profit increased 9% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year when compared to fiscal 2022. Moving below the line, interest expense was $70 million in the quarter and $239 million for the full year. The increase was primarily due to impacts from higher interest rates. Effective tax rate was 12.9% for the quarter and 18.8% for the full year, in line with our original guidance. As a reminder, our effective tax rate can vary quarter-to-quarter, driven by our mix of income and the timing of discrete tax items. Wrapping up our consolidated results, fourth quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $138 million, a decrease of 8% year-over-year. Turning to our fourth quarter and full year segment results, which can be found on slides seven through 12 and starting with US Pharmaceutical. Our US Pharmaceutical business is a scaled efficient business and comprises the breadth and depth of services and capabilities, including our growing oncology platform, and we're pleased with the momentum in this segment. Fourth quarter revenues were $61.7 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year, driven by growth across all customer segments, including increased volume of specialty products, higher volumes from retail national account customers and market growth which was partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Fourth quarter operating profit increased 10% to $861 million and for the full year increased 6% to $3.1 billion, driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems and increased contributions from our generics program. We remain pleased with the performance of our generics program, led by stable market fundamentals and the strength of our sourcing operations. We continue to provide solid value to our customers and partners delivering low cost and stable supply. Our contract with the US government for COVID-19 vaccine distribution provided an operating profit benefit of approximately $21 million or $0.11 per share in the fourth quarter, compared to $12 million or $0.06 per share in the fourth quarter of the prior year. For the full year, this contract provided a benefit of $149 million or $0.78 per share compared to a $186 million or $0.89 per share in fiscal 2022. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution, US Pharmaceutical segment delivered operating profit growth of 9% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year compared to fiscal 2022 results, which were ahead of the segment's long-term growth target. In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, fourth quarter revenues were $1.2 billion, an increase of 16% year-over-year, driven by growth in prescription volumes in our third-party logistics business and access and adherence solutions transaction volumes. Fourth quarter operating profit increased 35% to $218 million, and full year operating profit increased 15% to $679 million, driven by growth in access and affordability solutions. Fourth quarter results were also positively impacted by annual customer verification support activities as well as increased volume growth, partially due to the commercial success of the brands we serve. Through a comprehensive suite of solutions and services, McKesson helps patients access to their medicine over 24 million times in the fourth quarter, the highest number of patients assisted in the segment's history. This segment produced strong fourth quarter results and full year performance was in line with our original guidance. Moving now to Medical Surgical Solutions. In the fourth quarter, revenues were $2.7 billion, a decrease of 6% year-over-year and operating profit was $248 million, a decrease of 17%. For the full year, operating profit declined 4% to $1.2 billion. Fourth quarter and full year results were impacted by lower sales of COVID-19 tests and lower contribution from kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies, the US government's COVID-19 program, partially offset by growth in the primary care business, including favorable sourcing activities in illness season testing compared to the prior year. Contribution from COVID-19 tests and our contract with the US government for the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies provided a total benefit of $31 million, or $0.16 per share in the fourth quarter compared to $85 million or $0.42 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. For the full year COVID-19 related items provided a benefit of $216 million, or $1.12 per share compared to $371 million or $1.78 per share in fiscal 2022. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 related items, the segment delivered operating profit growth of 2% in the fourth quarter and 13% for the full year compared to fiscal 2022 results, which was at the upper end of the original guidance range that we provided. Next, let me address our International results. Revenues in the fourth quarter were $3.4 billion, a decrease of 61% year-over-year and operating profit was $80 million, a decrease of 46%. On an FX adjusted basis, fourth quarter revenues were $3.6 billion, a decrease of 58%, and operating profit was $88 million, a decrease of 40%. For the full year, operating profit on an FX-adjusted basis decreased by 22%. Fourth quarter and full year results reflect the year-over-year effects in the completed divestitures within our European businesses. In wrapping up our segment review, corporate expenses were $149 million in the quarter, a decrease of 19% year-over-year. For the full-year, corporate expenses were $457 million, a decrease of 21%, which included a pre-tax benefit of $126 million related to the early termination of the tax receivable agreement or TRA with Change Healthcare in the third quarter. Corporate expenses in the fourth quarter and full year were positively impacted by lower opioid-related expenses compared to the prior year. During the quarter, we had net losses of $12 million, or $0.06 per share related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures' portfolio compared to net losses of approximately $6 million or $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. For the full year, McKesson had net losses related to equity investments within our McKesson Ventures' portfolio of approximately $36 million, or $0.19 per share. This compares to net gains of approximately $98 million, or $0.47 per share for the full year fiscal 2022. As a reminder, McKesson Ventures' portfolio holds equity investments in several growth-stage digital health and services companies, and we're pleased with the insights and the results we've obtained through this portfolio. The impacts on consolidated financials can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment quarter-to-quarter. And as a result, McKesson's investments may result in gains or losses, the timing and magnitude of which can vary for each investment. Excluding the benefit from the early termination, or the TRA, and net gains and losses within the McKesson Ventures' portfolio, corporate expenses decreased 23% and 19% in the fourth quarter and full year respectively. Turning now to our cash position and capital deployment, which can be found on slide 13. For the fiscal year, we generated record cash flow, reflecting the broad-based strength of our businesses, the focus on working capital efficiency and disciplined capital investment. For the full year, we generated $4.6 billion in free cash flow, including $558 million of capital expenditures, which include investments to support our strategic pillars of oncology and biopharma services as well as investments in our distribution centers. We used our strong balance sheet to return $3.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases, including $138 million in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we entered a new share repurchase program, which allows up to $1 billion of new repurchases. I'll speak about our share repurchase guidance for fiscal 2024 in a few minutes. Additionally, we paid dividends of $292 million for the full year, and we remain committed to growing the dividend in line with earnings growth. When combining share repurchases with dividends paid, we returned approximately 85% of free cash flow to shareholders in fiscal 2023. We continue to utilize capital deployment as a method to drive value for our shareholders. Since the beginning of fiscal 2019, we returned $12.9 billion of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Of this amount, approximately $11.5 billion has been returned through share repurchases, we do see our total shares outstanding by approximately 33%. Our strong operating performance, combined our return of capital to shareholders, reinforces our commitment to driving shareholder value. Now, let me spend a few minutes discussing our outlook for fiscal 2024. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis, so the following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Rather than outlining each assumption, I'll instead walk you through the key items beginning with additional details of fiscal '24 consolidated guidance. A full list of our assumptions can be found on slides 14 through 19 in our supplemental slide presentation. Fiscal '23 was a strong year where we exceeded our full year operating profit, earnings per share and cash-flow guidance that we laid out at the beginning of May last year. These results have increased our confidence and our outlook. Strategies that we've discussed today are delivering and we expect that they will continue to deliver strong levels of operating profit, earnings per share growth and robust cash flow generation. We anticipate earnings per diluted share of $26.10 to $26.90 for fiscal '24, which contemplates operating profit growth across each of our core operating businesses when excluding COVID-19 related items, supplemented by disciplined capital deployment. We anticipate earnings per diluted share to increase 11% to 14% in fiscal '24 when excluding a $1.90 related to COVID-19 related items, $0.19 of net losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments and $0.65 benefit related to the early termination of the TRA with Change Healthcare in fiscal 2023. Let me start by discussing our approach to COVID-19 related items in our fiscal '24 outlook. Since the onset of the pandemic, McKesson has played a central role in providing support for the US government's distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies as well as providing the distribution of COVID-19 tests to our customers. Looking ahead to fiscal 2024 and the scheduled completion of our COVID-19 contracts with US government in July of 2023, we anticipate that the impact from COVID-19 related items, including COVID-19 tests will be immaterial to fiscal '24 results. As such, we will no longer provide earnings per diluted share guidance metrics specific to these items going forward. Let me discuss the outlook for our segments. We continue to be pleased with the growth we're seeing in the US Pharmaceutical segment. The value proposition of our core distribution platform resonates across retail, health systems and provider settings and we anticipate growth across several customer channels. We also anticipate further growth in oncology platform. US Oncology Network, the largest oncology practice management organization in the US has continued to expand its footprint into local communities to increase the availability of advanced care and better patient outcomes. We continue to grow the provider footprint with over 2,300 providers in the network. We formed a joint venture with the Sarah Cannon Research Institute in fiscal 2023. This partnership enhances our proposition at biopharma companies and further advances our differentiated offerings across the entire pharmaceutical lifecycle. Additionally, in fiscal '24, we anticipate branded pharmaceutical price increases to be in line with increases experienced in fiscal 2022. We do not anticipate the higher price increases that we saw in fiscal '23 to repeat in fiscal '24. Within our generics business, the fundamentals remain competitive, yet stable, with our strong sourcing programs continue to provide value for our customers. Wrapping up the US Pharmaceutical segment, for fiscal '24, we anticipate revenue to increase 9% to 11%, and operating profit to be approximately flat to 3% growth year-over-year. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution from fiscal 2023, we anticipate operating profit to increase 5% to 8%. In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we anticipate revenue growth of 7% to 13%, and operating profit growth of 11% to 15%, reflecting continued organic growth and higher transaction volumes across our access and affordability solutions and services. Within the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, our 3PL services typically represent slightly more than half of full year revenues, while the services represented less than 10% of full year operating profit on average over the previous three fiscal years. I've stated previously, the mix of revenue in this segment can vary quarter-to-quarter. However, over the balance of a full year, we anticipate full year product mix in fiscal '24 to be consistent with prior years. In fiscal '23, we also acquired Rx Savings Solutions, which helps employers and health plans reduce prescription drug costs by utilizing its advanced analytics capabilities. We're pleased with this acquisition's progress and we'll continue its integration during fiscal '24, as we begin to realize the value from the synergies. This segment continues to perform well, with higher revenue and margin opportunities that leverage our scale and technology capabilities. The strong growth profile over the last years reflects our ongoing strategic investments to grow and expand our suite of products and solutions to provide next-generation patient access, affordability and adherence solutions that are automated and integrated into provider workflows. In the Medical Surgical Solutions segment, we anticipate reported revenues to be approximately a 1% decline to 3% growth and operating profit to decrease 5% to 11%. The Medical Surgical business remains well positioned to leverage the breadth and depth of its services throughout the alternate site market, including growth in the primary care business and lab solutions. Our contract with the US government for the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies ends in July of 2023. We expect the remaining impact of this contract to be immaterial to fiscal '24 results. And while we anticipate a modest contribution from COVID-19 tests, we anticipate volumes to continue to decline and be at a lower level compared to fiscal '23 and immaterial to fiscal '24 results. Excluding the impact of these COVID-19 related items from fiscal '23 results, we anticipate operating profit to increase 11% to 15% year-over-year. Finally, in the International segment, we anticipate revenues to decline by 30% to 34% and operating profit to decline by 23% to 29%. This year-over-year decrease includes the loss of operating profit contribution from businesses and transactions we've closed to-date and that we expect to close during fiscal '24. We continue to explore strategic alternatives to exit our remaining operations in Norway and as I mentioned on our third quarter earnings call, we intend to deploy capital through share repurchases to offset any dilution resulting from the European divestitures. Now turning to cash flow and capital deployment. Our North American businesses continued to generate strong free cash flow and our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We continue to be focused on profitable growth and efficient deployment of capital. Our 24% return on invested capital illustrates our focus on shareholder value creation. Our strong balance sheet provides us the flexibility to pursue multiple capital allocation priorities concurrently. We will continue to prioritize growth through organic opportunities, however, increasingly through acquisitions that are on-strategy and appropriate multiples. For fiscal '24, we anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion, net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses. We also remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders. Our outlook incorporates plans to repurchase approximately $3.5 billion of shares in fiscal '24. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal '24 to be in the range of approximately $133 million to $134 million. Combining all these elements leads to adjusted earnings per share of $26.10 to $26.90. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related items and the contribution from our remaining European operations in Norway, we anticipate earnings per diluted share growth of approximately 14% to 18% in fiscal '24, which is above the long-term target rate we previously provided. The strong outlook further demonstrates our shareholder value creation framework. We continue to be focused on profitable growth and efficient deployment of capital. Turning now to our long-term adjusted segment operating profit growth targets, which can be found on slide 19. As COVID-19 related contracts with the US government are scheduled to end in July of 2023, and the contribution from Europe continues to run off as guided, we remain committed to executing against our strategic initiatives in building on our differentiated assets and capabilities. As a result, we are pleased to be raising our long-term growth targets, a demonstration of the execution of our strategies, our leading market positions and strong financial position. For US Pharmaceutical, we anticipate 5% to 7% long-term growth, which is up from 4%, Prescription Technology Solutions 11% to 12% long-term growth, up from 11%, and the Medical Surgical Solutions 10% to 12% long-term growth, up from 10%. With our strong underlying momentum and our aligned focus on the many growth opportunities moving forward, I remain confident we'll continue to deliver long-term sustainable growth to provide superior value for our customers, team members and shareholders alike. In conclusion, we are well-positioned in the market with a unique strength and scale that only McKesson can provide. We will continue to invest in our strategies as we expand the reach of our oncology ecosystem and biopharma services platform. As fiscal 2023 demonstrated, our strategies are working, producing value for all stakeholders. We have tremendous momentum across the business, a strong financial outlook, and our financial framework and execution position us to deliver sustainable profit growth, cash flows and shareholder value creation. We have great confidence in our teams and our products and services and in our strategy. With that let me now turn it back over to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Eric Percher with Nephron Research.
Eric Percher: Thanks for all the detail. Thank you. I'd like to dig into the increase in long-term profit growth targets and specifically pharma as a massive absolute number at the high end of the new range, and for '24, that range comes with needing to lap brand benefits. So I'd love to hear what gets you to the high-end of the range factors within the year, and what drives the long-term guidance, macro trend versus strategy versus investment.
Britt Vitalone: Thanks for the question, Eric. I think what. As we look at the business, we've already previously indicated that we thought we could grow the business faster than the originally indicated long-term guidance into a number of factors that are a part of that. First of all, we've seen strong utilization. I think that, as a baseline, we've seen that actually increase throughout the year and we expect that utilization will remain solid going forward. We've built a lot of momentum across our health systems business, our retail pharmacy network and the value that we're providing there. And we've been growing our oncology platform. You heard Brian and I both referenced the number of providers that we've added. Certainly, if you think about the value that we provide, not only as a distributor, but GPO services and now the added capabilities with Ontada and Sarah Cannon Research and the opportunities going forward as it relates to biosimilars, all of these things really point to the opportunities for us to grow faster in the future than the original long-term target rate. And the business continues to generate good cash and efficiency through a scaled operation. So I think all of those things and the momentum that we've showed now over a number of years, leading us to have some confidence in a higher growth target.
Nicole Kramer: Next question please.
Operator: And our next will be Michael Cherny with Bank of America.
Michael Cherny: Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Congratulations on a really strong guide. Maybe to take Eric's question, but titbit a bit onto the MedSurg side. It seems like the multitude of factors you've been backing out COVID has continued to help you strong market positioning, site of care, volumes, you name it. As you think about the build, because you did take up that guidance as well, what do you think the steady state looks like in terms of where we have been pre-COVID versus going forward among all those different metrics, among share gain among site of care, among private label that allows you to build to that higher and consistent double-digit growth rate within what already is a pretty sizable segment from an EBIT perspective?
Brian Tyler: Thanks, Michael. I'll take that one and give Britt a minute of relief. So our medical business is incredibly diverse. I mean, across, it really shows up in all of the alternate sites or everywhere that's not a hospital setting to be truthful. And even amongst hospitals, we tend to serve all of their communities, not all, but we do serve their community-based locations. And then it's also diverse from a sense of multiple product lines, not just commodity medical products, it's equipment, it's lab, it's pharmaceutical, it's specialty pharmaceutical. When we look at utilization broadly across the industry, we've been pleased to see it come back. We've seen prescriptions come back, oncology visits come back. Medical has probably recovered a bit over the course of the last year, but we are encouraged by recent commentary and staff on the recovery and ambulatory surgery centers, for example. So I think there's a big utilization that we think continues to underlie this business. There's the diversity of the products and the new segments that we can penetrate. There's opportunities for us. We continue to believe in our private brand portfolio. So I'd say it's the confluence of all those things that give us the confidence.
Nicole Kramer: Next question, please.
Operator: And next will be Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa Gill: Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Just, Britt, I first wanted to follow up on the $0.40 range as we think of the guidance and just to understand some of the puts and takes and the upper end and the lower end. And more importantly, as we think about, for example, the changes in insulin pricing and how drug distributors make money. So one, can you maybe just walk us through how we should think about insulin? And then secondly, in the answer to an earlier question, you talked about lapping the brand benefit. But I'm also curious as to how you and Brian are thinking about new products that are coming to the market. I think of things like GLP-1s and other really expensive drugs that will have a big top line.
Britt Vitalone: Thanks for the question, Lisa. So a lot there. Let me just see if I can tick through it, and if I miss something, please remind me. As we think about the products that we serve across our biopharma partners, our first job there is to think about what is it that our customers need. And then work with our biopharma partners to determine the services that they need us to provide on behalf of those products. And when we do that, we work to establish a fair value for those services that we provide, regardless of what the product is. That's what we do on a constant basis, working with our manufacturers. So I think we've talked about this now for a number of years that we've continue to evolve our manufacturing relationships and our pricing to be reflective of the fair value of the services that we provide. And as we go forward, that's going to be -- continue to be our focus so that we maintain the economics that we have for the services that we provide. In terms of GLP-1s. Again, it's part of the broad set of products that we distribute on behalf of manufacturers to our customers. One of the other things I would remind you of is, over the last several years, we've been on a journey to ensure that all products, regardless of the category, individually are reflective of the economics that we receive in terms of how we price those back with our customers. So we're on that -- we continue to be on that focus, and I think we're well positioned to do that as we go forward. I don't know, Brian, if you would -- there's anything you would add to that?
Brian Tyler: No. I think that's well done. I mean, obviously, it's hard to go anywhere these days without talking about GLP-1s. And I would just characterize it generally, I think their growth will be positive for us and have a big impact on, hopefully, patients and the health of the country.
Nicole Kramer: Next question, please.
Operator: And next will be Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut: Hi. Good afternoon, guys, and congrats also on the guide. I guess, Britt, as I think about the guidance, obviously, raising your operating income target, you don't have an EPS growth target here in like the last time when you did the Investor Day. So just curious if the bridge to EPS has changed from the operating income targets that you've laid out. Or maybe how should we be thinking about EPS growth? Thanks.
Britt Vitalone : Yes, Brian, thanks for that question. I think what we've done here is we've updated the segments. There really is no change to the range that we provided for adjusted EPS. So one of the comments that I made, as we think about capital deployment, we're going to continue to focus on growing the business, whether that be organically and the investments that we make in it or more as we go forward more on M&A. You saw us do a couple of really key M&A transactions last year that were right on strategy. And as you know, it generally takes a few years to get the full synergies from that M&A. We expect that we'll continue to do M&A on strategy at the right multiples and that even with the increase in the operating segment guidance that overall that the overall EPS guidance would still be within the range. There's opportunities obviously for us, if we're able to generate some more capital deployment and we're able to get some acquisitions here that we can realize the synergies in an earlier manner for us to be at the upper end of the range that we provided you, but really no change to the overall range in this update.
Nicole Kramer: Next question, please.
Operator: And next will be Charles Rhyee with TD Cowen.
Charles Rhyee: Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats as well. I wanted to focus a little bit on -- within the -- going back to the earlier question about the increase in the long-term guide for the US Pharma segment. Can you talk a little bit more about Ontada and sort of the progress you've made there, the increase in guide -- in the long-term guide, would you expect to come from Ontada. And maybe talk a little bit more about what's been going on there? And then -- and I guess is this JV with HCA, the Sarah Cannon Research Institute, is that part of the Ontada sort of partnership or is that separate. Just trying to understand a little bit more where we've gotten to at this point because I know a couple of years ago, when you announced it at the Investor Day, you kind of suggested it was kind of immaterial in the near term, but just trying to see how far we've gone so far.
Brian Tyler: Yes, let me jump in on this one, Britt. So we call it an oncology ecosystem because we really think there is this value of all of the pieces together, and I'm really pleased with the progress that we're making overall. You've seen the growth that both Britt and I talked about in the U.S. Oncology Network now scaled to over 2,300 providers. We've made tremendous progress, had a record year of adding providers to the network last year, and that's a piece. And that, as that grows, that obviously feeds more data, gives us more provider insight. That allows Ontada to continue to work with our partners to create products and services that help them develop, commercialize and get their products to market and understand how to most effectively go to market to have the utilization and patient impact that they want. We think that Ontada is in year three or four of its development, building off some assets that we had long had, but we continue to invest in new product development. And we continue to see that business improve year-over-year. We think the partnership with the joint venture we did for the Sarah Cannon Research Institute, who brings additional insights, moves us up stage into clinical trials in a very prominent way in the community setting. So again we think that trial early insight business, that helps feed Ontada. That helps our providers navigate the clinical care that they have to provide every day. The insights we get from that clinical care can feed back through some of our data assets to provide information back to the biopharma. So each of the pieces is sort of additive to the overall solution. And I'd just say that while we're probably, I would characterize that it's still an investment phase in Ontada because we still believe there's opportunity and a big long-term market out there and lots of space for us to be innovating in with the unique assets we have. Overall, I think it was a -- very pleased with where our oncology business has developed.
Nicole Kramer: Next question, please.
Operator: And next will be Daniel Grosslight with Citi.
Daniel Grosslight: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. If I back out the impact of the divestitures from the international business, it looks like you're growing Canada around 8% to 10% or so, depending on what the Norway contribution is assume this year. Curious what's driving the strength of the Canadian business in '24. And if your international guidance contemplates a full year contribution from Norway?
Brian Tyler: Well, we don't really break out Norway and Canada and talk about them separately. But what I will say about our Canadian business is we have, again, a very diversified set of assets in Canada. We have a leading distribution position. We have a leading retail banner position. We've got a leading chain pharmacy position there. We've got biopharma and specialty assets. Now those work very differently than the ones that work in the US, but really in many ways, getting at kind of the same overall need just in a very different health care system. And so on the basis of our scale and our breadth, we are a really important player in the health of Canada. And I think we've been able to leverage that scale. We're able to find efficiencies across the business to continue to support growth that we're very pleased with.
Britt Vitalone: Maybe I'll just answer the one mechanical question as it relates to Norway. We do have Norway included in our full year FY'24. Just to repeat, though, we continue to strategically look for an opportunity to exit the European operations completely, which would be Norway, but you should anticipate that there's a full year of Norway in our numbers.
Nicole Kramer: Next question, please.
Operator: And next will be George Hill with Deutsche Bank.
George Hill: Hey, good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Brian, I want to come back to one more on oncology. You guys announced a couple of smaller transactions in the prepared commentary and your friends in Philadelphia recently announced a deal. I guess I would ask, as you guys look out from kind of the practice management and partnership perspective, how much greenfield opportunity do you guys see left? And I know that you have the Ontada business that's budding, but would just kind of look how you think about the runway to continue to either work more tightly with practices or help them grow their business, which serves as an opportunity to grow McKesson's business as well. Just trying to figure out what inning we're in there. Thank you.
Brian Tyler: Thanks, George. Thanks for the question. So we've been at this for a long time. I think we acquired US. Oncology in 2010, so it's been a long time. We've got a lot of experience. And if you think about the breadth of our solutions in the community oncology space, I mean, we start with -- you can start your relationship with McKesson with just basic distribution. Then you can add on distribution and our GPO services. And then we have a la carte services to support you in the running of your practice. And that gives us great relationships, great insight into the practices that are out there in the community and helps us really identify who we consider to be the leaders, businesses that are run with similar clinical and operational philosophies to the US Oncology Network. So it's not uncommon to see a start with just a very transactional relationship, but then over time, grow that into inclusion in the US Oncology Network. We have a very disciplined model for the types of practices that we think fit the USAN model. And I think over the last couple of years, you've seen us pretty successfully attract them into the US Oncology Network.
Nicole Kramer: Next question, please.
Operator: And next will be Kevin Caliendo with UBS.
Kevin Caliendo: Hi, thanks for taking my question. It's about the long-range plan. If I'm looking at the Pharma segment, it looks like margins should be flat or maybe up. You have operating income kind of growing in line but yet for fiscal '24, if we back out the COVID benefit, it's below. And -- meaning this margin shrinkage is expected. So I'm just wondering if that's insulin or something else. And then with the long-range plan, is the raising of the long-range plan like from fiscal '24 forward or is it inclusive of what just happened in '23 as well?
Britt Vitalone: So thanks for the question. Let me maybe answer these in reverse order. What we've done here is provide you our FY'24 outlook. And at the same time, looking back at our performance over the previous five years, updating our guidance going forward from fiscal '24 forward as a long-term rate. As we look at the margins year-over-year, I think, there's a few things that will impact us. Clearly, the mix of both products and services that we provide with a heavier and faster-growing specialty product portfolio as well as the mix of customers and continue to see growth -- faster growth in our largest customers. And then the last thing I would say is we are very proud of the oncology business that we're putting together, including our Ontada business and Sarah Cannon Research, and we're continuing to invest in those capabilities and services to support a lot of what Brian just talked about in terms of how we really think about the growth opportunities that we have going forward. So I think those would be the couple of things that I would point out that could lead to margin variation from one year to another.
Nicole Kramer: Next question, please.
Operator: And next will be Steven Valiquette with Barclays.
Steven Valiquette: Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Just on the 340B topic, I think some questions on that as far as exposure for McKesson kind of heading into these results. I guess I'm just curious for fiscal '24 guidance was baked into the outlook for any sort of 340B impact and how that compares to fiscal '23, if that's even material one way or the other? I just wanted to get some color on that. Thanks.
Britt Vitalone: Yes. Mechanically, clearly, we feel like we're well positioned to manage through any impacts that come from 340B. Any impacts that will come from that are assumed within our guidance. There's nothing additional to call out.
Nicole Kramer: Next question, please.
Operator: And next will be Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.
Erin Wright: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Can you comment a little bit on the dynamics of what's driving the strength across the generics program? And is there anything to call out there or changes in fundamentals across the generics business? And have you seen some of the disruption amongst some of the certain larger generic manufacturers flow through to your business? Thanks.
Britt Vitalone: Thanks for the question. So as I talked about a little bit in my remarks, maybe I'll expand on that. We have a very scaled generics operation. We start with a very scaled and efficient sourcing program that we've been running now for a number of years, and we have some great partners. And we have great partnerships with generic manufacturers, very diverse and very broad set of partners. That helps us manage through any supply shocks that may happen and those are -- those happen every year. We're able to manage through that. For as long as I've been in this business, you will see -- from time to time, you will see a generic shortage or a generic impact to supply. We've been able to manage through that very well given the strength and the breadth of partnerships that we have. I also talked about the fact that the marketplace has very stable fundamentals. So when you think about our -- the focus that we have on a scaled and efficient sourcing program, stable set of market fundamentals, which, again, are very competitive environment, but a stable environment and our focus that we have on the sell side with our customers, and we've been able to manage very effectively through this. Our focus is to provide low cost, high availability of supply to our customers. That is really the bedrock of the success that we have with our generics program. I think we've been able to do that quite well for a number of years.
Nicole Kramer: Next question, please.
Operator: And next will be Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys. Thanks for much for the question. Two questions for me. One is on the -- obviously, you had some changes and cost cutting on the OpEx line, so in the fourth quarter. How do you see sort of any potential pacing of that impacting the fourth quarter? And secondly, can you talk a little bit maybe more specifically about sort of what you have embedded in the 2024 guidance for biosimilars versus the longer-term plan? Thank you very much.
Britt Vitalone: Sure. Thanks for the question. So as I talked about, we enacted a set of initiatives, and we recorded a charge for restructuring that was primarily in our US pharmaceutical and prescription technology business. We expect that those initiatives and activities will be complete by the end of fiscal 2024. So I think that would answer your question on that. And from a biosimilars perspective, we continue to believe that there's great opportunity here as we continue to add providers to the network that provides more opportunity for us. And we think we're very well positioned and we've certainly embedded the opportunity within the guidance that we provided you today.
Brian Tyler: Yes. What we know is in, obviously, 40 approvals, 27 launched. A big event this year will be Humira, which is going to be a Part D product, not Part B. We have many more services to offer and assets to leverage and use in the Part B arena. So we will track kind of payer response and pricing strategies and patient adoption over the course of this year. But what we know is baked into the guidance, we've provided.
Nicole Kramer: Operator, we have time for one more final question.
Operator: Certainly. That question will come from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.
A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Thanks for the question. In the prepared remarks, and maybe this is what you're just touching on a little bit, but you mentioned reprioritizing some investments in the Prescription Technology Solutions business. I wonder if there was any way to flesh out a little bit more about what specifically you're doing there. And when I look at your '24 guidance, it actually looks like you're assuming the Prescription Technology Solutions grows faster, 11% to 15% versus your updated 11% to 12% long-term target. And I wonder what was driving that.
Brian Tyler: Well, I mean, if you think about this business, I mean, first off, we've had really strong growth the last several years. We actually combine and form this business a couple of years ago, just a couple of years ago by bringing various businesses and assets across the company together. And as those things continue to come together, we continue to look at our resources, our product offerings. We have conversations with manufacturers about their life cycle and service needs across that life cycle. And we just felt like, as we evaluated investments we had been making and where we thought investment opportunities were for the future, it just made sense for efficiency and focus purposes to make sure we align those to where our best possibilities are. When you make those realignments, the skill set is not always the same, what you're moving from to what you're moving to. And so unfortunately, that did impact some of our teammates. This is our job. This is one of our strategy, to simplify the portfolio and be focused on efficiency and positioning the business for long-term growth. So we feel very good about the performance this past fiscal year and feel good about the targets we have set for fiscal '24.
Britt Vitalone: And I guess I would just remind you, again, these are long-term target rates that we expect that we'll be able to achieve. And as this business is broad and diverse, and we have it as a strategic focus point, we're going to continue to invest in this business from year-to-year that may vary. But over the long-term, we feel comfortable with the updated guidance that we've given you, but it's a business that we're going to continue to make investments and to grow it and to support our customers.
Brian Tyler: Okay. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon or evening, depending on where you are. I appreciate all the thoughtful questions, your support and interest in McKesson. Thank you, Rachel for facilitating this call. I want to conclude by just stating McKesson had a strong fourth quarter and full year results. I am really pleased with the continued momentum in the business. Britt and I remain confident in our ability to deliver sustainable long-term growth. I want to end though, with a note of acknowledgment to the McKesson employees. It's really thanks to their dedication and their commitment to our customers, our partners and to each other that enable us to truly improve care in every setting, one product, one partner, and one patient at a time. Thank you, Team McKesson. Everyone else thanks again for joining. Have a terrific evening.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-02-01 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to McKesson's Third Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Rachel Rodriguez: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone, to McKesson's Third Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements such as forecasts about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com and to the Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Information about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results can be found in today's earnings release and presentation slides. The presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and updated guidance assumptions.  With that, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Rachel, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call this afternoon. Today, we reported third quarter fiscal 2023 results, another quarter with solid adjusted operating profit growth, underscoring the significant progress we continue to make in our company in terms of our overall company priorities. It also signals the continued strength and stability of our North American businesses.  As a result of our third quarter performance and business outlook, we are raising our guidance range for fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per diluted share from $24.45 to $24.95 to an updated range of $25.75 to $26.15. During today's call, I'm going to highlight the progress we've made across our four strategic priorities. Then I'll ask Britt to provide additional details on the financial performance in our third quarter. As you know, a few years ago, we crafted our enterprise strategy and we shared our priorities with our stakeholders.  We are evolving our portfolio of capabilities, and we have divested businesses that are not aligned with our strategy. And we have invested both organically and through acquisitions to add to our differentiated capabilities. We're increasing our focus on the areas where we have deep expertise and that are central to our long-term growth strategy. Our progress to date is underpinned by the execution against these important company priorities a focus on people and culture, intentional efforts to evolve and grow our portfolio of capabilities, to advance and expand our differentiated oncology ecosystem and our biopharma services platform and our commitment towards sustainable core growth.  The strength of our core distribution businesses continued to show solid growth and generate free cash flow, which provides us a strong balance sheet and the ability to invest internally and externally into the business. I'll start with our first priority, our focus on people and culture. Embedded in our daily operations is our purpose, advancing health outcomes for all. McKesson is an impact-driven organization. We recognize that giving back to the community is important to our associates, and we continue to provide engaging and, most importantly, impactful ways for Team McKesson to do exactly that.  In the third quarter, we had another successful Community Impact Day, where nearly 13,000 members of Team McKesson across North America volunteered to support nonprofits that provide food to people facing hunger. McKesson also held its annual Giving Tuesday, where Team McKesson's generosity resulted in $1.5 million in employee donations, with a portion of that matched by the McKesson Foundation, which will ultimately be distributed to 1,500 local, national and global charities.  In addition to the progress made by our employees, the McKesson Foundation donated more than $4 million to pharmacy schools to help increase workforce diversity and improve overall health outcomes for vulnerable populations. These grants, which range from one to five years in duration, will support various pharmacy school education and community outreach programs. The innovative student support, professional development and community outreach that the McKesson Foundation is funding through these pharmacy school partnerships will help transform patient-pharmacist interactions, which we believe will lead to improved health equity and patient outcomes for vulnerable populations in their respective areas. I'm proud of our talented team as their dedication, hard work and innovation enables our business to positively impact our partners, our customers and our communities. Our next priority is to evolve and grow the portfolio. We have continued to evolve and grow our capabilities, ensuring that our capital deployment is tightly aligned with where we have the best growth opportunities. This led us to our decision to exit the European region as well as a handful of smaller businesses over the last several years.  We're progressing on our plans to exit the European region and have successfully exited 11 of the 12 countries we operated in. We remain committed to exploring strategic alternatives for our business in Norway, which is the only country we have not yet divested.  These actions allow us to focus our resources on areas that support our long-term strategy. It's provided us additional flexibility to invest internally or to look externally to expand our oncology and our biopharma ecosystems, which aligns well with our next company priority. We have made meaningful progress expanding our oncology and biopharma ecosystems as exemplified by the strategic investments made year-to-date. McKesson recently announced that The US Oncology Network, the U.S.'s largest oncology practice management organization, has continued to expand its geographic footprint with the addition of two new practices, Epic Care in California and Nexus Health in New Mexico. Both are now part of The US Oncology Network as of January 1, 2023. These practices offer a wide range of specialties, enabling more comprehensive care that helps ensure patients can conveniently receive the care they need in their local communities during their entire treatment and healing journey. And we're excited by the new opportunities that our joint venture with Sarah Cannon Research Institute as well as the acquisition of Genospace bring to our overall oncology ecosystem. I'm pleased with the substantial progress we've made in the development and expansion of our oncology ecosystem.  This progress supports the solid performance of the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment as we further our long-term growth strategies. We will continue to evaluate internal and external opportunities to invest, to grow and to evolve this business. In addition to our oncology assets and capabilities, our biopharma services platform remains another priority area of growth. Over the last several years, we've systematically built and acquired an ecosystem of assets that complement on each -- that complement each other and are more valuable together than as separate stand-alone solutions.  Together, these assets leverage our network reach, technology and clinical expertise to enable better access and affordability of medications, which ultimately improves patient outcomes and impacts real lives. We started building this business in 2006 with the acquisition of RelayHealth, which gave us connectivity to over 50,000 pharmacies. We've been able to integrate value-added services right into the workflow so that we can help their processes be more seamless and give the customer the experience they need and deserve.  We then acquired CoverMyMeds, a long-term partner of McKesson in 2017. This expanded our network by providing connectivity with over 750,000 providers. The integration of CoverMyMeds' automation solution alleviates some of the friction out of the workflow providers, improving overall access for the patient. RxCrossroads brought a scale in the business that we already had, a hub services and patient support program, and they expanded our clinical expertise across many new therapeutic areas. In 2020, recall, we brought these businesses together as prescription technology solutions so we can migrate from providing individual offerings to a more comprehensive end-to-end suite of solutions. This enabled us to enhance our value proposition and to help find and get patients started on appropriate therapy more quickly. Most recently, we acquired Rx Savings Solutions, which helps employers and health plans reduce prescription drug costs by utilizing its advanced analytics capabilities. It's more than just price transparency. It really gives members insight and actionable guidance that can drive savings and improve health outcomes for patients.  So, by bringing these businesses together, Relay, CoverMyMeds, RxCrossroads, Rx Savings Solutions, our McKesson prescription technology solutions connect pharmacies, providers, payers and biopharma manufacturers for really next-generation patient access, affordability and adherence solutions that are automated and integrated into provider workflows. CoverMyMeds now processes approximately 21 billion pharmacy transactions annually on behalf of patients to support medication access and affordability. We continue to build and invest in innovative products that allow McKesson to provide unique insights and capabilities to our customers.  And these investment dollars are reflected in our results in the segment year-to-date as well as in our fiscal 2023 outlook. During the third quarter, we continued to organically invest in this segment as we position our products and services for sustainable long-term growth. The investments have enabled us to expand the network and connectivity, develop new solutions and meet the growing demands of our customers. While we continue to invest and grow the platform, we're also always assessing opportunities to evolve and streamline the portfolio to ensure our resources and investments are focused on the products that bring the most value to patients.  This business saw substantial momentum coming out of COVID-19 pandemic as our biopharma manufacturers continued to bring more brands to our platform and prescription utilization trends continued to improve. These factors led to strong adjusted operating profit growth in this segment in recent fiscal years. We remain confident in the overall trajectory in this segment and our financial target of 11% growth. And we will continue to reinvest profit into this business to accelerate this business over the long term. The investments made in our oncology and biopharma ecosystems have been possible largely due to the long-standing growth in our sustainable core distribution businesses, which are our fourth company priority.  As we exit the European region, we've been able to focus our efforts on our North American businesses. Our teams are continuously evaluating how to drive efficiencies in our core operations. Whether that's leveraging a more modernized platform, it allows us to act with more speed and agility or ensuring we have the optimal talent and resources to help these businesses succeed. The fundamentals of our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical Solutions segment remains strong. The work that Team McKesson has done to streamline process and efficiencies, combined with positive prescription volume and patient utilization trends, reinforces our confidence in our long-term growth for our North American distribution businesses. In the U.S. Pharmaceutical business, I'm excited to announce that our contract to extend our pharmaceutical distribution partnership with CVS Health through June of 2027 has been finalized. Our long-standing partnership with CVS further exemplifies the value of our scaled distribution capabilities.  The performance of the core operations in our North American distribution business enables strong cash flow generation that's allowed McKesson to continue to innovate and become a leading diversified health care services company. We believe we've made significant strides against our strategic priorities to focus on our people and culture, to grow and evolve the business, to invest in our oncology and biopharma services ecosystem underpinned by the sustainable core growth in our distribution businesses. Let me shift gears just a bit. McKesson has also made progress recently to address environmental sustainability. In January, McKesson received approval by the Science Based Targets initiative for its near-term climate change targets that contribute to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions.  Our SBTi target serves as another example of our commitment to sustainability and our response to climate change. We look forward to leveraging the advancements in climate related technologies that will address these environmental challenges while also enhancing our business and helping to fulfill our company purpose of advancing health outcomes for all. We will, of course, continue to provide updates on our progress to stakeholders on these targets as well as our ongoing ESG-related initiatives on future calls. As an organization, we're also committed to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion. McKesson was recently recognized by Newsweek as one of America's greatest workplaces for diversity in 2023. We're quite honored that Newsweek recognizes McKesson's ongoing efforts to be a more diverse and inclusive employer. All right, let me wrap things up. We are pleased with our solid results in the third quarter as we delivered on our growth strategy and as a diversified health care services company. McKesson's talented employees continue to demonstrate exceptional performance, and our third quarter results reflect their dedication and our execution together as a team in a dynamic operating environment. It also highlights the resiliency of our portfolio of businesses and solutions. Thank you all for your time. With that, Britt, I'm going to toss it over to you for additional comments on the financial results.
Britt Vitalone: Well, thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Our solid fiscal third quarter financial results reflect continued strong execution and momentum, advancing our company priorities. In the fiscal third quarter, we delivered solid growth across our North American segment, led by strong performance in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical Solutions segments.  And we continue to evolve and grow our diversified portfolio through focused and strategic investments in oncology and biopharma services. As a result of our solid financial performance and confidence in the underlying business, we are increasing and narrowing our full year outlook for fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per diluted share to a range of $25.75 to $26.15. Before I provide more details on our third quarter fiscal 2023 non-GAAP adjusted results, I want to point out two items that impacted our GAAP-only results in the quarter. First, we received proceeds of $129 million related to our share of an antitrust class action settlement. We recognized the gain within cost of sales in the third quarter. And second, we recognized a pretax gain of $97 million from the termination of fixed interest rate swaps. This gain is included under other income in the third quarter. Let's move now to a review of our third quarter non-GAAP adjusted results on a year-over-year basis. Consolidated revenues of $70.5 billion increased 3%, driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment resulted from increased specialty product volumes, including retail national account customers, partially offset by lower revenues in the International segment, resulting from the completed divestitures of McKesson's European businesses. Excluding the impact of our European business operations, including completed divestitures, revenues increased 11%. Gross profit was $3 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 10%. Excluding the impact of our European business operations and completed divestitures, gross profit increased 7%, primarily a result of growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. Operating expenses in the quarter decreased 14%, largely driven by completed European divestitures in the International segment. Excluding the impact of our European business operations, including the completed divestitures, operating expenses increased 9%. Operating profit was $1.4 billion, an increase of 9%, driven by a pretax benefit of $126 million related to the early termination of a tax receivable agreement, or TRA, with Change Healthcare and due to growth across North American businesses led by the strong performance in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment.  As a reminder, McKesson was a party to a TRA entered as part of the formation of the joint venture with Change Healthcare. Under the terms of the TRA, Change was generally required to pay McKesson a portion of net tax savings resulting from amortization by the joint venture.  In October of 2022, Change exercised its right to terminate the agreement and paid McKesson $126 million. Consistent with our prior practice recognizing similar items, this benefit is reflected in other income in both our GAAP and adjusted operating results in the quarter. Moving below the line, interest expense increased to $69 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher interest rates and unfavorable impacts in our derivative portfolio as we exit the European region. And the effective tax rate was 23.4% for the quarter. As a reminder, our effective tax rate can vary quarter-to-quarter, driven by our mix of income and the timing of discrete tax items. For the full year, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate in the range of 18% to 20%. Wrapping up our consolidated results. Third quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was approximately 141 million, a decrease of 8%, resulting from share repurchase activity. Overall, third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $6.90, an increase of 12% compared to the prior year. When excluding the impacts from COVID-19-related items and the benefit from the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change, adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 6%. Moving now to our third quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 7 through 12 and starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical, where revenues were $61.9 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year, resulting from increased volume of specialty products, including higher volumes from retail national account customers, branded pharmaceutical price increases and strength in oncology, which included increased patient visits, partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Operating profit increased 6% to $778 million. Our contract with U.S. government for COVID-19 vaccine distribution provided a benefit of approximately $0.25 per share in the quarter compared to $0.26 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution, U.S. Pharmaceutical segment delivered operating profit growth of 7%, driven by growth in distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems, contributions from our generics programs, and improvements in pharmaceutical prescription volumes and oncology visits. In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, revenues were $1.1 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year, driven by increased prescription volumes, faster growth in our third-party logistics business and higher technology service revenues. Operating profit increased 7% to $155 million, driven by growth in access affordability and adherence solutions, partially offset by continued organic investments as we position our products and services for sustainable long-term growth. Next, moving on to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $3 billion, a decrease of 3%. Lower volumes of COVID-19 tests and kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program partially offset the growth in the Primary Care business.  Operating profit increased 2% to $336 million. The contribution from COVID-19 tests and our contract with the U.S. government for the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies provided a total benefit of approximately $0.38 per share in the quarter as compared to $0.57 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Excluding the impact of COVID-related items, the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment delivered operating profit growth of 25%, driven by growth in the Primary Care business and favorable sourcing activities, which partially offset lower volumes of COVID-19 tests and lower contribution from kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies from the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program. Next, let me address our International results. revenues were $4.4 billion, and operating profit was $143 million, a decrease of 36%. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues were $4.9 billion, a decrease of 48%, and operating profit was $158 million, a decrease of 29%. Third quarter results reflect the year-over-year effect from the divestiture of the European businesses. Moving next to corporate. Corporate expenses were $19 million, a decrease of 88% year-over-year, driven by the early termination of a tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare and lower opioid-related litigation expenses. Excluding the benefit from the early termination of the tax receivable agreement, corporate expenses decreased 9%. Additionally, we incurred opioid-related litigation expenses of $9 million in the third quarter, and we anticipate that fiscal 2023 opioid-related litigation expenses will be approximately $50 million. Turning now to our cash position, which can be found on Slide 13. As a reminder, our cash position, working capital metrics and resulting cash flows can each be impacted by timing and vary from quarter-to-quarter. We ended the quarter with $2.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents.  During the first nine months of the fiscal year, we made $376 million of capital expenditures, which includes investments in distribution center capacity, automation and regulatory enhancements and investments in technology, data and analytics to support our growth priorities, including our oncology and biopharma services ecosystems. For the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and 2022, we had free cash flow of $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. During the quarter, we allocated $833 million towards M&A activities, including a joint venture with the Sarah Cannon Research Institute and the acquisition of Rx Savings Solutions.  We also returned $2.1 billion to shareholders, including $2 billion of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we returned $3.7 billion of cash to shareholders, which included $3.5 billion of share repurchases and $216 million in dividend payments. At the end of our fiscal third quarter, we had $3.8 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Let me turn to our fiscal 2023 outlook. A full list of our assumptions can be found on Slides 15 through 18 in our supplemental slide presentation. And I'll begin with our consolidated outlook. Our revised guidance assumes 3% to 7% revenue growth and 2% to 6% operating profit growth as compared to fiscal 2022.  Our guidance includes $2.30 to $2.50 of contribution attributable to the following four items: $0.70 to $0.80 related to the U.S. government's vaccine distribution in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment; $1.10 to $1.20 related to COVID-19 tests and the kitting storage and distribution ancillary supplies in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment; approximately $0.15 related to year-to-date net losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments; and a $0.65 benefit related to the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare.  As a reminder, our contracts with the U.S. government for the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies extends through July of 2023. We anticipate corporate expenses in the range of $435 million to $475 million, which includes net losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments, which we recorded in the first three quarters of the fiscal year, and the benefit from the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare, which was recognized in the third quarter. As a reminder, our practice has been and will continue to not include McKesson Ventures portfolio estimates in our guidance. When excluding the impacts from COVID-19-related items, net gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments and the benefit from the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare, we anticipate operating profit to increase 7% to 11%, above the previous operating profit growth target. Moving below the line, we anticipate interest expense to be in the range of $245 million to $255 million. The increase compared to the prior guidance reflects the higher interest rate environment. Our anticipated full year effective tax rate of approximately 18%, 20% remains unchanged. Based on our third quarter results and our outlook for the fiscal year, we're increasing and narrowing our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share to $25.75 to $26.15 from the previous range of $24.45 to $24.95. When excluding the impacts of COVID-19-related items, net gains and losses from McKesson Ventures equity investments for both fiscal 2023 guidance and fiscal 2022 results and the fiscal 2022 benefit from the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare, our adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance indicates approximately 13% to 16% growth over the prior year. Moving now to the segment outlook for fiscal 2023. In the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, we anticipate reported revenue to increase 12% to 15% and operating profit to increase 5% to 8%. As I outlined earlier, our outlook includes approximately $0.70 to $0.80 related to COVID-19 vaccine distribution for the U.S. government.  When excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution for the U.S. government, we anticipate 7% to 9% operating profit growth. We are pleased with the momentum of the segment. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution business continues to deliver stable growth through focused execution and operational excellence. Let me highlight a few of the factors that are leading to the strong segment performance. First, we've observed stable prescription utilization growth, which underpins the momentum in our health system and retail offerings. Second, we maintain a favorable outlook for our oncology platform, which we see delivering higher growth and higher margin contributions.  We continue to execute and invest against our oncology strategy. As Brian touched on earlier, we continue to add practices and providers to our scale and growing US Oncology network, and we are well positioned to capture increased oncology volumes. Third, we have a scaled an efficient generic sourcing operation, delivering stability of supply and low-cost products for our customers and patients. And specific to fiscal 2023, through the month of January, we observed branded pharmaceutical pricing that was modestly above our expectations.  While fiscal 2023 results benefit from this modest increase, I would make the following two comments: first, the impact from higher branded pharmaceutical pricing remains less material now than historically, as more than 95% of our manufactured contracts are now on a fixed fee-for-service arrangement; and second, we would not anticipate this modest benefit to repeat in future years. Our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment is well positioned and has exhibited strong performance, leading to the increased fiscal 2023 growth outlook. As a result of our execution and the factors that I just noted, we anticipate that this segment will now grow above the 4% earnings growth target rate that we previously provided, including at our 2021 Investor Day. The products and services within the Prescription Technology Solutions segment delivered differentiated access adherence and affordability products. We are pleased with the solid growth in both revenue and operating profit this quarter. Biopharma Services remain an important strategic growth and investment area for McKesson. We're confident this segment will exhibit faster growth and higher margin. We remain confident in our differentiated assets and capabilities. We have unmatched scale across transactions, provider and retail connectivity and product breadth. Our commitment to this segment is evidenced by the investments that we have made. Over the past three years, on average, we've organically invested approximately $100 million a year into new and existing products and services. And the recent acquisition of Arc Statement Solutions will accelerate the breadth of capabilities we continue to build out.  We also anticipate further organic investments in new capabilities as well as more M&A. The internal investment pattern, the mix of technology products and third-party logistics services and the life cycle of the products we serve, including the timing of launches, have resulted in variability in performance quarter-to-quarter. As we continue to invest and grow the business, we anticipate that there could be charges to further integrate product portfolios and supporting infrastructure. We anticipate delivering revenue growth of 10% to 16% and operating profit growth of 14% to 17%, which is in line with the 14% to 20% initial guidance that we communicated on our May 2022 earnings call and above the operating profit growth target of 11% provided at our Investor Day event in 2021. We are well positioned for strong growth, and we're committed to the operating growth targets that we've previously communicated. In the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, we anticipate reported revenues to decrease 1% to 5% and operating profit to decrease 1% to 4%. As previously mentioned, our outlook includes approximately $1.10 to $1.20 related to COVID-19 tests and the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related items, we anticipate Medical-Surgical operating profit to increase 12% to 15%. Finally, in the International segment, we anticipate revenues to decline by 42% to 46% and operating profit to decline by 26% to 29%. This year-over-year decrease includes the loss of operating profit contribution from businesses and transactions that we have closed to date. For fiscal 2023, we anticipate our European operations will contribute operating profit of approximately $0.90 to $0.95 per diluted share, primarily in the first nine months of the fiscal year. This includes year-to-date contributions from operations prior to completed sales, our operations in Norway and the contribution resulting for held-for-sale accounting for the transaction with PHOENIX Group. Let me conclude our outlook with a review of cash flow and capital deployment. We continue to anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses. In fiscal 2023, our cash flows have also been impacted by European divestiture activities and other transactions. As discussed last quarter, our free cash flow guidance includes approximately $900 million of negative impacts from our European operations and divested assets. We remain committed to be good stewards of capital for our shareholders. We have and will continue to take a disciplined approach to capital allocation. We strategically think about capital allocation in three broad categories. First, we prioritize growth by investing internally and through M&A. We are focused on accelerating our strategic growth pillars of oncology and biopharma services. These growth platforms have differentiated asset scale and network capabilities. Next, we will continue to return capital to shareholders through a combination of our growing dividend and share repurchases. And the third piece of our framework is a strong balance sheet and adequate liquidity underpinned by the maintenance of an investment-grade credit rating.  Our outlook continues to incorporate plans to repurchase approximately $3.5 billion of shares, which has been largely completed by the end of our fiscal third quarter. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $142 million. Let me take a moment and reflect on the fiscal 2023 outlook and our growth targets. At our 2021 Investor Day event, we shared with you a set of growth metrics that reflect our commitment to drive continued momentum across the business segments. Since then, we've executed on our strategy and delivered operating profit growth consistently at or above the targets that we communicated on a consolidated and on a segment level. Some of the business dynamics that we outlined previously have materialized as tailwinds and contributed to recent growth, including growth in prescription volume and patient mobility, our ability to grow through macroeconomic unpredictability and successful execution on a disciplined capital deployment strategy that focuses on growth and maximizing shareholder return.  More importantly, the solid performance is further demonstration of our shareholder value creation framework. We continue to be focused on profitable growth and efficient deployment of capital. Our 24% return on invested capital illustrates our focus on shareholder value creation. In closing, we are pleased with the results of our fiscal third quarter. We continued to deliver solid operating results through focused execution and strategic investment. Looking ahead, we're confident in our ability to deliver sustainable long-term growth. Our disciplined growth strategy and financial framework give us the confidence we will deliver on our operating profit growth targets.  Thank you. And now with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Michael Cherny with Bank of America.
Michael Cherny: Thanks for everyone. Diving into the Prescription Technology Solutions business a bit, I know it continues to evolve in terms of the assets that you've put in place, continued organic investment you make. As you think about the ability to continue on sustain the pathway of your long-term growth targets, how much are you working on in terms of the dynamics of visibility within your own business, not just to the Street, but ensuring that on a quarter-by-quarter basis, some of the, I guess, I'd call it, lumpiness that we've seen in the last couple of quarters can smooth itself out. And how will this business evolve on that front in terms of that level of visibility and your ability to continue to convert successful sales, successful organic investment into the sustained long-term growth rate.
Brian Tyler: Great question. I'll let me kick it off first. I'd say we continue to be pleased with the performance of this business. And we've got revenue growth of 9% year-over-year, AOP growth of 7% this year. Last two years have been particularly strong for this business. And what you find is as you continue to add capabilities into this business, we find opportunities for new ideas, new invention, reinvention, sometimes reprioritization of the projects. But we shared at Investor Day, we think this is a $15 billion-plus market opportunity in access affordability and adherence. And we see a relatively long runway and we feel pretty confident in our 11% target growth for this segment. Now there are things that naturally happen in this business that may make it. I think your word was lumpy. Maybe that was our word. It became your word. Things like the recovery pace of underlying prescription volumes. The commercial success of some of the projects we partner with as they underachieve or overachieve their expectations, loss of exclusivity events. Our investments, I mean, we've made significant investments in this business over the last three years. We see continued opportunity to do that and that's not always completely smooth. I mean, the nature of those opportunities is going to be variable.  Our process is to make sure that we've got disciplined line of sight, financial expectations and that those are prudent and good investments to make to sustain the growth in this segment long term.
Britt Vitalone: And Mike, maybe what I would add is while we have seen a little bit of variability quarter-to-quarter, one of the things that is just inherent in this business and we talked about this is the annual customer verification process that we do for a lot of our customers, and that usually happens in the fourth quarter.  What I would say, though, is that what we are pleased with, if you go back to the guidance that we gave you at the beginning of the year in May, 14% to 20%. The guidance that we're giving you now to finish the year is really within the balance of that guidance. It's been, as I said, a little bit of variable quarter-to-quarter, but it's really in line with the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year. And we're really pleased that while we've been investing in this business, both organically and through M&A, that we're seeing this business develop above the long-term target rates that we gave you at Investor Day.  So while we've seen a little bit of -- a little more variability this year quarter-to-quarter than we may have seen historically, when you look at it on an annual basis and you look at it over the long term, which is how we manage the business, we're seeing this above the long-term target rates that we gave and really in line with the initial guidance we gave at the beginning of the year.
Operator: And next will be Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa Gill: Good afternoon everyone. I hope everyone is safe in Texas. Just wanted to go back to a couple of comments that you made around U.S. drug distribution. One would be the renewal with CBS through 2027. Just want to understand if there's anything new or nuance to that relationship? And then secondly, as we think about oncology within U.S. drug distribution, Britt, I don't know if it was you or Brian that made the comment that you're going to see higher growth and higher margin there. At what point does that become big enough that, that actually drives the margin? Or is that part of what we're seeing in the margin improvement today? Just any kind of guardrails you could give us around how to think about that on a go-forward basis as that business continues to grow.
Brian Tyler: Sure. Look, we were obviously -- I think last quarter, we shared we had a binding LOI with CVS. We've just finalized that contract work, Lisa. We've been partnering with CVS for a long time. We're incredibly proud to support the work they do and be affiliated with them. I would not say that the services that we're providing has materially changed. And so, we're thrilled to have the opportunity to extend that to 2027. In terms of oncology, I mean, we call it an ecosystem because we think it all sort of reinforces each other. So, as we do things like bring practices into the network, that gives us more access to data, which supports oncology. It gives us more purchasing power and it supports our GPO business.  And so, we've been really pleased with the progression in the oncology business and our ability to scale out in each of those dimensions. But each piece does help to reinforce the other piece. And we continue to think oncology is a very large market opportunity, in excess of $50 billion, and that we have the assets that position us quite well to succeed in the long term here.
Britt Vitalone: And Lisa, maybe what I would add, what we've done over the last year or two through the development of Ontada, through the partnerships with Sarah Cannon Research Institute and Genospace, we're moving up the value chain. And so, we're leveraging the scale that we have in The US Oncology Network, the distribution scale, the GPO scale that Brian just talked about. We're adding more practices as Brian referenced earlier. And by moving up the value chain with more scale, we're very optimistic that, that's going to add to margin over the coming years.
Operator: And next will be Eric Percher with Nephron Research.
Eric Percher: Thank you. I appreciate the commentary on fiscal year '23 relative to long-term guidance targets. I believe last year at this time, you provided a little bit of forward commentary in advance, the formal guidance on the factors that might be worth keeping in mind as we all model fiscal year '24. What would you call out relative to those items that have been helping '23 and may or may not drive you above/below long-term guidance next year?
Britt Vitalone: Thanks for the question, Eric. I tried to address a little of that in my comments but maybe I can capture it here. I think there's really a handful of items that we think could be impactful as we go forward. Clearly, we talked about the stabilization of prescription transactions and patient mobility and utilization seems to be quite stable. We saw prescription volume growth of about -- roughly about 5% in our third quarter, so that seems to be in line with what we've seen in the last few quarters. Certainly, biosimilar acceleration. We're going to see more biosimilars coming to market. We've got just over two dozen that are on the market today and more are coming. Some recent announcements certainly back that up. I'd say the timing and size of the growth investments that we make and really the timing of our integration, some of the acquisitions that we made, we think could be very impactful in a positive way. And then I think there are a handful of other items. The trajectory of COVID, we think that, that's going to go into the commercial pipeline here in 2023. Our contract goes through July of 2023. It doesn't mean that those services and products are going to go away.  So, the pace and trajectory of that will certainly be impactful. And we have a very strong balance sheet. We expect to continue to deploy that balance sheet in a very capital-accretive way, whether that's returning to shareholders or, as you've seen us do here recently, more towards acquisitions that are right on strategy. And clearly, we had the opportunity to invest organically as well. So, there's a lot of really positive things that are going on. There are some things that could go the other way in terms of trajectory of COVID as an example. But we feel like we're really well positioned against all of those items.
Brian Tyler: Yes. I mean, the macro backdrop remains a bit dynamic, right? We've got China open, China closed, inflation, obviously, workforce dynamics we've dealt with. We've successfully, I think, contemplated that in our FY '23 guidance. Did not really assume any material impact and I think it's played out that way, and we'll be thoughtful about those as we go into '24 as well.
Operator: And next will be Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Charles your line is open.
Charles Rhyee: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to touch a little bit on the Medical segment. Obviously, if we back out COVID, very strong growth here. And just wanted to dig a little deep to understand what's driving it? I know you mentioned the Primary Care business. But maybe you can go a little deeper into that. Is that a -- is there any changes in product mix? Or is this -- because I don't think its probably volume growth per se, but I think about your customers and their growth or new customer wins. Anything that you can kind of call out there would be helpful. And because the 25 obviously, is higher than the full year. And how should we think about that, maybe to Eric's question earlier, about thinking about '24 as well.
Brian Tyler: Go ahead, Britt, you want to take it?
Britt Vitalone: Yes. I would say that in the quarter, we identified that we had some strength in some of our sourcing programs, and that's really what drove above the trend that we've been seeing for the last really several years now. At our Investor Day, we talked about a long-term target rate of around 10%. We certainly are growing a little bit faster than that this year. Certainly, the volumes have been strong. And obviously, the sourcing programs were really a good contributor in the quarter. I think as you think about going forward, clearly, we've given the guidance for '23. But I would anchor you around the long-term growth rates that we've seen now really for the last three to four years. Those are good growth rates. They are good margins within this business. And we think that the Primary Care business is really going to be supportive of that 10% growth rate going forward.
Operator: And the next question will be from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank.
George Hill: Thanks for taking my question. Britt, I'm going to ask you to double check my math on this, which is if I look at your guidance for the Pharma segment for the full year, you're basically -- you have it growing 200 basis points faster for the balance of the year ex COVID, which I assume if I annualize, is going to look like something greater than 6% versus preliminary expectations or at least going into the quarter. I guess, could you talk about what's driving that at the core? And can we think about kind of the sustainability of the pockets of strength you're seeing in that business? Thank you.
Britt Vitalone: Yes. Thanks, George. So, we did raise the guidance for the full year to 7% to 9%, excluding COVID-related items, and we're very pleased with the performance of the segment. As I talked about in my comments, there's really a number of factors here. We've got stable prescription utilization. As I mentioned, we saw -- we're seeing about 5% based on IQVIA data in the third quarter. We're certainly seeing strength in our oncology platform. I think we just talked about some of the factors that are driving that. We're adding practices and we're certainly moving up the value chain from that perspective. And we're seeing growth, really stable growth in specialty providers as well as in health systems. And so, all of those things are performing quite well. And that's also why I talked about that we're expecting now that we're going to grow faster than long-term target growth rate that we gave you at Investor Day and that we've reaffirmed in previous quarters. So, I think all of those things are really positive contributors. And that's why we're seeing faster growth than we would expect, faster than the 4% long-term target growth rate that we gave you previously.
Operator: And next will be Steven Valiquette with Barclays.
Steven Valiquette: Good afternoon. And thanks for taking my question. I guess, separate from all of the helpful color around the COVID profit streams, are you able to comment just on how much flu may have been a key factor in the earnings upside in the quarter, either in the Pharma segment or the Medical segment? Thank you.
Britt Vitalone: As we've talked about previously, this has been a stronger flu season that we've seen historically. It really started in our first quarter. We talked about in our first quarter that there was an extension of the illness season from our fiscal 2022. It's not a material driver to the enterprise. It certainly does drive more visits. We're seeing that the illness season is driving not only vaccines and test flu test kits but also some combo kits, which is -- which started last year.  So, it's not a material driver to the enterprise. It certainly does drive more foot traffic and that certainly is beneficial to other products and services that we have, not only in Medical but in Pharma.
Operator: And next question will be from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut: Thank you, guys. I guess just to follow up on Lisa's question and Britt's comments on the oncology side. It sounds like you guys are looking to get more aggressive with the roll-up of Oncology Networks, and it seems like there's consolidation there.  So, as I think of catalysts and maybe like big moves in that space, I mean, do you see opportunity with -- or should we be thinking about the Sarah Cannon partnership as an opportunity that could bring a big chunk of new doctors into the network in the coming years? Or how should we be thinking about that? Thank you.
Brian Tyler: Well, oncology is clearly one of the key growth priorities we've identified for the company and talked a lot about over the last years. And there are various capabilities within our oncology ecosystem, distribution as an anchor, GPO as an anchor, our practice management business you saw on clearly important and the innovation we've done around Ontada and the most recent addition of Genospace and the Sarah Cannon joint venture. So, we think all of these things sort of add to our differentiation, add to the attractiveness of McKesson as a service provider and a partner in this area. We've been really happy to be continuing to add to the growth of the US Oncology Network. We do it in a very disciplined way.  We have a model that works for us and any acquired practices need to be able to operate consistent within that model. But it's clearly our actions this last quarter indicate, we have opportunities to continue to grow and expand. And we think that, that's part of our model and we expect that we can continue that into the future.
Rachel Rodriguez: And we have time for one more question, please.
Operator: That question will come from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.
A.J. Rice: Thanks for everyone. Maybe just to get you to expand, if possible, a little bit more on your comments around specialty and the development of biosimilars. I guess if you look out over the next few years, we have a significant number converting. I know it depends in your business on how that drug is administered today and how it's -- the patient receives it but as to how much benefit you'll derive. But is there a way to talk about how you see that progressing over time? And then maybe another aspect of that is we hear from a number of players that they're expecting to put more resources behind specialty and grow. Can you give us a little bit of a sense of how you assess the competitive landscape at this point and your positioning?
Brian Tyler: Well, I would start by saying that the contributions from biosimilars has been increasing over the past years. We do think the pipeline holds a lot of promise. It continues to strengthen, and we think this could be a long-term opportunity really exists in front of us. I mean to date, there's 40 approved biosimilars, 25 launched, I guess, maybe 26 because if you count today's news on HUMIRA. And the impact of those are going to really be dependent on the rates of adoption, things like the interchangeability. For us, clearly, the channel will matter. Part B is we have more services to offer and more support we can provide to those biosimilars in Part B, Part D will be less impactful. But I think we continue to look at the majority of the opportunity being ahead of us. I do think this market is still young, and I think as people get more experience with biosimilars, we would be hopeful that adoption rates would continue to accelerate. But it depends on things like pricing strategies that the innovator adopts and the biosimilar comes to market with. So, there's a lot of dynamics that I think are still playing out like they always do in a young market. But we're in the very early days, and we believe biosimilars will be good for our business model going forward. Okay. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining our call this evening. Appreciate, as always, the thoughtful questions. I want to thank Carrie, our operator, for facilitating this call. Let me just wrap up by saying McKesson delivered really good third quarter results. And it's really driven by the continued momentum in our underlying business. I'm confident in our ability to consistently execute on our company priorities and drive sustainable long-term growth as a diversified health care services company. None of this is possible without Team McKesson, so I'd like to thank everyone for their dedication, for the big and small actions they take every day to help our customers, our partners and our patients. I'm proud to be a member of and the leader of Team McKesson. Thanks again, everyone, for joining our call. I hope you all have a great evening.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.

===== 2023 Q2  (2022-11-01 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to McKesson's Second Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Rachel Rodriguez: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone, to McKesson's second quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. Today I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements such as forecasts about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com, and to the Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Information about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results, can be found in today's earnings release and presentation slides. The presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and updated guidance assumptions. With that, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian Tyler: Thanks, Rachel, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call. Today McKesson reported another good core with total company revenues of $70.2 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $6.06. When excluding the contributions from COVID-19 related items and McKesson ventures, our adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 11% from the prior year.  As a result of our second quarter performance and business outlook, we are raising our guidance range for fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per diluted share from $23.95 to $24.65, to an updated range of $24.45 to $24.95. We're pleased with the financial performance through the first half of our fiscal 2023 driven by continued execution and momentum across the enterprise.  Our core distribution businesses have performed well and shown great resilience and navigating the dynamic macro environment we're all operating in. We continue to strengthen our competitive advantage oncology and biopharma services through both internal investment and acquisition, as evidenced by the recent RX Savings Solutions acquisition and the Sarah Cannon and joint venture with HCA.  We have established differentiated positioned to win in both oncology and biopharma services, and our defined growth strategy, combined with our company vision is a powerful reflection of how McKesson has transformed into a diversified healthcare services company.  Today, I'm going to focus my remarks on our strategy and highlight the significant progress we've been making across our four company priorities. Then I'm going to turn it over to Britt, who's going to go into more detail on the business performance in our second quarter. Let me start where I always start, and that's with our focus on people and culture. We firmly believe that having the best talent is essential to our ability to consistently execute and deliver strong operating results. We continue to invest in our people, which allows us to attract and retain talent in a tight labor market.  It's important to us that our employees are provided with the support and flexibility they need to thrive, both in work and in their personal lives. Around this time last year, we were really excited to announce a new Wellness Program at McKesson, we called it your day, your way. And we celebrated the second anniversary this past Friday. It was a great pleasure to give our employees, a company-sponsored day off to promote their mental, physical and emotional well being.  We're also committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace, we have a culture where everyone can bring their true authentic selves to work. In October, I signed the CEO letter on disability inclusion, joining a group of inspiring leaders on creating a more inclusive world. This is an important opportunity for McKesson to demonstrate our values and take actions that support our employees and our communities.  Our commitment to diversity is also reflected in our board. Nearly half of our board of directors are women and or people of color. Recently Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, one of the McKesson's independent directors, was presented with the Distinguished Alumni Award by the Direct Women Organizations recognizing her contribution to diversity in the boardroom, and excellence in board service. We're grateful for Kathleen's leadership and her inspiration.  Our second company priority is to drive sustainable growth in our core. Our business is built on a strong foundation of pharmaceutical and medical distribution assets and capabilities across North America. In the U.S., the steady performance of pharmaceutical distribution underpins the operating results of the U.S. pharmaceutical segment. In the second quarter segment revenues increased by 12% year-over-year with growth across multiple customer channels. We continue to expand our reach and deliver unique value propositions to all customers.  In July, we hosted our annual ideas share conference that brought together more than 2,100 independent pharmacies. It was a great forum that encouraged knowledge sharing and collaboration and really deeper connections across our Health Mart pharmacies. McKesson has a long history of supporting and investing in independent pharmacies who have and continue to play such an important role in the health of our communities.  We're also proud of the work our retail pharmacy chain partners play in improving access to care. In September, we announced an agreement in principle to extend our relationship with CVS Health to distribute pharmaceuticals to mail order specialty pharmacies, retail pharmacies, and distribution centers. This agreement goes through June 2027. We've been partners with CVS for more than 20 years, and we're extremely pleased to further this longstanding relationship.  In addition to pharmaceutical distribution, we also have sustainable core distribution assets in the medical surgical segment. In the second quarter segment adjusted operating profit grew 7% When excluding the impact of COVID 19 related items. The solid performance is primarily driven by our scale and reach across the alternate site market. Through years of intentional investment and expansion, the medical surgical segment has established market leading positions in the primary care and extended care markets.  Following the needs of the patients, we're also expanding our services to other channels such as government, consumer, and direct to home markets, we continue to build out one of the largest most tenured sales forces in the industry. These seasoned sales professionals help foster trust and strategic relationships and bring us closer to our customers.  I also want to remind you that while we continue to execute on the European exit, our strategy for our Canadian operations remains unchanged. The Canadian business performed well in the second quarter, aligning with the company strategy, McKesson Canada is expanding its offering to higher growth higher margin areas including digital health solutions.  Our third company priority is to streamline the portfolio which includes our continued progress and exiting our business operations in Europe. Today we announced the completion of the sale to the Phoenix Group, which includes the operations in France, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Belgium and Slovenia. We have now successfully exited 11 of the 12 countries in Europe. Norway remains the only country that's not been divested, but we remain committed to exploring strategic alternatives for this business.  Streamline the portfolio is an ongoing process at McKesson. It doesn't end with the European investors. It's really an ongoing practice for us to continually assess our portfolio for strategic alignment. We have a rigorous evaluation process to ensure that the allocation of resources is optimized to generate shareholder return and support long-term growth for the company. We're also focused on streamlining our businesses internally.  We have and will continue to modernize technology, improve levels of automation and simplify business processes. Taking these actions allows our team to execute with more speed and focus and to make our operational processes less labor intensive and more efficient to better serve our customers and their patients.  Building on the foundation of pharmaceutical and medical distribution, let me now expand on our two growth -- strategic growth areas, the biopharma services and the oncology ecosystem. In the biopharma ecosystem, we have a portfolio of differentiated assets that focused on connecting key stakeholders throughout the patient's journey, and reducing prescription hurdles around access, affordability and adherence.  On our last earnings call, we shared with you examples of the affordability solutions within our biopharma ecosystem. While these solutions can help make prescriptions more affordable for patients, McKesson also has significant offering of adherence to specific capabilities. We have a powerful network of over 4,000 field-based nurses who help patients manage therapies at home.  We also have capabilities for in office provider education through groups of experienced field nurse. Our enhanced services helps patients navigate complex medical issues and increase adherence by more than 25%, leveraging our scaled network and connection to the pharmacies, we continue to explore new solutions and opportunities in the adherence space.  To accelerate our growth in biopharma services, we've been assessing strategic opportunities through both internal and external investment. Today, we completed the acquisition of RX Savings Solutions, which is a benefit insights company that reaches more than 17 million patients. McKesson, in fact has been a customer of RX saving solutions for more than a year. And as a result, we've seen significant improvements in medication affordability and adherence for our members or employees, as well as significant savings at the enterprise level. RX Savings Solutions brings a unique portfolio of products and channel access that are complementary to our existing assets. We're excited to leverage our combined resources to create new capabilities around access, affordability and adherence, as well as new outcome management programs for biopharma and payers.  Prescription technology solutions segment has been delivering strong performance in the past year, and we continue to support the growth with investment and talent. We usually ramp up staffing to prepare for the anticipated support needed for annual customer programs. In the second quarter, the timing and cadence of hiring has led to a slight year-over-year decline in adjusted operating profit in this segment.  Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2023 and beyond, biopharma services remains a large and growing opportunity and we're confident in our differentiated market position that will help us achieve the long-term growth target laid out for this segment. We're also making good progress within oncology ecosystem. On October 31, we completed the transaction that brings together McKesson's U.S. oncology research and HCA's Sarah Cannon Research Institute and a joint venture. The team is energized to work together on integrating the two businesses and we're excited by this opportunity to advance the next generation of cancer care by increasing patient access to clinical trials in the community setting.  As part of the transaction, we also acquired Genospace, a leading innovator in precision medicine and clinical trial matching. It will power oncology data and analytics capabilities for the joint venture and bring enhanced solutions to our provider partners. Also within the oncology ecosystem, Ontada, our data and insights business continues to partner with biopharma companies to advanced cancer research.  It was recently announced that Ontada formed a new strategic alliance with BeiGene. Together they will focus on accelerating the development of real world evidence to improve community education, as well as increased patient access to oncology medicines. The oncology ecosystems expanding and becoming an increasingly important driver for the growth of the U.S. pharmaceutical segment. Our leading market position in community oncology distribution allows us to capture the growing market opportunity driven by a strong pipeline in drug launches.  The U.S. oncology network serves approximately 15% of all new cancer patients in the U.S., and we're pleased that the network continues to attract new physicians to expand its reach and impact. The combined effort and progress on our company priorities, our focus on people and culture on driving sustainable core growth on streamlining the portfolio and expanding the oncology and biopharma services ecosystems are the driving force in advancing our growth strategy and generating long term value for our shareholders.  As I review our strategic priorities, I want to make sure I highlight an important part of our enterprise strategy, which is our continued commitment to sustainability and ESG initiatives. As an impact driven organization, we're dedicated to bringing positive changes to our stakeholders and society. While many impactful projects are happening across the enterprise, our focus has included improving access to health care, advancing health, equity, and protecting our environment.  Two years ago, we created our first ever global impact organization, bringing all ESG initiatives under a single business function. We're also enhancing the governance structure to ensure visibility and accountability to these important initiatives. With consultation from the executive steering committee and direct oversight from our board of directors, our ESG initiatives are deeply intertwined with how we operate our business, foster our culture, and define our strategy.  Before I hand it over to Britt, I wanted to make just a few comments on the macroeconomic trends in the general business environment. In the past quarter, we observed stable prescription volumes and patient utilization trends which were in line with our expectations. While the general economic environment remains quite fluid, the demand for health care proves to be fairly resilient and largely impacted. And I would say this is similar to what we've observed in past economic cycles.  We continue to experience cost inflation and some supply chain disruption impacting different parts of our business in different ways. However, through dedicated and well planned actions, we've been able to manage the impact of these macroeconomic factors. Through the first half of the fiscal year, the financial impact has not been material to McKesson, we continue to monitor the dynamic environment and this time, we do not anticipate any incremental impact in addition to what has already been contemplated in our fiscal 2023 outlook.  Let me pull it all together. McKesson reported a solid second quarter of fiscal 2023. Excluding the impact from COVID-19 related items and European divestitures we're pleased with the momentum in the underlying business. We've demonstrated our ability to execute for growth and strategic advancement while navigating a quite dynamic macroeconomic environment.  We are confident about our market positions and growth trajectory heading into the second half of the fiscal year. Of course, this isn't possible without a talented team committed to working together in service of our partners and patients. I want to thank all the McKesson employees. Their dedication, their hard work, their innovation, their spirit of collaboration are truly transformative and enabling positive impact to our partners, customers and patients.  With that, I'll turn it over to Britt for additional comments.
Britt Vitalone : Thank you, Brian. And good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to report solid financial results for our fiscal second quarter, which reflect operating execution and progress against our growth strategies. As a result of our fiscal second quarter operational and financial performance, combined with our strong financial position and outlook for continued execution in the second half, we are narrowing and increasing our full year fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per diluted share outlook to a range of $24.45 to $24.95.  Let me start with a few company updates before reviewing our second quarter results. During the quarter we made meaningful progress refining and strengthening our portfolio. We completed several key transactions executing against our disciplined capital allocation framework. Let me begin with Europe. As Brian mentioned on October 31, we completed the sale of certain European operations and other assets with the Phoenix Group. We're pleased that we were able to close this transaction sooner than our original fiscal 2023 guidance.  To date we've successfully exited 11 of the 12 European countries that we operated in, and Norway remains the only country that we have not entered into an agreement to sell, and we continue to explore strategic alternatives to exit Norway. Our European exit activities have created a focused portfolio, streamlined capital allocation, and it positions the company for growth in oncology and biopharma services. Next, I'm pleased to report on substantial progress with respect to our oncology and biopharma services growth strategies. Let me start with oncology. In June, we announced an agreement to form a joint venture combining McKesson's U.S. Oncology Research and HCA Healthcare Sarah Cannon Research Institute, including the acquisition of Genospace, Sarah Cannon's personalized medicine platform. On October 31, we closed the transaction and successfully formed the joint venture. McKesson has a 51% ownership interest and will consolidate the results of operations within our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, beginning with our fiscal third quarter.  This transaction further advances our oncology ecosystem, which contains a broad range of scaled and differentiated assets and capabilities. For fiscal 2023, we anticipate that this transaction will have an immaterial impact on our results. We expect the joint venture and the Genospace acquisition to be $0.10 to $0.20 accretive by the end of fiscal 2026 on an adjusted earnings per share basis. Let me next move to biopharma services. In September, we announced an agreement to acquire Rx Savings Solutions, a prescription price transparency and benefit insight company that offers affordability and adherence solutions to health plans and employers. Today, we announced the completion of the acquisition of Rx Savings Solutions, which will be included in our Prescription Technology Solutions segment. The addition of Rx Savings Solutions complements our existing biopharma services assets and supports our vision to improve access affordability and adherence. We anticipate this transaction will represent a modest headwind to fiscal 2023. We anticipate that Rx Savings Solutions will be $0.50 to $0.60 accretive by the end of fiscal 2026 on an adjusted earnings per share basis. As you've heard me say before and as is the case with all our recent acquisitions, we prioritize the deployment of capital towards growth directly on our stated strategies of oncology and biopharma services in a manner that delivers sound financial returns. These transactions represent capital deployment that make both great strategic and great financial sense. Moving to a review of our second quarter fiscal 2023 results. My comments today will refer to our adjusted results on a year-over-year basis, unless I state otherwise. Consolidated revenues of $70.2 billion increased 5%, reflecting growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, partially offset by lower revenues in the International segment, which were a result of our European divestiture activities. Gross profit was $3.1 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 7%. Excluding the impact of our European business operations and completed divestitures, gross profit increased 5%, primarily a result of increased volumes in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. Operating expenses in the quarter decreased 11%, largely driven by completed European divestitures in the International segment and lower opioid litigation costs. Operating profit was $1.2 billion, a decrease of 6% due to lapping of prior year equity investment gains within McKesson Ventures portfolio and completed divestitures in the International segment, partially offset by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. When excluding the impact related to the distribution of COVID-19-related products and net gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments, operating profit increased 6%. Moving below the line. Interest expense was $55 million in the quarter, an increase of 22% primarily due to the unfavorable impacts in our derivative portfolio as we exit the European region. These impacts were partially offset by a net reduction of debt year-over-year. And the effective tax rate was 19.9% for the quarter. Wrapping up our consolidated results. Second quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 144.1 million, a decrease of 8%, resulting from share repurchases in fiscal 2022 and the first half of fiscal 2023. Overall, second quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $6.06, a decrease of 1% compared to the prior year. Moving now to our second quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 7 through 12 and starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Revenues were $60.1 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year, resulting from increased volume of specialty products, including higher volumes from retail national account customers and market growth, which was partially offset by branded-to-generic conversions. Operating profit increased 3% to $756 million, led by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems, partially offset by lower demand of COVID-19 vaccine distribution. The contribution from our contract with U.S. government for COVID-19 vaccine distribution provided a benefit of approximately $0.24 per share in the quarter compared to $0.28 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution, the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment delivered operating profit growth of 5%. In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, revenues were $1 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year, driven by growth in prescription volumes in our third-party logistics business and technology service revenues. Compared to Q1, revenues were lower due in part to the timing of customer-driven promotional activity recognized in the first quarter in our third-party logistics business. Operating profit decreased 2% to $141 million driven by higher operating expenses resulting from the timing of increased head count to support customer annual verification activities, which include hub and patient support programs. Moving now to Medical Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $2.8 billion, a decrease of 9%, as growth in the primary care business was offset by lower sales for COVID-19 tests year-over-year. Operating profit decreased 4% to $307 million driven by lower sales of COVID-19 tests, partially mitigated by performance within primary care distribution. Within our Primary Care business, we continue to see the effect of a stronger flu season when compared to the prior year. The contribution from COVID-19 tests and our contract with the U.S. government for the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies provided a total benefit of approximately $0.33 per share in the quarter compared to $0.44 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Excluding the impact of COVID-related items, the Medical Surgical Solutions segment delivered operating profit growth of 7%. Next, let me address our international results. Revenues were $6.2 billion and operating profit was $137 million, a decrease of 16%. On an FX-adjusted basis, revenues were $6.9 billion, a decrease of 25% and operating profit was $151 million, a decrease of 7%. Second quarter results reflect the year-over-year effect from the divestitures of McKesson's UK and Austrian businesses. Moving on to Corporate. Corporate expenses were $144 million, an increase of 73% year-over-year. During the quarter, we had net losses of $3 million related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio compared to net gains of approximately $97 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. As a reminder, the impacts on consolidated results can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment quarter-to-quarter. As a result, McKesson's investments may result in gains or losses, the timing and magnitude of which can vary for each investment. The year-over-year impact from our McKesson Ventures portfolio was partially offset by lower opioid-related litigation expenses in the quarter. We incurred opioid-related litigation expenses of $9 million in the second quarter, and we anticipate that fiscal 2023 opioid-related litigation expenses will be approximately $50 million. Turning now to our cash position, which can be found on Slide 13. As a reminder, our cash position, working capital metrics and resulting cash flows can each be impacted by timing and vary from quarter-to-quarter. We ended the quarter with $2.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents.  During the first six months of the fiscal year, we made $222 million of capital expenditures, which include investment in distribution center capacity and automation and investments in technology, data and analytics to support growth priorities, including our oncology and biopharma services ecosystems. For the first six months of fiscal 2023 and 2022, we had negative free cash flow of $56 million and $109 million, respectively.  Year-to-date, we returned $1.6 billion of cash to our shareholders, which included $1.5 billion of share repurchases and $139 million in dividend payments. And we have $5.8 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Let me turn now to our fiscal 2023 outlook. A full list of our assumptions can be found on Slides 15 through 18 in our supplemental slide presentation. And I'll begin with our consolidated outlook. Our fiscal 2023 guidance assumes 3% to 7% revenue growth and 4% decline to 2% growth for operating profit compared to fiscal 2022.  Let me provide updated guidance for contribution from COVID-19 programs. Our revised guidance includes $1.45 to $1.65 of contribution attributable to the following items: $0.60 to $0.70 related to the U.S. government's vaccine distribution in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment; $1 to $1.10 related to COVID-19 tests and the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies in our Medical Surgical Solutions segment; and approximately $0.15 of net losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments. We anticipate corporate expenses in the range of $580 million to $620 million, which includes net losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments, which we reported in the first half of the fiscal year. As you've heard me say before, it's difficult to predict when gains and losses on the McKesson Ventures portfolio companies may occur, and therefore, our practice has been and will continue to not include the test end Ventures portfolio estimates in our guidance. When excluding the impacts related to the U.S. government's centralized COVID-19 vaccine distribution and the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies, COVID-19 tests and net gains or losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments, we anticipate operating profit to increase 4% to 10%. Moving below the line. We anticipate interest expense to be in the range of $225 million to $235 million. The increase compared to the prior guidance reflects our intent to Rx Savings Solutions acquisition with new debt. Our anticipated full year effective tax rate of approximately 18% to 20% remains unchanged. And based on our second quarter results and continued solid operating performance, including the contribution from COVID-19-related items, we are increasing and narrowing our guidance range for fiscal 2023 to a range of $24.45 to $24.95 from the previous range of $23.95 to $24.65. The increased guidance also includes the reduced outlook in our International segment from the earlier-than-expected European closing of the transaction with the PHOENIX Group. Excluding the impacts of COVID-19-related items and net gains and losses from McKesson Ventures equity investments from both fiscal 2023 guidance and fiscal 2022 results, our fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings guidance indicates approximately 11% to 14% growth over the prior year. This outlook aligns with the previously communicated long-term growth targets, and it demonstrates the commitment to deliver sustainable growth. Moving now to the segment outlook. We continue to be pleased with the growth we are seeing in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. The breadth of our services and solutions continue to resonate across retail, health systems and provider settings. The value of our core distribution platform was exemplified by the recent agreement in principle to extend our pharmaceutical distribution partnership with CVS Health through June of 2027. We also anticipate further growth across our oncology ecosystem, including a joint venture between McKesson's U.S. Oncology Research and HCA Sarah Cannon Research Institute. And we intend to accelerate operating expense investments in the second half of fiscal 2023 to further extend our leadership position in oncology. Our positive outlook on the growth trajectory of this segment is reflected in our updated ranges. We anticipate reported revenue to increase 12% to 15% and operating profit to increase 3% to 6%. As I outlined earlier, our outlook includes approximately $0.60 to $0.70 related to COVID-19 vaccine distribution to the U.S. government, a result of the previously disclosed contract extension through July of 2023. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution for the U.S. government, we anticipate 5% to 7% operating profit growth, which is above the long-term growth target. In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we anticipate revenue growth of 10% to 16% and operating profit growth of 16% to 22%. We will continue to invest and build capabilities to focus on increasing access, affordability and adherence solutions for patients. The acquisition of Rx Savings Solutions accelerates our capabilities. This segment continues to perform in line with the trajectory assumed in our long-term outlook, and its growth over the last few years reflects the ongoing investment and focus. In the Medical Surgical Solutions segment, we anticipate reported revenues to decrease 4% to 8% and operating profit to decrease 3% to 6%. As previously mentioned, our outlook includes approximately $1 to $1.10 related to COVID-19 tests and the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government, which incorporates the contract extension with the U.S. government to January of 2023. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 related items, we anticipate Medical Surgical operating profit to increase 11% to 15%. Finally, in the International segment, we anticipate revenues to decline by 42% to 46% and operating profit to decline by 27% to 33%. This year-over-year decrease includes the loss of operating profit contribution from businesses and transactions we have closed to date, including the recently closed transaction with the PHOENIX Group.  For fiscal 2023, we anticipate our European operations will contribute operating profit of approximately $0.85 to $1 per diluted share primarily in the first nine months of the fiscal year. This includes year-to-date contributions from operations prior to completed sales, our operations in Norway and contribution related to held-for-sale accounting for the transaction with the PHOENIX Group. We are pleased to have closed the transaction with the PHOENIX Group. This transaction closed earlier than we had anticipated, negatively impacting prior operating profit guidance, and is the main driver behind the change in guidance for this segment. Let me conclude my fiscal 2023 outlook remarks with a review of cash flow and capital deployment. In fiscal 2023, our cash flows, including the timing and progression, have been impacted by European divestiture activity and other transactions. For fiscal 2023, we continue to anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses. Our free cash flow guidance includes approximately $900 million of negative impacts from our European operations and divested assets. our North American businesses continue to generate strong free cash flow.  Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, and our strong balance sheet affords us the flexibility to pursue multiple capital allocation priorities concurrently. We will continue to prioritize growth, principally in the areas of oncology and biopharma services, as evidenced by our joint venture with the Sarah Canon Research Institute, the acquisition of Genospace and the acquisition of Rx Savings Solutions. We also remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders. Our outlook incorporates plans to repurchase approximately $3.5 billion of shares in fiscal 2023, which we anticipate will be largely complete by the end of our fiscal third quarter. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2023 to be in the range of approximately $142 million to $144 million. In summary, we are pleased with our first half fiscal 2023 performance. The strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities and the execution of our proven strategies gives us the confidence and visibility to raise our earnings guidance. We continue to create value for our shareowners through solid growth, cash flow generation and return of capital. Our strong leadership and the tremendous ongoing commitment of our people across McKesson gives us confidence that we will continue to deliver sustainable results. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Percher with Nephron Research.
Eric Percher : Thank you. Question with respect to the strength in pharma on the op profit line, and I think you differentiated that strength coming from provider and health system versus the national account. Can you give us some sense for what you think is going on with the macro trend? If that's continuing to run stronger, how much of this is driven by specialty distribution specifically? And then do you think that there's an element of investments you made in specialty fiscal year '19 to '21 and or ongoing investments that are also helping generate above-market trend?
Brian Tyler : Yeah. Eric, it's Brian. I'll jump in and then Britt can add any color that he'd like. I mean, first off, just in terms of kind of overall market trends and expectations, I think I'd characterize it as pretty stable. I think that the volume in terms of prescription transactions that we've been seeing is in line with what we expected at the beginning of the year, probably slightly ahead of where we would have been pre-COVID. I mean there are parts of the market that are still recovering, but as a general characterization, I would say it's pretty stable and pretty good growth. As it relates to some of the McKesson-specific assets, we've spent the better part of 15 years building up our differentiated capabilities in community distribution with particular strength in oncology. And I think as we look at the growth of the oncology pipeline, we think that, that continues to be a strength, certainly supports our growth. We have pretty robust value propositions for our community providers and our hospital partners. We think we bring them solutions to help them do their business better. And so I would just say it's probably a combination of all of those things that are supporting our growth. Biosimilars, while still early, has certainly helped support that growth. And we think we're well positioned to continue to benefit as that trend continues to unfold.
Britt Vitalone : Eric, this is Britt. Maybe I'll just make a comment on the investments. We have been investing in this space, and we talked about investments that we were making specifically in Ontada, which has become a really important part of really the breadth of assets and capabilities we have in oncology. And Brian referenced today a strategic alliance that we're forming within Ontada with BeiGene, which is a good example of making investments for future growth.  And we're just going to continue to do that and lean into oncology. We think that we have differentiated assets and really the breadth of services and capabilities we have from distribution, data and analytics, our Ontada business and now with the Sarah Cannon Research joint venture, we feel well positioned to continue to lean in and make investments there.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please. 
Operator: And next is Michael Cherny with Bank of America.
Michael Cherny : Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. I would love to dive into the Prescription Tech Solutions segment a bit, if I can. You talked about some of the hiring that you've done relative to supporting customer actions. I guess maybe a two-part question. One, is that temporary hiring? Or is that people that are going to be on your payroll going forward? And then two, relative to the updated guidance, you took down revenue growth for the segment by 500 basis points but kept EBIT growth. Can you give us a sense on what the difference is between those two levels and how you're able to generate the sustained EBIT performance despite the slower revenue growth?
Brian Tyler : Yeah. Sure, Michael. I'll take the first part of that question, and then Britt can take the second part. So relative to the hiring, there is a annual component to some of these programs where we have to reverify patients' eligibility and such. And it is, I guess, you could call it seasonal or a spike, if you will. We don't expect it to be temporary. It's recurring every year. Candidly, as we came into this period with the labor market looking like it was looking we were probably aggressive in trying to make sure we could secure those resources ahead of time. And frankly, we didn't treat as much as we'd want. So I think is a good reflection of McKesson as an employer of choice in the marketplace. But those two things pinched us, but we think we'll work through that over the coming quarters.
Britt Vitalone: As it relates to the question on revenue, as we've talked about previously, a large component of the revenue, at least within this segment, is related to third-party logistics services. And that business can often be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. And so as we think about the third-party logistics business for the full year, that is really a key driver to the reduction in our revenue. That is lower-margin business, and we've talked about that mix impact in the past. And so as we think about the underlying technology services and programs that we run, the revenue there is still strong and the margins remain quite solid.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please. 
Operator: Next will be Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. And good afternoon. I just want to go back to a couple of the comments that you made on the call. One, you talked about stable utilization and demand being resilient. I'm just curious, how are you thinking about the impact of flu? It's been a couple of years since we've had a severe flu season. That's expected, at least based on what we've seen in the Southern Hemisphere. And then secondly, when we think about the impact of the CVS renewal, Brian or Britt, one of the things that have took out to me over the years is that McKesson never calls out a renewal as being a headwind. But I'm just curious, one, is there any impact that you're absorbing from that renewal? And two, are there any incremental services or anything else that you would call out with the relationship with CVS?
Brian Tyler : Let me take those in reverse order. So relative to CVS, we're obviously very pleased to extend what's been a long-standing relationship. It's obviously a big relationship. A ton of complexity supporting a customer as sophisticated as CVS. The services that we're providing will largely be unchanged. We're still doing the fulfillment for their mail-order pharmacies for their forward distribution centers for some of their stores. So that's largely unchanged. In terms of the financials associated, we don't comment on the specific customer financials, as you might expect, for lots of reasons. But I will say that we've contemplated the renewal and the guidance that Britt walked you through earlier. And then as it relates to the flu, we are seeing flu season develop. We expect it will probably be more like a pre-COVID flu season than what we've experienced in the last few years. The impact of flu in general, there's various components, three probably. There's the flu vaccines themselves. There's the flu testing and test kits that go around the flu. And then there's any incremental office visits or front-of-store sales associated with cough and cold kinds of medicines. So we're well positioned against each of those. The vaccine component is probably not as important as the flu testing, to be quite candid. But as you know, we are very capable and scaled distributor of flu vaccines, and frankly, all vaccines. And materialize, we think we'll be well positioned to capture that.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question please. 
Operator: And next will be Steven Valiquette with Barclays.
Steven Valiquette : Great, thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. So you guys normally don't call out very many monthly trends, which I think everybody kind of understands. But back at that investor conference in September, you guys did call out that roughly 7% prescription volume growth across your business in fiscal 1Q ending in June, and you mentioned that July was kind of softer versus that trend.  So I guess, just to put that to bed, was July just kind of an anomaly? Maybe you could just speak to prescription trends kind of exiting the quarter versus what you saw in that July. If July was just an anomaly, it'd be good just to kind of address that and just put that to bed. Thanks.
Brian Tyler : Hi, Steve, this is Britt. Thanks for the question. You are correct. We did talk about first quarter prescription volumes on average about 7% year-over-year. When we talked about prescription trends at Morgan Stanley, we were really giving a flash view, and that flash view was predominantly our view on July, which did end up being pretty much an anomaly. It was the lowest point that we've seen for prescription volume transactions in the first six months of the year. On average, in the second quarter, year-over-year, total prescription volumes increased about 4.5%. That's well within the range that we had in our guidance at the beginning of the year. As I mentioned at the conference, we were still seeing transactions in -- within our guidance. So it still remains within our guidance.  And as I talked about, the first quarter was just slightly stronger. We were seeing an illness season extend into that first quarter. So 7% on average year-over-year in the first quarter and the second quarter on average, about 4% to 5%. And July ended up being really the low point that we called out at the conference.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please. 
Operator: Next will be Charles Rhyee with Cowen.
Charles Rhyee: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Just a point of clarity on the MedSurg Solutions guidance. Just to -- maybe I missed it earlier. Just -- can you just remind us? You talked about upping the guidance related to the kitting part, the one we look at the -- obviously, top line is better. What were the factors for the decline? Is that just FX-related? Or can you just remind -- maybe I just missed it, I apologize.
Britt Vitalone : So let me just see if I can translate this a little bit. The decline is in our AOP. It's a very modest decline from the previous guidance. We're still showing 11% to 15% growth excluding COVID-related items. So that's well above the long-term guidance range that we gave at our Investor Day. So we feel very comfortable with that. There is no FX that runs through the medical segment. So our guidance still remains very solid. Our AOP guidance, excluding COVID-related programs, 11% to 15% is still above our long-term targets that we provided you.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please. 
Operator: Next will be Kevin Caliendo with UBS.
Kevin Caliendo : Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. In the MedSurg side, you noted growth in the Primary Care business. Can you call out like what's happening there? Is that a change in doc visits? Is it you're able to generate more revenue from primary care? Is it a mix issue? Just any more color on what's happening there, it would be interesting.
Brian Tyler : Well, I think it's probably the confluence of all of those things. We talked earlier about the presence of flu in the marketplace for the first time in a while. That certainly helped support the growth there. There's -- the last several years have been quite dynamic, obviously, in terms of missed procedures, electric -- elective procedures, things of that nature. What I would point you to is that the medical business is a very broad business. We have reached into all the alternate-site markets. So it's not just physician office narrowly defined. It's urgent care clinics, it's retail pharmacy-based clinics, it's ambulatory surgery centers. Really anywhere a patient might present in the community to consume medical care, we have reach and support into that customer base. So it's kind of a follow-the-patient kind of strategy. And obviously, as illnesses circulate in the community, that tends to support that business segment.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question please. 
Operator: And next will be George Hill with Deutsche Bank.
George Hill : Hey, good evening, guys. And I appreciate you taking the question. I guess I'm going to ask one more on the medical segment. I guess I would expect that we're starting to see a decline in utilization as it relates to PPE, which probably is reflected in the updated guide. I guess could you talk, Brian, a little bit about product categories where you're seeing strength and product categories where you might be seeing weakness? Just probably focusing a little less on site of care it. Just would like to know which product categories are reflecting positively versus negatively.
Brian Tyler : I mean, generally, I would say -- you asked about PPE. I would say, generally, we think that's been pretty stable. Britt, correct me if I'm wrong, I think we're well into the kind of the massive spikes in the presence of COVID. And so I think that that's been relatively stable. I think it's definitely a portfolio of products. I mean we're supporting pharmaceuticals, we're supporting lab, we're supporting commodity, medical supplies. We obviously have a large mature private brand program, which helps underpin and support our growth as we continue to grow and penetrate that. So I think it's probably all of those factors, no single factor.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question please. 
Operator: And this will be Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut : Good afternoon, guys. Britt, just a question on the guidance rate on the vaccine and kitting side. Obviously, there's a lot of discussion about how the uptake in the vaccine is pretty slow. So just curious what your assumptions are that prompted you to raise that guidance for vaccinations. Thanks
Britt Vitalone : Yeah. Thanks for the question. As we've talked about from the beginning, we take our guidance really from the government, and we factor that in both from a vaccine perspective and as how we support the building of ancillary supply kits. And so as we've talked about at the beginning of the year, we anticipated that the volumes for the program would continue to decline versus the prior year. That is, in fact, the case. They haven't declined as fast as we had anticipated, but they are down year-over-year. They are continuing to come down from prior -- from the fourth quarter. And in our guidance for the rest of the year, we anticipate that the second half will actually be lower than the first half. So we are seeing that the centralized program is beginning to slow down. And we would expect that as our contracts expire, our medical contract expires in January and the vaccine distribution expires in June, that, that will return at that point to the -- not from a centralized program back into a distributor model.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question please. 
Operator: And next will be AJ Rice with Credit Suisse.
AJ Rice: Thanks. Hi, everyone. Just on your initiative around it's access, adherence and affordability in the biopharma segment, I wonder if you could just walk us through the economic model associated with that. Is it fee-based compensation shared results somehow that you're getting? And then you say the step-up -- you offered the step-up in Rx Savings accretion over the next year is pretty dramatic. What are the milestones to get to that accretion target?
Brian Tyler : So I'll start with kind of the business model. I mean in our portfolio today, we have a mix of really transaction-based -- think of it as a click every time a transaction goes through. We have more programmatic models, where you pay for a service over a period of time. And then the Rx Savings Solutions model specifically is more of a subscription-type model. So we really got a nice mix across the segment, and we're quite pleased with that mix. We're really excited about adding the Rx Savings Solutions to our portfolio. They serve about 17 million patients. It's really on point for access and affordability for patients. And we think there's a high complementarity between some of the programs and services that we offer in the legacy business that we can use to augment the value proposition Rx Savings solutions has and use their technology and AI and their really analytics to help support some of the legacy McKesson programs as well. So we're super excited about that, of bringing these assets together.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question please. 
Operator: And next will be Liz Anderson with Evercore.
Liz Anderson : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I appreciate the update you gave us on sort of the pieces -- moving pieces in the Prescription Technology Solutions. Ex what you were talking about in terms of the guidance step-down for the the logistics business, can you talk about how sort of some of those other core businesses in that segment are doing in terms of CoverMyMeds or some of the others that we've heard have contributed over time?
Brian Tyler : So I'd say that Britt talked about the mix with 3PL, and I think he rightly characterized that as there's some -- I don't know the word he used, wasn't volatility, but there is some 
Britt Vitalone : Lumpiness.
Brian Tyler : Lumpiness, yeah, that's the right way to describe it. There is some lumpiness in that business. When we look at that business, it's really driven in large part by underlying script demand. We're happy to see growth come back there. It's driven by, in some cases, brand launches and our ability to convince brands that the value propositions we have to help them find patients break down the barriers to get those patients started on therapy and then to keep those patients on therapy, we think has a really great ROI.  So historically, we've been able to grow our portfolio of brands and relationships and it's multiple, multiple hundreds now. So that's an important component of that business to keep that growing. And now with RX Savings Solutions, we think we've got a chance to continue to grow the population or the number of people accessing that platform through expanding relationships with payers and expanding relationships with manufacturers to run more sponsored programs.
Rachel Rodriguez: And we have time for one more question, please.
Operator: Certainly. That question will come from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.
Erin Wright : Great. Thanks for taking my question, Britt and Brian. So on the HCA JV, I guess, can you speak to how this positions you in the oncology arena? And can you speak to the financials of the deal? I think from a longer-term perspective, you mentioned some 2026 contributions, but maybe some of the near-term contributions there. And will this help to explain the types of deals that you'll be focused on kind of going forward in terms of partnerships and JVs that are relatively open in terms of that versus outright acquisitions? Thanks.
Brian Tyler : Thank you for the question. We're really encouraged by the great feedback we've got from the oncology community broadly, including the biopharma manufacturers who are deep in oncology. We think through the combination of these two clinical research networks and really their underlying data and analytic capabilities that this is going to enable us to bring greater efficiency to the drug development process. And we also think, importantly, it's going to help more cancer patients access newer life-saving medications. And oftentimes, in absence of a JV like this in the community setting, it's hard for people to find out they're eligible for a clinical trial and they might be able to benefit from a trial that's going on. We know the uptake in the community setting is much lower. And so we're really excited when we think about the impact this can have on people's lives and helping get communities that are often underserved communities and get those patients enrolled in these programs. So we think this is about enhancing the quality of care by increasing access to novel treatment options. We think it's about helping accelerate the commercial or getting these on new exciting oncolytics to market. And we're excited to have a JV and a relationship with HCA around this. I think one of the things that we would signal to everybody is we've got a very clear strategy. There will be times where we're going to invest organically to activate that strategy. There will be times where we'll do acquisition to activate that strategy, and there are times where combinations like this become, we think, the most effective way to get at activating our strategy. And so we'll have flexibility. We look at every deal on its own and its own merits in terms of its alignment to our strategy and our financial expectations before we decide to move forward with something. In this case, we feel really excited about the partnership with Sarah Cannon and U.S. Oncology Research Network.
Britt Vitalone : The one other thing maybe that I would add, just as a reminder for this JV, we will have 51% of the earnings of the JV. And so we'll be recording that. The $0.10 to $0.20 accretion that I referenced is related to that 51% ownership that we have, and it's specific to the combination of this JV and the JV's activities. There are probably a number of synergies that are unrelated to this. There's a flywheel effect of having it and combining it as part of the overall oncology ecosystem that we're not including at this time. So we'll continue to watch this over time as the JV comes together and forms and some of these synergies really come into play, but we're excited about what it's going to bring to the overall oncology business at McKesson.
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Britt, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. Appreciate the thoughtful questions and your support of McKesson. And thanks to Jenny, our operator, for facilitating the call. McKesson delivered a solid second quarter, really driven by continued momentum in our underlying businesses. I remain confident in our ability to consistently execute on company priorities and to drive sustainable long-term growth. I want to conclude today's call by once again just acknowledging all the great work of Team McKesson. I want to thank each of you for your dedication and what you do every day to help our customers, partners and patients. I'm really proud to be a member and the leader of Team McKesson. Thanks again for joining our call. I hope you all have a terrific evening.
Operator: And thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect. And have a great day.

===== 2023 Q1  (2022-08-03 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Please stand by. Welcome to McKesson's First Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Rachel Rodriguez: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone, to McKesson's first quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. Today I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements such as forecasts about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com, and to the Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Information about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results, can be found in today's earnings release and presentation slides. The presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and updated guidance assumptions. With that, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian Tyler: Thanks, Rachel, and thanks to everyone joining us on our call this afternoon. Earlier today, we announced our first quarter fiscal 2023 results with strong growth in total company revenue and adjusted operating profit across the North American businesses. As a result of our first quarter performance and McKesson's continued role in the COVID-19 response efforts, we are raising our guidance range for fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per diluted share from $22.90 to $23.60 to a new range of $23.95 to $24.65, successful execution against our company's priorities, priorities of people and culture, sustainable core growth, streamlining the portfolio and expanding the oncology and biopharma services ecosystems are really what underpin our fiscal 2023 outlook and our long-term growth framework. So I wanted to center my remarks today around those themes. And I thought I would start maybe with a highlight of the progress we've made against our company priorities and then I will wrap up with a few brief comments on the performance in the business itself. Foundational to our company, foundational to our company's history quite frankly and our strategy are really the core pharmaceutical and medical distribution businesses. As we expand the reach of our services, we remain focused on generating sustainable growth in these core businesses. Our operational excellence and ability to leverage our scale with global suppliers is one of the many reasons why McKesson continues to be a partner of choice for our customers. Over the past two years, you're well aware, we've been working closely with the U.S. government to distribute the COVID-19 vaccine and ancillary kits. As requested by the U.S. government, our contract to serve as the centralized distributor for COVID-19 vaccines was extended through July of 2023. Similarly, the contract for ancillary kits and storage was extended through January of 2023. We are – well, we continue to be honored and privileged to be able to leverage our distribution scale and expertise and to continue to support this important public health effort. Britt will comment a little more specifically on the financial impacts of these contract extensions, but we continue to look forward to serving the U.S. government for several more months in this capacity. I mean, building upon the success of the core distribution businesses, we like to say we're tackling some of the most complicated problems in healthcare through the expansion of our oncology and our biopharma services ecosystems. In the first quarter, we were really excited to announce the formation of a joint venture between McKesson's U.S. Oncology Research and HCA's – HCA Healthcare's Sarah Cannon Research Institute. This transaction marks a really important alliance between two of – between these two companies and we expect it will accelerate our strategic advancement of the oncology ecosystem. By combining the resources and the expertise of these two organizations, we're creating an expanded clinical research network and that really means a broader portfolio of clinical trial offerings, expanded patient reach, access to a broader set of data and more advanced analytics capabilities to better match patients with clinical trials. The new joint venture will really also aim at accelerating drug development and increasing availability and access to clinical trials for community oncology providers and patients, including those in underserved communities. This transaction enhances our proposition to biopharma companies and further advances our differentiated offerings across the entire pharmaceutical life cycle. It is also purposeful. It reinforces our commitment as a company to advance health outcomes for all. We expect to close the transaction by the end of calendar year 2022 and we look forward to the partnership, the collaboration and greater outcomes we can bring to the patients we collectively serve. We're also making meaningful progress on expanding our biopharma services ecosystem. Through years of intentional investment, we've built a suite of innovative biopharma solutions that supports really every phase of the medication life cycle across nearly all therapeutic categories. We're reinventing how biopharma companies, providers and payers can connect to each other through technology with the ultimate goal of really helping patients' access, afford and adhere to their medications. Today I thought I might share a few examples around our affordability efforts and how these efforts fit into our biopharma ecosystem. A key piece of our innovative medication affordability product suite is our automatic couponing program. This automatic couponing program really applies co-pay offsets or savings for qualified medications right at the point of dispensing. Using our technologies, it's seamlessly integrated into the pharmacy workflow. We further help patients stay on their trusted brands through multichannel support options like activity inform messaging about other discounts, real-time support and educational materials. We also facilitate patient assistance programs, which are critical financial safety net for millions of patients. We implement and administer comprehensive patient assistant programs through program pharmacies, which enable access to free medication programs to eligible patients treated at hospitals in community care settings and sometimes even at home. Both of these solutions leverage the reach of our technology network. And in fiscal year 2022, our solutions enabled patients to save more than $6 billion on brand and specialty medications. And importantly, we prevented more than 9 million prescriptions from being abandoned. By improving affordability of prescriptions in many instances these solutions also improve adherence, helping patients stay on the treatment longer, which leads to better health outcomes. As we look ahead, we continue to be proud of our differentiated assets and capabilities and we're excited to bring innovative solutions to more partners and patients. Oncology and biopharma services both represent large, complex and growing markets for McKesson and we're strategically positioned to continue to enhance value in these areas. I want to talk a bit about our next priority, which is streamline the portfolio. It's absolutely imperative that we continue to focus our human and our financial capital into the highest growth and highest margin areas of the company. And part of that is a continual assessment of our portfolio for strategic alignment. This includes the progress we're making towards fully exiting the European region. We recently entered into an agreement to sell Denmark and the transaction was closed on July 29, 2022. The pending transaction with the PHOENIX Group is progressing well. We characterize it as on track and has an expected close in the second half of our fiscal 2023. Norway really remains the only country that we have not yet announced an agreement to sell. So now one year after we announced McKesson's strategic intent to exit the European region, we've entered into agreements to sell or we have completed divestitures of the business operations in 11 of the 12 countries in Europe. So I'm really pleased with the execution of this important initiative, I think the teams have got after it with remarkable speed and efficiency. I want to wrap up my review of our company's priorities by reaffirming our focus on people and culture. In fact, it's typically the first priority we mention. We believe that talent can truly be differentiating and we continue to invest in the development of our employees. It's – we provide our employees not only competitive compensation and competitive benefits, but also the resources and support they need to grow into the next generation of leaders for McKesson. It's an organization. We're committed to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion and we continue to increase leadership representation for women in North America and people of color in the U.S. In fact, just recently, McKesson was recognized by Forbes as one of the best employers for women achieving an industry leading ranking. This is a demonstration of our outstanding progress in promoting equity and diversity in the workplace and really in my view reflects our deep commitment to support all employees at McKesson, all employees at McKesson. Additionally for the seventh consecutive year, McKesson was named the Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion, which includes earning a top ranking score of 100 on the 2022 Disability Equality Index. I'm proud of the progress that we've made on all of our company's priorities and we can clearly see it helping advance our long-term growth. Before I turn over – before I turn my attention to our first quarter results, I did want to just provide everyone a quick update on the progress of the opioid related litigations. This past quarter, we reached agreements in principle with the State of Washington and the State of Oklahoma. With the recent developments, we have settled or we've reached agreements to settle the opioid related claims of all 50 states, the District of Columbia and all eligible territories. The majority of the payments that will fund as part of these settlements will be used on opioid relief programs. We're particularly proud of that. And we’ll support a wide variety of strategies in local communities to help fight opioid crisis. In July, after a full trial, a federal judge ruled that McKesson, along with two other distributors, could not be held liable to two West Virginia subdivisions for contributing to the opioid crisis. This ruling is significant as the court confirmed that McKesson did not cause an oversupply of opioids in these communities. As we move forward, our role in combating opioid abuse is not over. McKesson will remain part of the solution when it comes to relief across the country and in preventing opioid diversion within the pharmaceutical supply chain. Let's move on to business performance. And I want to start by just providing a few comments on the macroeconomic trends and environment that we're seeing and what the potential impacts are on McKesson's business. In the past quarter we have observed positive prescription volumes and positive patient utilization trends. Additionally, as the macroeconomic environment continues to evolve, our business model has remained resilient to the pressures from cost inflation and supply chain disruption. The impact from these macroeconomic factors was immaterial in Q1, and we do not anticipate any incremental impact in addition to what was already contemplated in our fiscal 2023 outlook. We remain confident in our ability to navigate a dynamic economic environment. We have a diverse set of products and solutions that allow us to follow the market demands and capture evolving opportunities. And we remain committed to supporting our customers and partners by delivering innovative products and solutions and making quality care more accessible and affordable. Let me quickly summarize the first quarter performance, and then I'm going to turn it over to Britt who will provide additional financial details. I’m going to start with us U.S. Pharmaceutical. We delivered solid first quarter performance in core pharmaceutical distribution led really by our differentiated value proposition and exceptional service to our customers. Throughout the quarter we saw year-over-year growth in prescription volume with positive trends in both branded and generic drugs. Our distribution expertise is reflected in the breadth of product, offering delivery accuracy and reliability of our service. We also remain focused on expanding the oncology ecosystem to strengthen our already differentiated market position. The advancements not only reflected in financial performance and its increasing contribution to the segment growth, but also demonstrated by the research we published, the insights we generated and the partnerships we formed, all focused on empowering innovation and advancing cancer care. Our oncology business has proven to be resilient throughout the pandemic, and we saw stable demand in patient visit trends within our U.S. oncology practices. In Prescription Technology Solution, we're pleased with the growth momentum in the first quarter, driven by access, affordability and adherence solutions. The market demand for our products and solutions remain strong contributing to the organic growth in the core product categories. The strong financial performance also allows us to reinvest into the business and to expand the reach of our biopharma services ecosystem. The continued investment and innovation is critical to the long-term growth of the business. In the medical-surgical solution segment, we again had strong performance led by strength in the primary care marketplace. The demand for COVID tests during the quarter was higher than anticipated, but I would also say generally in line with the COVID case counts. We continue to expand the breadth of our products and services to strengthen our leading capabilities in the alternate site market. And in the International segment, we're progressing well with the divestiture of our European assets. As it relates to our Canadian business, we remain committed to our strategy in the Canadian market, where we have scale and a diverse set of assets. The distribution and retail businesses remain stable, and the team is doing great work driving growth through improved sourcing economics and expanded customer relationships. Let me try to pull everything together. McKesson reported solid first quarter in fiscal 2023. The fundamentals of our business are stable and I'm excited about the meaningful progress we've made against our company priorities. Our updated outlook for fiscal 2023 aligns with the long-term growth targets of the business and demonstrates our commitment to deliver sustainable growth across all segments. Last, I want to be sure to thank my teammates and the employees of McKesson. I'm proud to lead this amazing team. You are all innovative problem solvers that bring positive change to our customers and partners. It's the dedication and the execution from each and every one of our employees that's driving McKesson forward and ultimately helping advance health outcomes for all. With that Britt, why don't you provide some additional color and comments?
Britt Vitalone: Well, thank you, Brian. And good afternoon. We are pleased to report June quarter financial results that continue to demonstrate our ability to grow our businesses and execute effectively as a diversified healthcare services company. Our fiscal first quarter results are ahead of our expectations, reflecting progress against our strategic priorities, demonstrating the continued strength of our operations. Let me begin today with a few company updates before reviewing our first quarter results. I want to start with Europe and our ongoing focus to streamline our portfolio. Over the past few years, we've taken deliberate actions to streamline the business and deploy capital more effectively, ensuring the organization is operationally efficient in delivering solutions that are focused in solving our customers’ biggest challenges. This is exemplified by our actions to exit European region announced in July of 2021. Since that time we've divested or entered into agreements to sell business operations in 11 of the 12 countries in which we operate. To date, we've successfully closed the following transactions. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we completed the sales of our Austrian business in the remaining share of our German joint venture. In April of 2022, we completed the sale of our UK retail and wholesale operations. And in July of 2022, we completed the sale of our Denmark business. The transaction with the Phoenix Group to sell operations in other certain assets in several European countries is also proceeding well. We anticipate it will close in the second half of fiscal 2023 subject to regulatory reviews. We continue to explore strategic alternatives to exit remaining operations in Norway, the only country that we've not yet entered into an agreement to sell. For fiscal 2023, we anticipate our remaining European operations will contribute adjusted operating profit of approximately $0.85 to a $1.15 per diluted share, which includes accretion resulting from the held-for-sale accounting through the transaction with the Phoenix Group. As discussed at our December Investor Day, we intend to deploy capital through share repurchases to offset the dilution resulting from the European divestitures. Exiting operations in Europe allows us to focus on another important strategic priority, expanding our Oncology and Biopharma services ecosystems. We took an important step this quarter in our Oncology ecosystem. In June, we announced an agreement to form a joint venture combining McKesson’s US Oncology Research and HCA Healthcare’s Sarah Cannon Research Institute, including the acquisition of Genospace, Sarah Cannon's personalized medicine platform. The combination of these assets complements our existing operations. It aligns to our strategic growth priorities. It supports our vision to improve care in every setting. The transaction is anticipated to close by the end of calendar year 2022, again, subject to regulatory review and approval. We do not anticipate this transaction will have a material impact on our fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per share outlook. Next, as Brian mentioned earlier, our contract with the U.S. government to serve as a centralized distributor for COVID-19 vaccines was recently extended through July of 2023. And the contract for the kitting and storage of ancillary supplies was extended through January of 2023. I will discuss the impact of fiscal 2023 guidance later in my remarks. Finally, I want to point out one additional item that will impact our fiscal second quarter GAAP only results. In July of 2022, McKesson exited one of its investments in equity securities for proceeds of $179 million. We will recognize a GAAP only gain within other income in the second quarter. Moving now to a review of our first quarter fiscal 2023 results. My comments today will refer to our adjusted results, on a year-over-year basis, unless I state otherwise. Consolidated revenues of $67.2 billion increased 7%, reflecting growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, partially offset by lower revenues in the International segment, as a result of the European divestiture process.  Gross profit was $3 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 4%. Excluding the impact of our European business operations and completed divestitures gross profit increased 9% a result of organic growth in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, increased volume specialty products in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment and growth in the Prescription Technology Solution segment. Operating expenses decreased by 10% in a quarter due to completed divestitures in the International segment. As a result operating profit was $1.1 billion for the quarter; an increase of 4% led by growth in U.S. Pharmaceutical and improved prescription transaction volumes in the Prescription Technology Solution segment.  When excluding the impact related to the distribution of COVID-19 related products and services and gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments, operating profit increased 13% year-over-year. Interest expense was $45 million in the quarter, a decrease of 8% due to a net reduction of debt year-over-year. And the effective tax rate was 18.4% for the quarter. Wrapping up our consolidated results, first quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 145.9 million, a decrease of 8% year-over-year resulting from share repurchases throughout fiscal 2022 and the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Overall, first quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $5.83, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year. Now onto our first quarter segment results, which can be found on slides seven through twelve and starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Revenues were $56.9 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year, resulting from increased specialty product volumes, led by retail national account customers and market growth, which was partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Operating profit increased 4% to $711 million led by growth in distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems, generic launches and improved performance of Ontada, which is partially offset by lower volumes of COVID-19 vaccine distribution. The contribution from our contract with the U.S. government for COVID-19 vaccine distribution provided a benefit of approximately $0.18 per share in the quarter, which is compared to $0.30 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution, the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment delivered operating profit growth of 9%. Results in the quarter benefited from the timing of generic launches and the improved performance of Ontada. Operating margins were modestly lower in the quarter impacted by mix. As the growth from health systems in multi-specialty providers were partially offset by robust retail national account customer growth, which contributed 7% to the overall 14% year-over-year top-line growth. Next is Brian noted earlier, our Prescription Technology Solutions segment delivered another strong quarter. Response to our access, affordability and adherence solutions continue to be strong across biopharma providers and payers. The scale and expanded suite of offerings continued delivered for all stakeholders, including patients. Revenues were $1.1 billion an increase of 21% year-over-year driven by volume growth from biopharma services, which includes third-party logistics services and increased technology service revenues. Operating profit increased 19% to $165 million reflecting the continued favorable market acceptance to a growing set of access, affordability and adherence solutions. Moving down to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $2.6 billion an increase of 3% year-over-year as growth in the primary care business, partially offset anticipated lower demand in sales for COVID-19 tests and lower contribution from kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government’s COVID-19 vaccine program. Operating profit increased 4% to $268 million driven by strength across the primary care business; improve volumes in greater incidents of respiratory illness and the flu contributed to higher testing in patient visits in the primary care business. The contribution from COVID-19 tests and our contract with U.S. government for the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies provided a total benefit of approximately $0.25 per share in the quarter compared to $0.35 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Excluding the impact of these COVID-related items, the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment delivered operating profit growth of 20%. Next, let me address our International results. Revenues were $6.5 billion. An operating profit was $138 million, which was a decrease of 19%. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues were $7.1 billion, a decrease of 23%. An operating profit was $152 million, a decrease of 11%. Our first quarter results reflect the impact from the divestitures in McKesson UK and Austrian businesses. Moving on to Corporate. Our Corporate expenses were $145 million, a decrease of 6% year-over-year. In the quarter, we recognized a tax receivable gain related to our previous change healthcare investment and lower opioid-related litigation expenses. We incurred opioid-related litigation expenses of $19 million in the first quarter; we anticipate that the fiscal 2023 opioid-related litigation expenses would be approximately $45 million. During the quarter, we had net losses of $22 million related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio, which compares to net gains of approximately $7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. As a reminder, the impacts on our consolidated results can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment quarter-to-quarter. And as a result, McKesson’s investments may result in gains or losses, the timing and magnitude of which can vary for each investment. It’s difficult to predict when gains and losses on McKesson Ventures portfolio companies may occur. And, therefore, our practice has been and will continue to not include McKesson Ventures portfolio estimates in our guidance. Let me turn to our cash position, which can be found on Slide 13. As a reminder, our cash position, working capital metrics and resulting free cash flow can be impacted by timing and vary from quarter-to-quarter. We ended the quarter with $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. During the quarter, we made a $100 million of capital expenditures, which includes investments in technology, data and analytics to support our growth priorities, including our oncology and biopharma services ecosystems. For the quarter, we had negative free flow of $1 billion. We also returned $1.1 billion of cash to shareholders during the June quarter, which included $1 billion of share repurchases and $71 million in dividend payments. In July, our Board of Directors approved a 15% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.54 per share. And the board also approved a new $4 billion share repurchase authorization, which brings the total remaining share repurchase authorization to $6.3 billion. Our fiscal 2023 guidance per share repurchases remains unchanged. These actions demonstrate the confidence that the Board of Directors and management have in the execution against our strategic priorities. Our capital deployment principles remain firmly in place. We prioritize growth by investing internally and through M&A our focus continues to center on the areas of oncology and biopharma services, including the expansion of access affordability and adherence solutions. Next, we’ll continued to return capital to shareholders through a combination of our growing dividend and share repurchases. And the third piece of the framework focuses on a strong balance sheet and financial position, which is underpinned by the maintenance of our investment grade credit rating. Let me turn to our fiscal 2023 outlook, starting with a consolidated view. I’ll walk you through the key items beginning with additional details of fiscal 2023 consolidated guidance. A full list of these assumptions can be found on Slides 15 through 19 and our supplemental slide presentation. On a reported basis our fiscal 2023 guidance assumes 3% to 7% revenue growth and flat to 6% operating profit decline compared to fiscal 2022. When excluding the impacts related to the U.S. government’s centralized COVID-19 vaccine and kitting distribution programs, COVID-19 tests and net gains or losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments. We anticipate adjusted operating profit to increase 4% to 10%. We also anticipate corporate expenses in the range of $550 million to $620 million, which includes the impact of net losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments in the first quarter. Given the current interest rate environment, we now anticipate interest expense to modestly increase and be in the range of $205 million to $225 million. Our anticipated full year effective tax rate of approximately 18% to 20% remains unchanged. Based on our first quarter results are continued solid operating performance in each segment and the contract extensions with the U.S. government for COVID-19 vaccine distribution and the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies. We are increasing our guidance range for fiscal 2023 to $23.95 to $24.65 from the previous range of $22.90 to $23.60. Our fiscal 2023 outlook aligns with the previously communicated long-term growth targets, and it demonstrates the commitment to deliver sustainable growth. Our revised guidance also includes $0.99 to a $1.29 of contribution attributable to the following items. $0.35 to $0.45 related to the U.S. government’s vaccine distribution in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. $0.75 to $0.95 related to COVID-19 tests in the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, and $0.11 of net losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments. Excluding the impacts of these COVID-19 related items and net gains and losses from McKesson Ventures equity investments from both fiscal 2023 guidance and fiscal 2022 results. Our fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings guidance indicates approximately 10% to 15% growth over the prior year. Moving now to the segment outlook. In the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, our outlook reflects the solid operating performance in the first quarter, the efficiency and durability of our core distribution platform and continued development of our oncology ecosystem. We anticipate reported revenue to increase 11% to 14% in operating profit to decline approximately 1% to 3% growth year-over-year. Our outlook includes approximately $0.35 to $0.45 related COVID-19 vaccine distribution, a result of the previously outlined contract extension. When excluding impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution for the U.S. government, we anticipate 4% to 6% operating profit growth, which is modestly above the long-term growth target. In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we now anticipate revenue growth of 15% to 21% and operating profit growth of 16% to 22%, which reflects increased affordability solution volumes. In the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, we anticipate reported revenues to 3% to 7% and operating profit to decrease 5% to 10%. Our outlook includes approximately $0.75 to $0.95 related to COVID-19 tests and the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government, which incorporates the contract extension with the U.S. government to January of 2023. Excluding the impact of these COVID-19 related items, we anticipate Medical-Surgical operating profit to increase 11% to 17%. And finally, in the International segment, we continue to anticipate revenues to decline by 34% to 38% and operating profit to decline by 22% to 28%. And this year-over-year decrease includes a loss of operating profit contribution from businesses and transactions we’ve closed to date. And those we expect to close during fiscal 2023. Let me conclude our fiscal 2023 outlook with a few comments on cash flow and capital deployment. In fiscal 2023, we continue to anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses. As a reminder, our working capital metrics and resulting cash flows vary from quarter-to-quarter. Each working capital metric can be impacted by timing and in fiscal 2023 are cash flows including the progression of these cash flows may be impacted by European divestiture activity. Our fiscal 2023 outlook incorporates plans repurchase approximately $3.5 billion of shares. Significant portion of the share buyback assumption is associated with mitigating the year-over-year impact of European divestitures. As a result of the share repurchase activity we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2023 to be in the range of approximately $142 million to $144 million. To wrap up we are pleased with our solid start to the fiscal year. We continue to deliver on our growth strategy as diversified healthcare services company. Our talented associates continue to deliver exceptional performance. Our first quarter financial performance reflects their dedication and their execution in a dynamic operating environment. And it also represents the resiliency of our portfolio. Looking ahead, the combination of our solid first quarter financial performance, our growth strategy and continued execution positions McKesson to deliver sustainable long-term performance and shareholder value creation. With that let me turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Lisa Gill with J.P. Morgan.
Lisa Gill: Thanks very much. Thanks very much and good afternoon. Thanks Brett, for all of the color. I just wanted to go back and make sure I just understand just a couple of things. One, the comment around macro economic trends being immaterial, I know last year you had some wage inflation or gave people bonuses. I'm curious as to what you're seeing right now around wages? And then secondly, want to make sure that I understand how POA works. Is that just a pass through? So as we've seen rising oil prices and higher gas prices, is that something that you can just pass along to your customer and that's why it's a material to you?
Brian Tyler: Well, so Lisa, I'll start with the wage component and you'll recall last year as we track the markets, both nationally and locally we decided midyear to take some wage actions. We mentioned that was probably $0.10 to $0.20 in each of the segments. We brought a perspective into our Fiscal 2023 guide and at this point we still think that that our views on the labor markets and the guidance are in sync. It's something that we'll continue to watch. People are an important part of our value delivery mechanism. It's important that that we stay on top of it, but as we look at key metrics like turnover and service out our doors, we're still comfortable that our assumptions for FY 2023 are the initial outlook we provided you for FY 2023 will be relevant. As it relates to fuel specifically, it's probably a nuanced answer. I think Britt characterized it correctly that it's been immaterial for this fiscal year. In some instances we can contractually pass it through. In other instances, we have the ability to set price and certainly we take actions for efficiency within the operation to continually offset any expenses like that we might have.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please.
Operator: And next will be Michael Cherny with Bank of America.
Michael Cherny: Good afternoon and congratulations on a really nice quarter. As I think about the OpEx management in the quarter, it was something that clearly stood out relative to the outperformance. Aside from some of those dynamics on wage investments, what are some of the push and polls you're seeing in the OpEx line relative to last year? And how should we think about the trajectory of OpEx, at least in terms of the percent of revenue as what, in terms of what you can both manage as well as what will clearly benefit as you get more leverage from faster growth, some of these incremental revenue upside pull troughs?
Brian Tyler: Hey, Mike, thanks for the question. Let me try to tackle that. I think the biggest piece that we identify for our consolidated operations was the divestitures in Europe that drove a lot of the operating expense decline year-over-year. But we also have continued to execute against a lot of our cost initiatives that we began three years ago, and a lot of the efficiency that we've driven into the organization and continue to be focused on not only efficiencies, but driving automation in the company as well. Couple other things that I would point out for sure is in our corporate line we saw lower opioid litigation expenses as compared to the prior year. Now we called that out in our guidance at the beginning of the year, but on a year-over-year basis it was lower in the first quarter and that's going through our corporate line. But I think overall it's a lot of the efficiencies that we've driven in the organization, our cost programs that we've been after now for the last three to four years and the leverage that we're able to get as we continue to drive the corporation for gaining productivity.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays.
Steven Valiquette: Yes, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So yes, if we go back to the analyst day back in December, you guys talked about 12% to 14% EPS growth, excluding COVID and some of the European dilution. I'm trying to quantify what – how that's tracking in Fiscal 2023 ex-those items. So I think on Slide 19, I actually slide 15 apologize. You show the 10% to 15% growth, excluding those items. I'm wondering is that the closest proxy for how this fiscal year is tracking relative to that 12% to 14% metric that you talked about previously? Thanks.
Brian Tyler: Hey Steven, thanks for the question. So what we tried to do with that slide is give you the progression, excluding some of the things that we're working through here, obviously with COVID test kits and vaccines and so forth. The guidance that we gave you is more on a long-term basis and again excluding some of the programs that we have in place, and obviously excluding McKesson Ventures'. When you look at each of our segments, as I talked about them here today our segments have actually performed slightly ahead of the launch of growth rates that we provided at Investor Day. One of the things that we're obviously working through here is the divestitures of Europe and the cadence of those divestitures and obviously what we've talked about from getting here is we're going to try to offset that dilution with share repurchases. But if you look at our operating profit growth excluding the programs that we have with the U.S. government, COVID test kits then you look at the segments that is really in line with the long term growth rates that we provided at Investor Day and on a consolidated basis, the 10% to 15% that we've talked about here today again, also aligns with that long-term guidance. We feel very good that we're on pace that we're tracking against what we, we told you at our Investor Day in December.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please.
Operator: And next will be Eric Percher with Nephron Research.
Eric Percher: Thank you. Question relative to the contract extension with the government and first, are there any changes in the scope of operations for [indiscernible], would you potentially support Novavax or Pfizer? And that'd be interested in your perspective on normalization of distribution of both vaccine and COVID therapies over time?
Brian Tyler: So in terms of the scope of the agreement, really the scope of either agreement has not really changed in terms of the services that we'll provide. We will not – we are not going to expand to do Pfizer, but we are committed to do all of the other U.S. government approved including Novavax as directed by the U.S. government and our facilities are capable and ready to support that. And I would just mimic similarly for the kitting side, although it's probably a little more storage than, than kitting vis-à-vis the early phases of the program when kitting was quite intensive, and what was that, I'm sorry, Erik what was your second question?
Eric Percher: Just your thought on the normalization of distribution into all distributors, both for [indiscernible] and COVID therapies. Are you seeing some of that for your channels?
Brian Tyler: Yes. I mean, I think as relates to the vaccine – the vaccines themselves, those continue to run through the centralized government model to be perfectly candid 2.5 years ago, it would've been hard to imagine we'd still be in this scenario as a nation, just thinking of our public health and the prevalence of the disease that we still see. As we've said all along we're committed to bring our assets and capabilities to help support the public health response in any way we can. We're I guess, happy we have the facility and continue to support the government program. But like most of us probably will not be sad when there's no longer a need for any of this
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please.
Operator: And next will be Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser: Yes. Hi, good afternoon, and congrats on a great quarter. So I have a soft question on the COVID vaccines. If we think about the step-up in guidance for vaccines and kitting, how much of that and has it, or was already captured in the $0.54 beat in the quarter versus your expectation going forward? So that's question number one. And then secondly, to follow up somewhat on Eric's question, I think Moderna said today that they expect the commercial market in 2023 for vaccines. So just – can you maybe help us frame it? How should we think about it? Is this – would this be on top of sort of the contract that you have with the U.S. government, or would that be in lieu off?
Brian Tyler: Do you want to take the guidance question and I'll take the second part.
Britt Vitalone: Yes. Thank for the question, Ricky. So again, I think if you look at our slide presentation, we've tried to call out here, what the big changes are in our guide. Certainly a portion of our first quarter was a result of the increase in both vaccine distribution and the kitting storage and COVID test kits. COVID test kits, as we told you in our guidance would be lower than FY 2022. That has certainly been the case, although it was slightly ahead of our own internal expectations. We continue to expect that test kits will be significantly lower than last year. They are a little bit ahead of our expectations. So in our first quarter, some of the COVID related items and programs did drive some of the upside, but certainly our operating performance was strong. You can see that from the slide that talks about our guidance increase, that there is a significant portion of the increase that's related to those COVID programs, but there's also a very strong component that's related to our operating performance.
Brian Tyler: And then Ricky, this relative to the distribution of the vaccine itself, I mean, I guess probably best to just stick to the facts, I mean we've extended the U.S. government agreement to July of 2023. So to the extent, the U.S. government continues to acquire vaccines and make them available to the public. We will be there, the centralized distributor of those vaccines, should another model emerge and a distributor want to use commercial markets, obviously McKesson continues to have incredible vaccine capabilities in the commercial market as well. We're the leading distributor of the seasonal flu. We support the vaccines for children program. We've got great relationships with community providers all over the country, and we would obviously be anxious, ready and willing to support those commercial efforts as well.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please.
Operator: Next is Kevin Caliendo with UBS.
Kevin Caliendo: Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. So if I'm looking at the, the growth, just looking at revenue growth and the pharmaceutical segment and the med-surg segment, trying to back out the, the benefit of COVID just the guidance range, you apparently are growing faster than market you're raising numbers. Is this a macro thing, because we're not seeing utilization necessarily at the levels that you're growing at? Are you just in the right markets? Are you taking share, can you maybe talk about whether it's a competitive dynamics? Is it just that you're in ASCs and all the utilizations moving there on the med-surg side, what's driving your faster than market growth in those two segments?
Brian Tyler: Yes. Thanks for the question. Let me parse that out because I think there are some differences between the two segments. In the pharmaceutical segment, we did talk about improved utilization year-over-year. I think if you look at IQVIA [ph] numbers, you'll see that first quarter versus last year, there's approximately 7% growth in prescription transaction volume. So that is significant from what we've seen over the last few years. I also talked about in my remarks that within our U.S. pharmaceutical segment, we are seeing faster growth in our national, retail national account customers. So our largest accounts are growing faster than the market. And that's not something new to this quarter. We've talked about that now for the previous, four or five quarters. We have seen faster growth in those retail national account customers. In our medical business, we have a very strong primary care business and we've talked about the strength that we've had across all the channels and the breadth of products and services that continues. What we did see in the first quarter is really, what I would call an extended flu season. So we talked about higher level of illness in flu sales in the quarter. That was a part of the upside for medical in the first quarter. But overall it's the primary care business continuing to be quite robust and strong.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please.
Operator: Next is Eric Coldwell with Baird.
Eric Coldwell: Thanks. Can you hear me? Hello?
Operator: Yes, we can hear you.
Eric Coldwell: Yes, sorry. Thank you. Following on to an earlier question about the OpEx, SG&A control the incredible upside in that number. I guess my follow on or twist would be versus street gross margin was, I think also materially lower those two are offsets. We see this substantial variance in the, the P&L each and every quarter. I think where the streets just way too high on one number and way too low in the other, they offset and all as well. But I was hoping to get maybe a little more color on what in your mind, if you could think about where the street was, why would gross margin be perhaps lower than consensus expectations to a lesser extent than OpEx was upside, but what would be the major gross margin factors or things we should be considering moving forward?
Brian Tyler: Well, thanks for the question, Eric. I don't really want to try to project what's in the, the street models, but I will call out a couple things that I did talk about in remarks that I think could be a part of the disconnect, at least for the quarter. The cadence of our European divestiture activity could be a big part of that. We closed our UK retail and wholesale operations in April of 2022. And so when you look at the UK business in the Austrian businesses being divested that drove a significant Delta in gross profit and in operating expenses. In gross profit, if you could exclude the European divestitures, our gross profit to actually increase 9% that was in my initial remarks. The other thing that I would just go back to a prior comment, in our U.S. pharmaceutical segment, we are seeing faster growth from our retail national account customers. And those customers, as we've talked about in prior quarters have lower margins for us than the rest of our book, as you would expect that to have. So, again, our retail national account customers growing a little bit faster than the rest of the book that has a mix impact, but I think the big Delta in this quarter is really the timing and the cadence of these European divestitures.
Rachel Rodriguez: Okay. Next question, please.
Operator: Next will be Charles Rhyee with Cowen.
Charles Rhyee: Yes, thanks for – yes, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the prescription technology solutions. I recall the comments about, demand is strong and you can then make investments and I guess, what I looking at the guidance though, looks like the revenue growth though, is a little bit down. I might have missed it, but can you remind just mention, what's happening there? Obviously it looks like the – income guidance is up though. Just if you could just maybe clarify that a little bit?
Britt Vitalone: Yes. I'm happy to do that. We're very pleased with the performance in this segment, Brian talked about some of our solutions, our affordability solutions growth has been quite strong when you look at the revenue and the margin guidance versus our first quarter that is purely a result of mix. And so we would expect that our mix would be better as the year goes on. And it has a slight impact on the top line for certain products. So that is a function of mix, but overall, we're very pleased to be able to raise the guidance of profitability within that segment. And that kind of fits with, what we've been focused on, which is these higher growth, higher margin opportunities.
Brian Tyler: Yes, I think the key is the, the margin profile of the products and the services themselves is very stable, not improving, but the mix is a pure mix effects. And 3PL tends to be a high revenue, relatively low margin component of this business.
Rachel Rodriguez: We have time for one more question, please.
Operator: Certainly and that question will come from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good afternoon guys and congrats. Hey, good afternoon guys and congrats on the quarter. Brian, just since you touched on the Sarah Cannon partnership, just curious if you can maybe walk us through how you're thinking about, how that's going to drive growth and how strategically it fits going forward, and maybe the opportunities to expand that relationship with Sarah Cannon given, they're one of the largest cancer groups in the country.
Brian Tyler: Yes, sure. We're really excited about this. There were two parts to the acquisition. The first is the JV partnership with HCA, which brings Sarah Cannon and the USOR organizations together in the first instance, I'd say, they're both really very community provider facing organizations, both involved in clinical research. We think that community pharmacy and bringing, I mean, community oncology and bringing the community practices more prominently into clinical trials and the development of new medications is going to be important for all, overall health outcomes. So we look to see tremendous complementary across the brands, across the teams and really across the areas, we've each historically invested in. So we're really excited. We're excited to be partnered with HCA in this initiative. And the second component of that was the acquisition of an asset called Genospace. Really think about that as a complimentary data and analytics complement our other capabilities like Ontada, but this is going to help us do trial matching and recruiting, support clinical decision, support and really just become another component of this oncology ecosystem that we talk about. So we're really excited about this. We're obviously still, in the phase of waiting for regulatory approvals and pending closed, but we're really excited about this and as another important step in building out our community based oncology ecosystem.
Brian Tyler: Okay, Rachel that was it. Thanks. Well look, I mean, again, say thank you to everybody for taking time to join our call. Really, appreciate the thoughtful questions. I want to thank Justin for helping facilitate the call. I just wrap by reiterating, we had a really solid first quarter, total company revenue and adjusted earnings per diluted share. We're ahead of our expectations that we laid out in May. I remain confident, I know bridge shares my confidence in our resilient business model and our ability to deliver sustainable growth and generate attractive shareholder returns in FY 2023 and beyond. I want to end again by thanking Team McKesson for their unwavering focus and commitment to our vision, to our strategy and to each other. The support of a strong and dedicated team is the powerful driving force. That helps McKesson transform itself into a diversified healthcare services company and make a meaningful difference for all the patients we serve. Thanks again. I hope you all have a terrific evening.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

===== 2022 Q4  (2022-05-05 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to McKesson's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Rachel Rodriguez: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone, to McKesson's fourth quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. Today I’m joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session.  Today’s discussion will include forward-looking statements such as forecasts about McKesson’s operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today’s earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com and to the Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Information about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP results, can be found in today’s earnings release and presentation slides. The presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and updated guidance assumptions. With that, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Rachel, and good afternoon, everybody. Today, we announced our fourth quarter results, marking a solid finish to our strong fiscal 2022. Thanks to the dedication and excellent execution from Team McKesson, we made outstanding progress against our company priorities and in our transformation to a diversified health care services company. We achieved 31% growth in adjusted earnings per diluted share when excluding the impacts attributable to COVID-19 related items and net gains associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments. We have good momentum across the enterprise. We saw strength in our core distribution business and our strategic growth pillars of oncology and biopharma services. We remain focused on the company priorities, which are foundational to our sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value creation. My remarks today will be centered around these themes. Before I jump into company priorities, I do want to talk briefly about the recent developments in opioid litigation. In February, we announced the approval of the proposed opioid settlement agreement. 46 of the 49 eligible states and the District of Columbia and all eligible territories joined the settlement, representing more than 98% of the eligible political subdivisions that have brought opioid related suits against us as calculated by population under the agreement. The resolution delivers much needed relief for the impacted communities. It will collectively provide thousands of communities across the United States approximately $19.5 billion over 18 years. The agreement became effective on April 2nd. The approval of the settlement agreement also removed a significant portion of operational and financial uncertainty in the business, allowing us to redirect resources for more focused execution on our company strategies. In addition to the 46 states participating in the previously announced agreement, on April 4th, an agreement was reached in the Alabama matter, in which McKesson will pay $141 million and an additional $33 million in attorney's fees and costs to resolve the opioid related claims of the State of Alabama and its subdivisions. On May 3rd, an agreement was also reached in the Washington matter, in which McKesson will pay $197 million, consistent with the State of Washington's allocation under the previously announced comprehensive settlement framework, as well as certain additional attorney fees and costs. This resolution will result in the settlement of the state of Washington and its litigating subdivisions. That will bring the total number of states settling opioid-related claims with McKesson to 48 of 49 eligible states and the District of Columbia. As a company, we remain deeply concerned about the impact the opioid epidemic is having on individuals, on families and communities across the nation, and we continue to be committed to be part of the solution. This includes our controlled substance monitoring programs, advanced customer purchasing analytics and many, many other initiatives. Let me now take you through our company priorities and the progress we made in fiscal 2022. We are excited about these initiatives, as we continue to deliver strong results and improve our strength as an organization. After our fiscal 2022 discussion, I'll walk you through each of the operating segments and lay out how they are positioned for growth, as we head into fiscal 2023. For the last several years, the enterprise has centered its strategic, its operational and financial decisions around our set of company priorities and the results have been outstanding. We fundamentally changed the trajectory of the company from declining financial performance to sustainable growth across the business. Through the focused execution of the priorities, we improved efficiency, we defined our differentiated and strong market positions, and we established the right to play and win in oncology and the biopharma services markets. Now let me briefly walk you through the progress on each of them. I'll start with our first priority, which is our focus on people and culture, our ICARE values, our enterprise-first mindset and our commitment to Team McKesson, our commitment to each other, were critical to successfully navigating the last few years. We are committed to being the best place to work in health care, and our best talent strategy is accelerating our business momentum. In fiscal 2022, we made investments in our workforce including the frontline workers through additional labor investments in the US Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical segments in the back half of our fiscal year. Our company culture, our purpose, our mission and the investments we've made in our teams underpin our performance as a business. Our people and culture strategy is integrated with our continued focus on ESG initiatives, ensuring we not only do good business, but we do business the right way. As an impact-driven organization, we embrace our responsibility to enable lasting changes in the communities we serve. Over the past year, we made great progress in many areas, particularly around advancing access to care, health equity and climate action for health. To promote diversity, equity and inclusion, we have set specific and measurable goals to increase representation of both women and people of color amongst our leadership ranks. We released our employment information report, including our EEO-1 data, to improve transparency and accountability and equal employment opportunities. We also launched company-wide inclusion training, fostering positive behaviors and teaching ways to address bias in the workplace. Our commitment to diversity starts with our Board as evidenced by the recent successful completion of our Board refreshment. In April, we announced the election of Roy Dunbar as the new Director of the Board. Mr. Dunbar brings decades of experience in technology, operations and health care and will be instrumental in guiding the company's strategic priorities. In addition to the appointment of Mr. Dunbar, in fiscal 2022, we elected a new independent chair of the Board and introduced three other new board members with diverse backgrounds and experience. Women and people of color now represent 50% of our Board of Directors, and we look forward to benefiting from their leadership and their stewardship. Moving to our second priority, which is driving sustainable core growth. At the core of our offering is the Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical distribution solutions. Building upon the momentum in fiscal 2022, we continue to innovate and invest in our distribution assets and capabilities. Some of the latest advancements over the past year include automated picking and packing solutions and robotics, which help us improve productivity, so we can pick more accurately, pack medications faster and ultimately serve our customers better. We're also expanding the reach of our core business by entering adjacent markets while maintaining operational excellence. A great example of this is our patient home delivery service. Leveraging our scale distribution network, we help our partners deliver medical-surgical products directly to patients' homes nationwide. With an increasing demand in virtual and home care, we've seen significant growth in this channel in the past few years. Our best-in-class customer service and deep medical-surgical products enables us to capture the market opportunity, ensuring the right product to the right patient at the right time. We also continued to partner closely with the US government in its COVID-19 response effort. It's been more than a year now since we started shipping the COVID-19 vaccine and ancillary supplies. Through March 31, we have successfully distributed over 380 million Moderna and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines to administration sites across the United States and in support of the US government's international donation mission. Although the contract with the US government to serve as a centralized distributor is expected to end in July, this experience has been a strong testimony to our vast and scaled supply chain capabilities. And I am incredibly proud of the way our employees rose to the challenges brought on by the pandemic through our focus on meeting the needs of the healthcare community. In early fiscal 2022, we announced our intent to exit the European market, which aligns with our company priority to streamline and simplify the business. Over the past 12 months, we've made significant progress as we have successfully entered into agreements to sell the operations in 10 of the 12 countries. We've completed the divestiture of the Austria and UK businesses, and our German joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance, bringing all the in-process transactions to closure and exploring strategic alternatives for the remaining countries is a top priority in fiscal 2023. The actions we're taking in Europe build upon our deliberate efforts over the past years to maximize the organization's operational efficiency and focus our resources on the highest growth opportunities. The last company priority that we're excited about is the expansion of our oncology and biopharma services ecosystem. At our Investor Day in December 2021, we shared details about our differentiated assets and capabilities in these two areas. We believe that these ecosystems can help solve complicated problems, and importantly, improve patients' lives. The goal to help ease the frictions and eliminate inefficiencies in the healthcare system and to improve patients' lives is what motivates us continuously to innovate and to execute. Our biopharma ecosystem represents a scaled network of assets and capabilities that are highly differentiated. Within the ecosystem, we're expanding the reach of our products and services that aim to improve access, affordability and adherence. In the past year, we helped patients save more than $6 billion on branded and specialty medications. We helped prevent more than 9 million prescriptions from being abandoned due to affordability challenges, and we helped patients act their medicine more than 67 million times. We created an ecosystem that's more efficient and more valuable to the customers and patients and each of the pieces would be standing alone. The cohesive business strategy and coordinated go-to-market solutions are both critical enabling continued growth in this segment. In our oncology ecosystem, we're strategically positioned to improve cancer care with a range of services and solutions. Our distribution and GPO capabilities continue to provide patients access to life-saving drugs, including biosimilars. Combined with our reach through the US oncology network, we help promote awareness and bring more affordable treatment options to both providers and patients. A great example is our US oncology research, which continues to play a central role in accelerating research and science. As one of the largest community based oncology research programs, it has contributed to more than 100 FDA approved cancer therapies. Last year, nearly 900 physicians actively accrued patients to clinical trial. And through Ontada, we're leveraging the reach and resources across the ecosystem to generate real-world data and evidence. We've published more than 200 real-world studies and leading industry publications for over 70 oncology indications. We are now serving the top 15 global life sciences companies, providing them valuable services to accelerate research and commercialization. As I reflect on our progress against the company priorities, I am very excited to see the meaningful impact it's brought to our business, our customers and to patients. The strategy is working and will continue McKesson's growth journey into fiscal 2023. I'm confident in our ability to continuously execute, innovate and deliver sustainable profit growth for the long-term. Now let me turn to the performance over the past 12 months and how we're positioned for success heading into fiscal 2023. First, I want to share an exciting update on our ESG initiatives. At the beginning of fiscal 2022, we committed to set science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets. We have already submitted our targets to the Science Based Targets initiative for official validation. Through initiatives across operations and supply chain management, we're setting measurable and specific goals to reduce both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, building a more sustainable business, and ultimately, serving the health of patients and communities. Next, let me provide some observations on volume and utilization trends. We're encouraged by the prescription volume and medical visit levels across the business. We've seen continued improvement in pharmaceutical prescription volume, oncology visits and primary care patient visits. While recovery in certain markets like extended care may be lagging, we are seeing other markets recover close to pre-COVID levels. We anticipate the positive trends to continue in fiscal 2023. In US Pharmaceutical, we saw stability in the distribution fundamentals reflected in solid growth in adjusted operating profit in fiscal 2022. Our ability to drive sustainable growth in this business derives from a few factors. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to invest in the core distribution assets expanding and strengthening our capabilities and unlocking new efficiencies in the business. On the generics and branded front, the fundamentals of the pricing environment remains stable and generally track in line with our expectations. Our balanced approach of managing a broad portfolio of pharmaceutical products allows us to strengthen our competitive position and enables us to be resilient and flexible to market movements. We remain focused on the investment and expansion of our oncology ecosystem. We're pleased with the growth momentum across our oncology assets from Provider Solutions in the US oncology network to our data and our insights business Ontada. They are critical pieces to the long-term growth of this segment, and we're excited to capture the market opportunity and further our progress in fiscal 2023. In Prescription Technology Solutions, we saw another year of adjusted operating profit growth, driven by expansion of our product offerings, as we bring more brands onto the platform and increase transaction volume as the market recovered. A good example of growth in this segment is our access for more patients, or AMP solution, which was developed and launched about three years ago. The solution's focused on automating benefit verification and hub enrollments for patients. And in fiscal 2022, we saw accelerated growth with 25% increase in the number of brands on the program. It has contributed to the overall growth across the enterprise and more importantly, help patients get on therapies up to eight days faster and stay on therapies longer, driving better health outcomes. We anticipate innovations like this will continue to fuel growth and strengthen our differentiated product offerings. Our future innovations and investments will be centered around expanding the reach of our current products into adjacent markets, such as specialty brands and medical benefits. We continue to invest into the future growth of this segment. Moving on to Medical-Surgical, which has performed exceedingly well this past year. Excluding the benefit from COVID-19 items, the underlying Medical-Surgical Distribution business grew at a double-digit rate for adjusted operating profit. The lab business that we highlighted before is just one of the drivers for this outstanding growth trajectory. Recovery in the primary care market and our expansion of selling prescription drugs into the non-acute channel also contributed to the segment. Looking ahead, as a leader in the alternate site market, we believe that this segment is well positioned, as more site of care moves into the communities. Our experience and our relationships in every channel and setting of the alternate site markets enable us to capture this growth opportunity in the years ahead. In the International segment, our strategy and commitment to the Canadian operations remains unchanged. McKesson Canada is a leader in pharmaceutical distribution in the country and has a portfolio of valuable assets, including the retail banner groups Rexall, specialty pharmacies and digital offerings such as Well.ca. We will continue to build and grow this business. In summary, we're extremely pleased with the progress we've made in fiscal 2022 to further our transformation into a diversified health care services company. Looking ahead, to our fiscal 2023, our guidance of $22.90 to $23.60 of adjusted earnings per diluted share includes organic growth of the underlying businesses, improved operating leverage and a balanced approach to capital deployment. Excluding the contribution from COVID-19-related items in both fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, and net gains from McKesson Ventures in fiscal 2022, we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to grow 9% to 14% year-over-year. We expect the adjusted operating profit growth in our US Pharmaceutical, Prescription Technology and Medical-Surgical segments to be in line or above the long-term financial framework we laid out at our Investor Day last December. We anticipate the market to remain dynamic, particularly as it relates to supply chain and inflation. We're confident in the resiliency of our business model and our ability to minimize any potential impacts. Our fiscal 2023 guidance does not assume a material headwind from supply chain disruption or sustained price inflation. Britt will walk you through the additional details that we've included in the outlook. As we look ahead to fiscal 2023 we're excited and energized to build on the momentum and to capitalize on our strong market position. We're advancing our transformation to a diversified healthcare services company, extending our long tradition of innovation and evolving our business while reaffirming our strong commitment to addressing the changing needs of our customers, their patients and the broader healthcare industry. Our success in building differentiated assets and capabilities positions us well to support better health outcomes and to accelerate profitability and healthy growth for the company. I want to conclude my remarks by acknowledging our employees, who are dedicated to bringing insight products and services to our customers and partners. Thanks to their execution and their commitment to McKesson and to each other, we're improving care in every setting, one product, one partner and one patient at a time. We are truly enabling better health for all. Thank you for your time this afternoon. And now I'm going to hand it over to Britt.
Britt Vitalone: Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2022 results, then I'll outline our fiscal 2023 guidance. At our Investor Day in December, we discussed the transformation underway at McKesson. Distribution remains a core part of our company. However, we continue to advance and grow as a diversified health care services company, built on differentiated assets and strategies we're executing, delivering sustainable earnings growth across our businesses. As we articulated then, our confidence is based on three interconnected factors: the successful focus to advance McKesson's oncology and biopharma services ecosystem; leveraging our best-in-class assets and capabilities; effective allocation of capital, including streamlining our portfolio; and the momentum we've been generating through operating and working capital execution. We remain confident that we'll achieve the long-term targets that we've provided for fiscal 2023 and beyond. Let me start by discussing our focus to streamline the portfolio with an update on Europe. In early fiscal 2022, we announced our strategic intent to exit the European region. The transaction to complete a full exit of our European operations allow McKesson to streamline the portfolio, aligning future investments to our growth strategies in North America. We've made good progress. We remain committed to this set of actions. In July of 2021, we announced the transaction with the PHOENIX Group to sell operations in six countries and other certain assets. The transaction is proceeding well. We anticipate it will close in the second half of fiscal 2023. We have successfully closed the following transactions. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we completed the sale of our Austrian business to Quadrifolia management, and the sale of McKesson's remaining share of our German joint venture to Walgreens Boots Alliance. Recently, we completed the sale of McKesson's UK retail and distribution businesses to AURELIUS, which closed on April 6. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we recorded a GAAP-only charge of $343 million related to our agreement to sell the UK retail and distribution business. Finally, we continue to explore strategic alternatives to exit our remaining operations in Norway and Denmark. In fiscal 2022, our European operations, including held-for-sale accounting treatment impacts, contributed $409 million of adjusted operating profit or $1.97 per diluted share. For fiscal 2023, we anticipate our remaining European operations will contribute approximately $0.85 to $1.15, which includes accretion resulting from the held-for-sale accounting for the transaction for the PHOENIX Group. As I mentioned on our third quarter earnings call, we intend to deploy capital through share repurchases to offset the dilution resulting from the European divestitures. Let me now move to a review of our fiscal 2022 results. My comments today will refer to our adjusted results on a year-over-year basis, unless I state otherwise. Fiscal 2022 was another year of strong execution for McKesson. We're exiting the year with solid operating performance, delivering fiscal 2022 fourth quarter earnings per share of $5.83, and for the full year, earnings per share of $23.69. Our full year results included revenue and profit growth across every business segment. In addition to growth in our core businesses, fiscal 2022 earnings per diluted share also included the following three items. The first is $1.79 related to the US government's centralized COVID-19 vaccine and kitting distribution program, which included $0.89 related to COVID-19 vaccine distribution and $0.90 related to the kitting, distribution and storage of ancillary supplies. $0.88 was related to COVID-19 tests, and finally, $0.47 related to net gains associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments. Excluding these items and the impact of fiscal 2021 inventory impairment charges related to personal protective equipment and other related products, fiscal 2022 earnings per diluted share increased 31% year-over-year. For the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues of $66.1 billion increased 12%, driven by growth in the US Pharmaceutical segment due to increased volumes of specialty products, including higher volumes from retail national account customers and market growth, partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Gross profit was $3.4 billion for the quarter, an increase of 6%, primarily driven by our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, resulting from prior year inventory charges on PPE and related products, and increases in patient care visits in our primary care business. Gross profit was also positively impacted by increased volume with new and existing customers in our Prescription Technology Solutions segment. Operating expenses in the quarter increased 4% due to increased volumes in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, which were partially offset by the impact of held-for-sale accounting on announced divestitures in the International segment. Operating profit of $1.2 billion for the quarter was an increase of 3%, led by solid operating performance across the segments, partially offset by the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies for the U.S. government and lower contribution related to COVID-19 tests. When excluding the impact related to the distribution of COVID-19 related products, net gains associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments and the prior year PPE impairments in the Medical-Surgical segment, operating profit increased 8%. Moving below the line, interest expense was $43 million in the quarter, a decrease of 17% due to the net retirement of approximately $1.1 billion of long-term debt in fiscal 2022, including a previously announced tender offer in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Our tax rate was 21.9% for the quarter. And ramping up our consolidated results, fourth quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 149.2 million, a decrease of 7% year-over-year resulting from share repurchases throughout fiscal 2022. Moving now to fiscal fourth quarter and full year segment results, which can be found on slides seven through 12. And starting with US Pharmaceutical. Revenues were $53.7 billion, an increase of 14%, driven by increased volume of specialty products, including higher volumes from retail national account customers and market growth, partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Operating profit decreased 4% to $780 million, due to lower demand of COVID-19 vaccine distribution, partially offset by growth in distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems. The contribution from our contract with the US government for the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines declined sequentially, and as demand continued to lessen along with continued easing of COVID-19 restrictions. COVID-19 vaccine distribution provided a benefit of approximately $0.06 per share in the fourth quarter, compared to $0.26 in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. As a reminder, fiscal fourth quarter operating profit growth included previously announced investments made in response to the competitive labor market. On our earnings call in February, we reiterated our expectation for additional labor-related expenses to ensure continued service continuity through the second half of our fiscal year. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution and the previously outlined labor investments, the US Pharmaceutical segment delivered operating profit growth of 4%. For the full year, operating profit increased 8% to $2.9 billion, driven by growth in distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems and the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution. In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, revenues were $1 billion, an increase of 29%, as a result of volume growth related to biopharma services, including third-party logistics services and increased technology service revenue, partially resulting from the growth of prescription volumes. Operating profit increased 11% to $162 million, driven by growth from access and adherence solutions. For the full year, operating profit was $590 million, an increase of 26%. Next, Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $2.9 billion, an increase of 6% due to growth in the primary care business. Operating profit increased 55% to $298 million. In the fourth quarter, operating profit in the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment included $0.22 of earnings per diluted share contribution related to COVID-19 tests and $0.20 of earnings per share -- per diluted share contribution related to the kitting, distribution and storage of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines for the US government. Excluding the impacts of these COVID-19 related items, and the prior year inventory charge on PPE-related products, operating profit increased 26% due to growth in the primary care business. For the full year, operating profit increased 50% to $1.2 billion. When excluding the impacts of COVID-19-related items and prior year inventory charges on PPE and related products, operating profit increased 22%. During the fourth quarter, COVID-19 and the direction of the disease continued to demonstrate variability. The demand for COVID-19-related products and services has fluctuated over the course of the pandemic. However, the direction generally followed the volume of COVID-19 case levels. Forecasting COVID-19 vaccine distribution and testing demand more than a few months at a time remains difficult. We continue to track new guidance and variants. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we experienced increased demand in January related to a spike in cases due to the Omicron variant. We experienced a 60% volume increase related to COVID-19 tests in January, compared to the average in the third quarter. In February and March, COVID cases declined month-over-month with a corresponding decline in COVID test volumes. In March, we experienced approximately a 90% decrease related to COVID-19 test volumes, compared to the third quarter average. The declines in February and March led to lower earnings contribution from COVID-19 tests in our fiscal fourth quarter. We anticipate that the pace of COVID test volume and vaccine demand will follow a similar fluctuating pattern in fiscal 2023, and we anticipate that fiscal 2023 COVID volume and earnings per share contribution will be materially lower than fiscal 2022. Let me address our international results. Revenues were $8.5 billion on a reported basis. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues were $8.8 billion, an increase of 3%, driven by sales to new customers in the Canadian business and year-over-year volume recovery in our distribution businesses, partially offset by the divestiture of our Austrian business, which closed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Operating profit increased 7% to $147 million. On an FX adjusted basis, operating profit increased 10% to $152 million due to the reduction of depreciation and amortization on European assets under agreements to sell and increased volumes in the pharmaceutical distribution business. For the full year, operating profit on an FX-adjusted basis increased 40%. And in our Corporate segment, expenses were $183 million in the quarter, an increase of 46%. During the quarter, mark-to-market valuations related to our equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio resulted in net losses of approximately $6 million, compared to net gains of $44 million in fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Corporate expenses were $579 million for the full year, which were approximately flat compared to the prior year. In fiscal 2022, McKesson had net gains related to our equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio of approximately $98 million or $0.47 per share. This compares to net gains of approximately $132 million or $0.60 for the full year of fiscal 2021. As a reminder, our McKesson Ventures portfolio holds equity investments in several growth-stage digital health and services companies, and we are pleased with the insights and the portfolio results that we've obtained. The impacts for a consolidated financials can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment quarter-to-quarter. And as a result, McKesson's investments may result in gains or losses, the timing and magnitude of which can vary to reach investment. It's difficult to predict when gains and losses on our venture portfolio companies may occur. And, therefore, our practice has been and will continue to not include ventures portfolio estimates in our guidance. And finally, in the fourth quarter, we incurred opioid related litigation expenses of $26 million and incurred $130 million for the full year fiscal 2022. Turning now to our cash position and capital deployment on slide 13. For the fiscal year, we generated $3.9 billion in free cash flow, which included $535 million of capital expenditures. We continue to focus capital deployment to drive value for our shareholders. Since fiscal 2018 we returned $11 billion of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Of this amount, over $9 billion has been returned through share repurchases, reducing our total average shares outstanding by nearly 31%. In fiscal 2022, we returned $3.5 billion through share repurchases, including $1.5 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter. Additionally, we paid dividends of $277 million for the full year. When combining share repurchases with dividends paid, we returned approximately 97% of free cash flow to shareholders in fiscal 2022. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation, along with disciplined capital allocation, continues to provide us with the financial flexibility to invest in our strategies, pursue strategic opportunities and return capital to shareholders, all while maintaining a strong capital structure. Let me spend a few minutes now discussing our outlook for fiscal 2023. We entered fiscal 2023 with solid momentum, building upon the strong fiscal 2022 results. Rather than outlining each assumption, I'll instead walk you through the key items, beginning with additional details of fiscal 2023 consolidated guidance. A full list of our assumptions can be found on slides 14 through 19 in our supplemental slide presentation. We remain confident in the fundamentals of our North American health care services and distribution businesses. We'll continue to invest in innovative product offerings that further enhance our leading roles in the oncology and biopharma services ecosystem. Our fiscal 2023 guidance assumes flat to 4% reported revenue growth and 4% to 10% operating profit decline compared to fiscal 2022. Excluding the impacts related to the US government's centralized COVID-19 vaccine and kitting distribution programs, COVID-19 tests and net gains associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments, which were recorded in fiscal year 2022, we anticipate operating profit to increase 3% to 9%. We anticipate a full year tax rate of approximately 18% to 20%, and corporate expenses in the range of $520 million to $590 million. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we finalized the broad settlement of opioid-related claims of states and municipalities. While we've reached a broad settlement, there are cases that remain open. As it relates to opioid litigation expenses, we previously communicated that we anticipate a substantial reduction in fiscal year 2023 resulting from the settlement. For fiscal 2023, our current approximation is $40 million, and it can vary based on a number of factors, including remaining nongovernmental suits, trials and pace of legal proceedings, and we'll continue to update you accordingly. Wrapping up our consolidated guidance, our fiscal 2023 earnings per diluted share outlook is $22.90 to $23.60, which includes $0.20 to $0.60 of contribution attributable to the following COVID-19-related items: $0.05 to $0.20 related to the US government's vaccine distribution; less than $0.05 related to the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies; and $0.15 to $0.35 related to COVID-19 tests. Excluding the impacts of these COVID-19 related items from both fiscal 2023 guidance and fiscal 2022 results and the $0.47 related to net gains associated with the McKesson Ventures equity investments in FY 2022, our fiscal 2023 guidance indicates approximately 9% to 14% growth over the prior year. This estimated year-over-year growth is consistent with the long-term financial targets that we provided at our December Investor Day event and represents solid organic growth in our underlying businesses, disciplined capital deployment and continued expansion of our oncology and biopharma services ecosystem. Moving now to our segments. In the US Pharmaceutical segment, our outlook reflects the efficiency and durability of our core distribution platform and continued expansion of our oncology ecosystem. We anticipate reported revenue to increase 7% to 10% and operating profit to approximately be flat to 4% decline year-over-year. Our outlook includes approximately $0.05 to $0.20 related to COVID-19 vaccine distribution for the US government in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, which is aligned to the current contract timing and volume distribution schedule provided by the CDC and the US government. This compares to $0.89 in full year fiscal 2022. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution for the US government, we anticipate 3% to 5% operating profit growth, which is consistent with the long-term growth target we provided for the US Pharmaceutical segment at our recent Investor Day event. In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we anticipate revenue growth of 17% to 23% and operating profit growth of 14% to 20%. This outlook reflects momentum organic growth across our solutions and services as we expand partnerships with biopharma manufacturers, generate higher transaction volume and increase the number of brands under access and adherence platforms. In the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, we anticipate reported revenues to decrease 7% to 11% and operating profit to decrease 15% to 21%. Our outlook includes approximately less than $0.05 related to beginning storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the US government. And this compares to $0.90 in fiscal 2022. As a reminder, our contracts with the US government are scheduled to end in July of 2022. We also anticipate approximately $0.15 to $0.35 related to COVID-19 tests in fiscal 2023. Excluding the impact of these COVID-19-related items, we anticipate operating profit to increase 8% to 14%, primarily as a result of growth in the primary care business. The Medical-Surgical business remains well-positioned to leverage the breadth and depth of its services throughout the alternate site market, including growth from laboratory solutions and the government sector. Finally, in the International segment, we anticipate reported revenues to decline by 34% to 38% and operating profit to decline by 22% to 28%. This year-over-year decrease includes the loss of operating profit contribution from businesses and transactions we've closed to date and that we expect to close during fiscal 2023. In Canada, we have a strong position as the leader in health care distribution. We anticipate continued organic growth in our pharmaceutical distribution business, including strategic sourcing efforts. Let me conclude our fiscal 2023 outlook with a few comments on cash flow and capital deployment. As I communicated at Investor Day, our capital allocation strategy prioritizes strategic growth, complemented by a return of capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and a modest yet growing dividend. Our investment-grade credit rating remains a priority and underpins our financial flexibility. This flexibility positions us for the continuation of sustainable long-term value creation for our shareholders. In fiscal 2023, we anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses. As a reminder, our working capital metrics and resulting cash flows vary from quarter-to-quarter, impacted by timing, which could include the timing of planned European divestiture activity. As discussed at Investor Day, we intend to offset the dilution related to our European divestitures with capital deployment. As indicated on slide 18, our fiscal 2023 outlook incorporates plans to repurchase approximately $3.5 billion of shares. A significant portion of the share buyback assumption is associated with offsetting the year-over-year impact of European divestitures. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2023 to be in the range of approximately $142 million to $144 million. The progress we're making across our strategic priorities, including our commitment to streamline the business, supports our strong cash flow. This cash flow provides us with the flexibility to deploy capital through organic and inorganic investments in our business and returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In closing, fiscal 2022 was another strong year for McKesson. We continue to make great progress on our transformative journey, from a distribution-focused company to a leading diversified health care services company, accelerating and expanding our oncology and biopharma services ecosystem. Our strategies are working, and we're delivering for our customers, partners, patients and our shareholders. We are well positioned to capture the vast opportunities in the growing markets of oncology and biopharma services. We have a strong financial outlook and our financial framework and execution position us to deliver sustainable profit growth, cash flows and shareholder value creation. We have great confidence in our teams, in our products and services and in our strategy. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Michael Cherny with Bank of America.
Michael Cherny: Good afternoon and thanks for obviously a ton of details. So I want to think about just the cadence of the year, if I can, a little bridge, just to make sure. Should we assume, based on the timing of the CDC contract, that pharma growth should be heavier in the first quarter of the year? And how should we think about any other components of cadence and how it should filter through the year relative to some of the more identifiable items like the COVID benefits and other components?
Britt Vitalone: Yes. Thanks for that question, Mike. As we didn't really outline it, we don't talk about quarterly guidance, but I can indicate for you that on a consolidated basis, what we would expect is that our earnings growth will be heavier in the second half of the year as opposed to the first half of the year. As I laid out in my comments, we have less contribution from COVID related items in fiscal 2023 than we did in fiscal 2022. And in fact, in all cases, across both Pharma and our Medical segment, we have declining COVID related contribution. So what we do expect is that we would indicate to you expect a heavier proportion of earnings in the second half of the year, a modestly heavier proportion in the second half of the year than the first half.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Eric Percher: Thank you. Brian and Britt, kind of, standard question on initial guidance. As you've looked at your budget for the year, I'd be interested to hear what the risks and opportunities look like, recognizing you have a $0.70 range on $23 and potentially $0.40 of that attributable to COVID. So you're feeling that there's relatively little variance and what are the factors that would drive you high or low?
Britt Vitalone: Thanks for the question, Eric. I'll start, and then certainly, Brian can add on. I think one thing for sure as we think about this is as we talked about the variability that we've seen in COVID and the pace of COVID is certainly one that we'll watch for and that certainly can go up or down, particularly in the case of COVID tests. So that could be a risk. It could be a positive or a negative. Clearly, as we've talked about with the macro environment, we are pleased with the fact that we're seeing prescription volumes continue to increase. And as the economy continues to -- or I should say, if patients continue to be more mobile as COVID restrictions continue to ease, that certainly is an opportunity for us to see prescription volumes continue to improve, not only in our Pharma business, but really across, as I talked about, in our Prescription Technology business as well. We certainly have the opportunity to deploy capital. We've laid out for you our assumptions around capital deployment, but we have a lot of flexibility and a good financial framework. And the other way I would point out to you is really the timing around our European divestitures. We've laid out for you that we would expect the transaction with the Phoenix Group to be in the second half of the year, but clearly, that timing could move as we continue to move through that transaction.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen.
Charles Rhyee: Thanks for taking the question. Britt, you talked about how your COVID related businesses really tracks with the incidence of COVID in the country. We are seeing cases rise, at least to date, that's what the data seems to be showing. But at the same time, right, it seems like there's overall less testing sort of a less emphasis. Maybe you can talk about maybe trends that you're seeing currently? And what does an endemic phase of COVID look like, or how are you guys thinking about that as we think -- if we move into an endemic phase for COVID? Thanks.
Brian Tyler: Thanks, Charles. It's -- obviously, it's been a little bit hard to predict over the last two years. We saw our last spike in testing really hit us in January of this year. And then we've seen COVID test kit volumes fall off pretty significantly since then. There is a new variant circulating. Initial indications are as probably the same medical profile as the previous variant. But the wild card will be patient behavior. Do people get into routine testing? Do they feel the need to routinely test? Do employers test, as they bring people back? And that's a little bit difficult to forecast. So what we've given you is a guide in FY 2023, based on our most -- our best and current view of the market.
Britt Vitalone: And, Charles, maybe just getting back to the question that Eric asked as we think over the year, things that could get us to the higher or the low end of the range. Clearly, COVID test has a lot of variability in that. We've given you our best estimate based on the trends that we've seen, which is really that, as Brian talked about, that declining level of cases in testing. But, certainly, if a variant does come back and cases begin to rise again, that would be something that we would watch for. And we would anticipate that COVID testing would follow the trajectory of cases.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Ms. Gill, please check your mute button on your…
Brian Tyler: Hi, Lisa. Are you there?
Lisa Gill: Sorry, I’m here. Thank you very much for all the detail. I just want to understand a couple of things, as we think about the guidance. One, I know you made a comment earlier on when we think about supply chain and inflation that you have some things built into your guidance. You talked about the inflation on the side of wage inflation. One, could you carry that through into 2023 on a permanent basis? And then secondly, if I think about your medical supply business, you have historically had a private label product that was coming, if I remember correctly, from Asia. So has there been any impact due to supply constraints on that side of the business?
Brian Tyler: Thanks for the question. I'll kick it off and Britt can add whatever additional comments he'd like. I mean, starting on the labor cost front. It's obviously been a pretty dynamic labor market, and we don't actually think of it as a single market. We think of it as micro markets around where we have locations and facilities. We did make investments largely into the frontline teams in our Medical and our Pharmaceutical business in the back half of our last fiscal year. We've talked about that, and we have contemplated some labor investments in our FY 2023 outlook, based on the status of the market today and the behaviors and the indicators that we see today. That’s something we’ll continue to track. I mean, I think, McKesson is a great place to work. We have a really strong employee value proposition that includes competitive wages, the benefits and development and career progression and mean -- and work that has really meaning and purpose behind it. So I think we feel good about where we stand as we enter the year, but it's certainly -- the last several months have been, labor markets like most of us have not seen, so we'll continue to monitor and track that closely. On the supply chain front, I think our supply chains have been remarkably resilient in Medical and Pharmaceutical over the many, many twists of the last two years, I would say that they continue to be resilient. We would anticipate very modest levels of disruption and cost inflation in FY 2023. Our private brand program, as you might recall, we don't own physical plant and equipment and manufacture, we source. And so our teams have been very aggressively thinking about expanding and broadening and rotating our sources of supply. And thus far, we've been able to maintain very good inventory positions.
Britt Vitalone: And maybe just Lisa, I'd just add on, we have a very comprehensive sourcing strategy and we source our products really in a very diverse way across many different countries. And one of the things that we're really proud about and focused on is our approach to responsible and sustainable sourcing. And we've really taken a lot of actions along those lines to also diversify our partners across the products that we serve. So we feel like we have really good strong sourcing program in place, and we feel well-positioned.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question please.
Operator: And our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays.
Steven Valiquette: Thanks. Good afternoon everybody. So relative to our own EPS bridge we had built previously from FY 2022 to 2023, biggest source of upside from our view is the $0.85 to $1.15 EPS you still expect from the European assets. I guess in that piece, I was curious, too, is there any color on whether or not that will be heavily front-end loaded in the first quarter or two or maybe more evenly spread throughout the year? And then at the risk of maybe looking too far ahead, should we assume that all of that $0.85 to above $15 would essentially disappear in your fiscal 2024? Thanks.
Britt Vitalone: Yeah, I'd say that the cadence would be very similar to what I gave you on a consolidated basis. Now we do expect that the transaction that we talked about with PHOENIX is going to close in the second half of fiscal 2023. So I guess it would be more first three quarters loaded than just half-and-half. As it relates to 2024, I think it’s little early to start talking about that. We've talked to you about the fact that Norway and Denmark are still two countries that we're evaluating opportunities for to fully exit this. It's too early to really talk about any transactions along those lines. And we still operate those businesses, and we’ll just continue to evaluate opportunities to exit that. But those are -- those continue to be countries that we operate in.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser: Yeah, hi. Good afternoon. So two clarification questions. So one, as we think about the European contribution, I think that's page 16 in your slide deck that $1.97. Is the take here is really that, that European contribution ultimately will be replaced by buybacks even for that, I think you have $0.85 to $1.15 in assets that you still own. But if you divest tender, we should think about this as replaceable with capital allocation through buybacks. And then similar to that, if we think about the cost inflation that's embedded in results. I think in the slides you talked about, if you adjust for COVID costs then distribution segment would have grown 2%. I think on the call, you said if you adjust for that, aim for higher rate in inflation, then you would have grown 4%. So should we think about that 2% difference is the cost and inflation? Is this something that we can think about as we try to quantify what it is embedded in your 2023 guidance?
Britt Vitalone: Thanks for the questions, Ricky. Let me try to take those in order. Let me first talk about Europe. We've tried to lay out here for you as transparently as we could what the European contribution was in FY 2022. And then we talked about what we thought the operations would contribute in 2023. We fully intend to exit Europe. And what we've also said is that when we do that, the loss contribution from those earnings, we would replace with capital deployment, principally share, share buybacks. And we've tried to lay that out for you. And so, yes, the way we've laid it out for you is that you should think about Europe eventually going away and being replaced by capital deployment. As it relates to the comment on the US Pharmaceutical segment, let me break it up this way. When you think about excluding the COVID-related items, which, again, we've talked about those pretty transparently since the beginning, we had 2% growth year-over-year. We did talk about beginning on our second quarter earnings call that we were making additional investments into our US-based businesses to have continuity of service through labor expenses. That accounted for about 2% of the year-over-year impact in the US Pharmaceutical business in the fourth quarter. And so, I wanted just to make that comment. It's nothing different than we've talked about before. We talked about the contribution that we'll be making and the investment we'd be making about $0.20 for the year. That, for the US Pharmaceutical segment, was about 2% in the quarter. So that's why we called that out, just as a sort of a confirmation of what we've talked about previously.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please?
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Kevin Caliendo with UBS.
Kevin Caliendo: Thanks for taking my question. Just a lot of the margin changed the guidance and the change in margins across the segments can be explained by COVID. But when I look at, say, PTS and Medical-Surgical, is there anything else we should think about in terms of the mix or benefits? You've talked a little bit about what you expect on the pharma side. Is there anything in those two segments outside of COVID that we should be thinking about that might impact margins for 2023?
Britt Vitalone: As we think about 2023, wouldn't think that there would be much change in terms of the mix within those two businesses. We're continuing to see good strength in our primary care business in the medical business. We expect that will continue into FY 2023. And in our RxTS business, I mean, we had strong growth on the revenue line, we had 26% growth in operating profit. So we had strong performance at the margin line as well. And we expect that our adherence and access programs will continue to have growth as we move into 2023. So I wouldn't guide you to any different mix in 2023 than we’ve seen in 2022.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell with R.W. Baird.
Eric Coldwell: Hi. Thank you. Good afternoon. Fairly simple one, I hope. Your competitor who reported today had $115 million of opioid expense last year, said that their expense next year would be down only modestly. You had $130 million expense, and you're saying it will be $40 million. That's a really big delta between the two companies for the same situation. Any sense on what the delta is between you two? Have you excluded the injunctive relief costs, the data, the tracking, the integrity costs that come with the program in this $40 million, or what might explain this substantial delta in opioid litigation expense? Thanks very much.
Brian Tyler: I don't know that we can speak to the delta. We can speak to the guidance that we provided. As we look at the litigation, the litigation calendar, open issues that are ahead of us. This is our best view based on what we know today of what we would anticipate to spend and defending ourselves against these suits. And that number we provided was $40 million.
Britt Vitalone: And as I pointed out, there are some factors that could drive that number in either direction. That could be the pace of any trials or trials themselves and any of the work that goes into any trials that do happen. So we've given you our best estimate based on our analysis of what remains. And again, as Brian said, it's really can't comment on how is somebody else is thinking about this.
Brian Tyler: That is the legal expense. I mean that is $40 million for legal defense, right?
Britt Vitalone: Consistent as it's been since we began reporting this to you three years ago.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I was wondering if you could talk about the relative contribution of pricing increases to the revenue growth in your three remaining segments and the outlook that you provided for 2023?
Britt Vitalone: Yeah, thanks for the question. We didn't touch on that. We historically have talked about the environment around branded inflation and generic inflation. We don't see any change in our FY 2023 outlook to what we've seen in FY 2022. So we see relative stability in both branded price inflation. And from a generics perspective, we continue to see a stable but competitive environment that is supported by the strong sourcing operations that we have and our focus is on providing our customers, stability of supply, good pricing and our ability to do that through good sourcing and disciplined approach to the sell side. So from our perspective, as we look at the pricing environments around branded and generics, we see relative stability in 2023 compared to 2022.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.
George Hill: Hey good evening guys, and I appreciate you taking my question. I guess, Britt, I would ask if you could talk a little bit about inside of the Pharmaceutical segment, kind of, the difference between what's happening in the core wholesaling business versus the more manufacturer facing services businesses? And I guess, are they both performing in line and positively, or is there a meaningful divergence on how the -- what I would call the pharmacy facing business is performing versus the manufacturer facing business is performing?
Britt Vitalone: Yeah. Let me start, and then certainly, Brian can add on to this. Our biopharma services, I think, as you've captured on manufacturer services, those businesses are captured in our Rx Solutions segment. And as we've talked about, that business continues to generate really good revenue, top line and profit growth. We're seeing more brands being added to our platforms. We're seeing good acceptance in the marketplace of our access and adherence solutions. In both of our businesses, as I talked about, we're seeing improved transaction volume from prescriptions. And that certainly is benefiting our Prescription Technology Solutions segment very well, both new and existing brand. So I'd say both of those businesses are benefiting from the macro factors of seeing improved transaction volumes. Clearly, the growth of our technology solutions in RXTS and our access and adherence solutions are seeing really good growth.
Brian Tyler: Yeah. And I'd just say, we've created RxTS segment to give you visibility into how that business is performing, and we're quite pleased that both the core pharma and RxTS business. Our forward guide for FY 2023 is in line. And in the case of RxTS exceeding what we said in December, we thought was a long-run growth target. So we're very pleased with both those businesses and feel we're very well positioned.
Brian Tyler: Okay. Well, thank you. Thanks for your patience. I know we ran a few minutes longer than we normally do. It's typical at a year-end or year kick-off call. I want to thank everyone for your time and for joining this call. We really appreciate your thoughtful questions, and certainly, your interest in McKesson. Thank you, Cody, for facilitating the call for us. Just to conclude, McKesson delivered a strong fiscal 2022 with double-digit adjusted operating profit growth and I am excited about the continued progress of our company priorities into fiscal 2023. I'm confident about our ability to deliver strong growth, solid financial results and shareholder value creation. Of course, it's all due to the people that make up Team McKesson across all areas of our business. I want to thank them for their hard work and their dedication to executing on our strategies, for living our culture and our values and bringing positive changes to our partners, our customers and the patients that we impact. Thanks, again, everybody. I hope you all have a terrific evening.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-02-02 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to McKesson's Third Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Please be advised today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Rachel Rodriguez, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Rachel Rodriguez: Thank you, Keith. Good afternoon and welcome everyone to McKesson's third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. Today I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer, and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, such as forecasts about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings release and presentation slides available on our website at investor.mckesson.com and the risk factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Information about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this webcast, including reconciliation of these measures to GAAP results can be found in today's earnings release and presentation slides. The presentation slides also include a summary of our results for the quarter and updated guidance assumptions. With that, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Rachel and thank everyone for joining us on our call today. Today we reported third quarter fiscal 2022 results, another quarter with double-digit adjusted operating profit growth in all four segments, reflecting strength in the fundamentals across our businesses. Our focus and execution against our company priorities positions us consistently generate strong financial results despite fluidity we continue to see in the macro economic environment. Before I discuss the business performance, I would like to just quickly remind everyone of our company priorities we have been sharing with you our strategic transformation to a diversified healthcare services company centered around a set of four enterprise priorities. We believe that execution against these priorities is critical to our ability to generate long-term sustainable growth and we want to reiterate our focus and commitment to each one of them. Our first priority is our people, our teams and our culture. Through our diversified portfolio of assets and operations, we as a company touch and impact many aspects of health in the healthcare system, including patients embedded in our daily operations is our purpose, advancing health outcomes for all and our mission of building an impact driven organization. We've been focused on enabling change in three areas, improving access to healthcare, advancing health equity, and protecting our environment. In the past year, our employees came together and shared countless moments of impact, finding new ways to get involved and to contribute. In 2021 alone, we completed more than 26,500 volunteer hours and supported nearly 1,500 charities. I couldn't be more proud of what we've achieved so far. And I'm confident in our ability to build a brighter future that in fact, offers greater health outcomes for all. Part of our focus on culture is our continued improvement in diversity and inclusion. We put a particular focus on hiring, developing and promoting what we call a best talent strategy at McKesson. Recently, we were recognized as one of the best places to work for LGBTQ equality, the ninth year in a row we've received this honor. Our commitment to diversity and refreshment includes our board of directors. In January, we welcome James Hinton and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson as new independent directors to our board of directors. Both James and Kathleen have served in multiple senior leadership roles within the healthcare industry. Currently, Jim serves as an operating partner for the private equity firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe and prior to that, he held the role of Chief Executive Officer at Baylor Scott & White Health. And Kathleen, most recently held the role of Executive Vice President and Global Chief Human Resource Officer at Walgreens Boots Alliance, where she led the Human Capital Strategy including merger integration and HR transformation through digitization. Their decades of healthcare experience and proven record leading complicated organizations and executive leadership roles will be instrumental to McKesson, and we are excited to welcome them to our board. Additionally, we announced today that Don Knauss has been elected as the next Independent Chairman of our Board, which will go into effect on April 1, following a plan transition led by our current Independent Chair Edward Miller. I want to thank Ed for his years of steady leadership and invaluable contributions as the Independent Chair to McKesson's board of directors. And I also want to welcome Don to his new role. He brings deep leadership expertise and shares McKesson's values, culture, strategy, and vision including his commitment to board diversity, we look forward to his leadership and stewardship. Our next priority is to drive sustainable growth in our core pharmaceutical and medical distribution businesses. We have a vast scale distribution network and deep expertise in global supply chain management, which have been a critical and foundational part of our long history. We're proud of our operational excellence and our ability to capture efficiency and deliver consistent and high quality service to our customers while optimizing operating margin. Building off of this core capability, we've been very successful and expanding into new product categories and new adjacent markets like our lab solutions and our government partnership strategies. Our scaled assets and capabilities also enable us to play an integral role in the response to the COVID 19 pandemic. We're proud to serve as a centralized distributor of vaccines and ancillary supplies for the U.S. government. We've also been working closely with our partners, suppliers and manufacturers to navigate the complex supply chain system. These relationships have allowed us to continue to provide stability of supply and low costs for our customers. And as a result, we've been able to manage through some of the challenges that the market has been seeing. Our third priority is to streamline the business, which includes initiatives like the split-off of change healthcare and our strategic intent to fully exit the European region. We recently announced the sale of our Austrian business which was completed on January 31 and we have agreements to sell 10 of the 12 countries where we operate. As a reminder, Norway and Denmark remain the only countries that we have not entered into an agreement to sell. We continue to work towards the closing of the other pending divestitures. These transactions are the result of our intentional effort to evaluate and assess our portfolio for strategic alignment. We believe that by fully exiting the Europe region, we'll be able to better focus our human and financial capital into higher growth and higher margin areas, which leads me naturally to our next company priority. The last company priority is our strategic growth pillars, oncology and biopharma services. Over the past few years, we set out to accelerate the growth in these two areas, and build out what we refer to as ecosystems. As we shared in our Investor Day in December, these are both large and growing markets that have significant unmet needs and opportunities and we are tackling some of the most complex problems in the healthcare system with the goal to bring efficiency and benefits to all stakeholders across these ecosystems. In the oncology ecosystem, our growth strategy is centered around our support for the large growing and diversified U.S. oncology network. With the reach of over 1,400 physicians, the U.S. oncology network treats 15% of all new cancer patients in the U.S. at one of its 500 sites of service. One of the U.S. oncology networks important initiatives is its participation in the oncology care model, which is a five year experimental payment model with the goal of bringing down the cost of cancer. Based on the latest results, the U.S. oncology network practices participating in the program, achieved high marks on quality metrics and provided significant cost savings to Medicare. By representing approximately one-fourth of all providers participating in the program, the U.S. oncology network demonstrated its leadership role in transitioning healthcare to a more value based approach. Building upon our deep reach in the Community Oncology space, we're creating an oncology ecosystem with multifaceted service offerings that are all interconnected. At the center of this connectivity is Ontada, oncology, technology and insights business dedicated to help advanced cancer research and advanced patient care. We recently highlighted this business at our Investor Day. Since its launch in December of 2020, the team has made great progress transforming ideas into reality. Ontada signed two agreements with strategic partners to improve patient outcome and quality of patient care and it was instrumental in the launch of The MYLUNG consortium which through real world research and study provides critical information to improve the patient's journey. Within our biopharma ecosystem, we build a set of differentiated assets and capabilities, including businesses like RelayHealth Pharmacy, CoverMyMeds and RxCrossroads. They're combined under the prescription solutions business with a shared goal to improve access, adherence and affordability of medicines. One of the key customers of our business is biopharma companies, through our scale and interconnected technology network, we provide biopharma a range of commercialization services and by automating and simplifying the process of prior authorization, we reduce prescription abandonment and provide biopharma access to new patients. Our unique technology capabilities also generate insights into patients needs and challenges enabling greater ability to impact patient actions and get better outcomes. We support over 650 brands today covering 94% of the therapeutic areas and we're connected to all the major insurance companies and most of the regional payers in the United States. The reach of our network is deep and broad, which is why it's the foundation of our biopharma ecosystem and we are incredibly excited about the market opportunities it brings. Our progress with each of the company priorities has been truly outstanding and we see the strategies working. The strong conviction in these priorities will be our NorthStar as we seek to advance and win in the marketplaces as a diversified healthcare service company and to drive long-term sustainable growth for our shareholders. Now, before I turn to our third quarter results, I want to provide a brief update on the progress made towards a broad resolution of governmental opioid related claims. To date, 46 states, all five U.S. territories and Washington DC have joined the proposed settlement to sign on period for political subdivisions in participating states to join the previously announced Proposed Opioid Settlement Agreement founded on January 26. We have now entered into the evaluation period. The deadline for our decision is February 25 2022. We continue to work with all parties to bring meaningful relief to effective communities and towards resolutions which will allow us to further focus on the strategic priorities of our business. Now, let me get to the results. We're pleased to report a strong third quarter with total company revenues of $68.6 billion and an adjusted earnings per diluted share of $6.15 ahead of our expectations. As a result of our performance in the underlying business and the contribution from COVID-19 related items, we're raising our adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance to $23.55 to $23.95. This is from the previous range of $22.35 to $22.95. The third quarter was another example of the nonlinear nature of the recovery from the pandemic. At the beginning of the quarter, volume and utilization trends were recovering as COVID 19 cases continue to decline across the country. Although we expected a nonlinear recovery trend, emergence in the spread of the Omicron variant in December was unexpected. Since then, we've been closely monitoring its impact. One thing we've learned in the past two years is the resilience of our business and our communities. Regardless of the trajectory of the pandemic, we're confident about our ability to adjust and adapt to support our customers and their patients in these challenging times. Let's turn to the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. U.S. Pharmaceutical segment saw 12% adjusted operating profit growth, which was underpinned by the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution and increased specialty volume. Through the third quarter and into January, branded pharmaceutical pricing is tracked in line with our original expectations, and consistent with our experience over the past several years. For generics we continue to benefit from the success and strength of our sourcing operation with ClarusONE. We have not only the scale, but the procurement expertise to consistently source products at low cost while protecting the integrity and the safety of the supply chain. We are also proud of our role in supporting the U.S. government's pandemic response effort as the vaccine and booster recommendations for various age groups continues to expand and evolve. Through January 31, our U.S. pharmaceutical business has successfully distributed over 370 million Moderna and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines to International Donation Mission. In January, U.S. government extended the existing COVID-19 vaccine and distribution contract through July of 2022 which is roughly in line with the first quarter of our fiscal 2023. In prescription technology solutions, the segment had excellent momentum and delivered an 11% increase to segment adjusted operating profit in the third quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we offer a range of commercial services primarily to biopharma companies. And this quarter the growth was led by third-party logistics services and our access adherence and affordability solutions, including our access for more patients product. This segment aligns with our focus on developing the biopharma services ecosystem. The market that we're focused on presents many exciting opportunities, and we estimate the total addressable market to be around $15 billion with good growth potential and an attractive margin profile. We are pleased with the financial performance and expect to continue to drive, while growing the business. With surging demand and a complex supply chain our new products playing an important role in the fight against the pandemic. The dedicated team and med surge is the foundation to our business growth, and we continue to invest to ensure operational continuity and excellence. As it relates to our international segment, we continue to benefit from COVID-19 related programs and our European operations in Canada. Through December, we've distributed over 81 million vaccines to administration sites in select markets across our international geographies. As we look forward to fiscal 2023, I'm most excited about the progress on the four company priorities. Since the rollout of these multi-year strategic initiatives in our fiscal 2019, we've been very focused on execution, making impact and delivering results. While the pandemic continues to present unknowns, what is certain is that fiscal 2023 will be another year in which we focus on strong execution on strategic advancement. Our continued progress towards these four priorities will be a key driver to our sustainable profit growth, strong cash flow, and shareholder value creation. We continue to focus on the things that matter most to our customers, to our patients, to our employees, and to our shareholders. In closing, we continue to be excited about our future growth prospects as we meet the opportunity as a diversified healthcare services company. We have unique and differentiated assets in oncology and biopharma services with unmatched scale and connectivity. And we're strategically positioned to win in these growing markets. And lastly, before I conclude, I want to take a moment to thank our dedicated team, including every one of a 76,000 employees that make up team McKesson. We share a mission to improve healthcare in every setting. And that will be achieved only with the dedication and the commitment from our people. And for the opportunity to work alongside this amazing team. I continue to be humbled and deeply grateful. Thank you for your time this afternoon. Britt, I'll pass it to you.
Britt Vitalone: Thank you, Brian. And good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to discuss our fiscal third quarter results, which reflects another quarter of strong performance across the business driven by operational execution against our growth strategies. In the third quarter, we delivered overall growth compared to the prior year results across each of our segments including growth over the prior year on excluding COVID-19 related programs. Let me start with an update on Europe. We remain committed to fully exit the European region and the progress of our exit activities are on track. Today we announced the transactions to sell our Austrian business to Quadrifolia Management and the sale of McKesson remaining share of our German joint ventures to Walgreens Boots Alliance closed on January 31 of '22. The assets involved in the Austrian transaction contributed approximately $1.5 billion in revenues and $50 million in adjusted operating profit in fiscal 2021. The earnings related to our German joint venture were immaterial. Next pursued to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. We anticipate the pending divestiture to sell McKesson's U.K. retail and distribution businesses will close in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. And the transaction to sell certain European assets to the PHOENIX Group will close in the first half of fiscal 2023. The net assets included in these transactions are classified as held for sale. Our fiscal 2022 guidance includes approximately $0.49 of adjusted earnings per diluted share accretion related to these pending transactions, which is recorded within our international segment. This $0.49 of accretion resulting from the held for sale accounting will conclude once each transaction is closed. For fiscal 2023, we currently anticipate approximately $0.10 of adjusted earnings per diluted share of accretion related to the held for sale accounting based on the current estimated close date for the PHOENIX Group transaction. Norway and Denmark remain the only countries that we have not entered into an agreement to sell. As previously discussed, we anticipate we'll deploy capital to offset dilution resulting from all European divestitures principally through share repurchases. Before I provide more details on our third quarter adjusted results, I want to point out one additional item that impacted our GAAP only results in the quarter. We recorded a gap only after-tax charge of $829 million related to the sale of retail and distribution businesses in the U.K. to account for the remeasurement of the net assets to the lower carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell. These charges were largely driven by declines in the British pound sterling. Moving now to our adjusted results for the third quarter. Beginning with our consolidated results which can be found on Slide 7. As discussed in our Investor Day event in December, we manage the business for the long-term and our financial and strategic framework is focused on shareholder value creation. Our financial framework combined three key elements to generate sustainable adjusted EPS growth, organic growth, operating leverage and capital allocation. This framework is once again demonstrated by our strong third quarter fiscal 2022 results. Additionally, our leadership supporting the U.S. governments COVID-19 domestic and international vaccine and kitting efforts continues to contribute to growth and the momentum we have built across the business. Third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $6.15, an increase of 34% compared to the prior year. This result was driven by strong operational performance across the segments. COVID-19 related items, which include the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution, kitting and storage programs of the U.S. government. COVID-19 tests in fiscal 2021 impairments of personal protective equipment and related products, and a lower share count. Consolidated revenues of $68.6 billion increased 10% above the prior year, primarily driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment largely due to higher volumes from our retail national account customers. And branded pharmaceutical price increases, which were in line with our initial guidance, partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Adjusted gross profit was $3.4 billion for the quarter and increase of 8% compared to the prior year, which benefited from the increased contribution from our strong operational performance and previously mentioned COVID-19 programs and related items. Adjusted operating expenses in the quarter increased 1% year-over-year, excluding the impact of held for sale accounting and announced divestitures in the international segment adjusted operating expenses increased 2% year-over-year. Adjusted operating profit was $1.3 billion for the quarter an increase of 19% compared to the prior year led by strong operational performance across the segments. Moving below the line, interest expense was $41 million in the quarter and improvement of 25% compared to the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate was 19.6% for the quarter. And wrapping up our consolidated results, third quarter diluted weighted average shares were $153.5 million, a decrease of 5% year-over-year. Moving now to our third quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 8 through 13. Starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Revenues were $55 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year, driven by higher volumes from our retail national account customers and branded pharmaceutical price increases partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Adjusted operating profit increased 12% to $735 million driven by the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution and growth in the distribution of specialty products to hospitals and community conditions. The contribution from our contract with the U.S. government, with the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines provided a benefit of approximately $0.26 per share in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. In the prescription technology solution segment, revenues were $1 billion an increase of 33% higher volume growth related to biopharma services, including third-party logistics services and increased technology service revenue, partially resulting from the growth of prescription volumes. Adjusted operating profit increased a 11% to a $145 million driven by growth from access inherent solutions. We continue to experience growth across our broad spectrum, higher margin capabilities and offerings in this segment. We're pleased with the increased transaction volumes related to our access inherent solutions, and the increasing number of brands that joined our platforms this year. We also experienced increased volumes in our logistics and hub services, due to the continued recovery of prescription volumes. Moving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $3.1 billion, an increase of 1% driven by growth in the primary care business, and the contribution from kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines, partially offset by lower revenue from COVID-19 tests in our primary care and extended care businesses as compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating profit increased 18% to $330 million driven by the contribution from kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. governments COVID-19 vaccine program, the prior year impact of an inventory of impairment charge related to PPE that incurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and growth in the primary care business. The contribution from our contract with U.S. government related to the kitting, distribution and storage of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines provided a benefit of approximately $0.31 per share in the quarter, which was above our original expectations. Next, let me address our international results. Revenues in the quarter were $9.5 billion, an increase of 2% driven by new customer growth in our Canadian business, and volume increases in the pharmaceutical distribution and retail businesses across the segment, which were partially offset by the contribution of McKesson's German wholesale business through joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. On an FX adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit increased 41% to $223 million, driven by the reduction as compared to the prior year of depreciation and amortization. Uncertain European assets classified as held for sale, the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and tests in Europe and strong distribution results in our Canadian business. The held for sale accounting in the international segment contributed $0.18 to adjusted earnings in the quarter. Moving on to corporate, adjusted corporate expenses were $159 million, an increase of 1% year-over-year. We incurred opioid related litigation expenses of $33 million for the third quarter. We anticipate that fiscal 2022 opioid related litigation expenses will be approximately $135 million. Let me now turn to our cash position, which can be found on Slide 14. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.8 billion. For the first nine months of the fiscal year we generated free cash flow of $1.2 billion. Here to-date it made $380 million of capital expenditures, which included investments to support our strategic pillars of oncology and biopharma services. For the first nine months of the fiscal year, we returned $2.2 billion of cash to our shareholders, which included $2 billion of share repurchases and the payment of $206 million in dividends. At our Investor Day event in December, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an increase of $4 billion to our existing share repurchase program. At the end of our third quarter $4.8 billion remains on our share repurchase authorization. With this increased authorization, the completed sales of the Austrian business and remaining share in the German joint venture and the anticipated fiscal fourth quarter closure the sale of the U.K. business, we anticipate executing share repurchases of up to $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter. As a result, we now anticipate returning approximately $3.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases in fiscal 2022. Our strong operating performance combined with our return of capital to shareholders, reinforces our commitment to driving the shareholder value. Let me transition and speak to our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2022. A full list of our fiscal 2022 assumptions can be found in Slide 16 through 18. We continue to anticipate a full recovery of prescription volumes. However, the persistence of COVID-19 and its variants such as Omicron, is leading to a non-linear trajectory. In the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, we anticipate revenue to increase 8% to 11% and adjusted operating profit to deliver 8% to 10% growth over the prior year. We continue to see stable fundamentals in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. Specifically, our outlook for branded pharmaceutical pricing of mid single digits increases in fiscal 2022 remains consistent with both our original guidance and prior-year. In our view of the generics environment remains competitive yet stable. Our guidance remains aligned to the volume distribution schedule provided by the CDC and U.S. government, and includes the contribution related to our role as a centralized distributor for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution program. We will continue to update you in the progress and contribution from this program. When excluding COVID-19 vaccine distribution in the segment, we anticipate approximately 3% to 6% adjusted operating profit growth. And as a reminder, our investments in our leading and differentiated position in oncology will continue to represent an approximate $0.20 headwind in fiscal 2022. In our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we anticipate revenue growth of 32% to 36%, and adjusted operating profit growth of 24% to 28%. This growth reflects the strong momentum in the business, as we project increased volumes across new and existing biopharma solutions and customers. Transitioning to medical surgical, our outlook assumes 15% to 19% revenue growth, and adjusted operating profit growth of 51% to 55% over the prior-year. Our outlook includes $0.85 to $1.05 related to the contribution from the U.S. government's distribution of ancillary supply kits, and storage programs and $0.75 to $0.95 related to the net impact of COVID-19 tests, and PPE impairments and related products. When excluding the impacts of these items in the segment, we anticipate 22% to 26% growth over the prior-year. One additional reminder related to our U.S. distribution businesses. On our earnings call in November, we discussed the highly competitive labor market, which continues to persist. We also outlined an assumption for modest labor related expense impact to ensure support of our talent strategy and continued service continuity through the second half of our fiscal year. Based on labor market trends experienced in the third quarter and our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year, we continue to anticipate approximately $0.10 to $0.20 of adjusted operating expense impact in our U.S. distribution businesses in the second half of the year, weighted slightly higher in our Medical segment. Finally, in the International segment, our revenue guidance 2% decline to 1% growth as compared to the prior-year. And as a reminder, this reflects the impact from the contribution of our German wholesale business to a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. For adjusted operating profit, our guidance reflects growth in the segment of 43% to 47%. This includes approximately $0.49 of adjusted earnings accretion in fiscal 2022 resulting from held for sale accounting related to our agreement to sell certain European assets. Turning now to the consolidated view. Our increased guidance assumes 8% to 11% revenue growth and 24% to 27% adjusted operating profit growth compared to fiscal 2021. Our full-year adjustment effective tax rate guidance of 18% to 19% remains unchanged and we anticipate corporate expenses in the range of $570 million to $620 million an improvement from the previous range of $610 million to $660 million related to our focus on operating leverage, which we highlighted at our recent Investor Day event. Let me now turn to cash flow and capital deployment. We expect our businesses to continue to drive strong free cash flows and returns on capital even as we continue reinvesting to support sustainable long-term growth. This strong free cash flow generation provides financial flexibility to execute a balanced capital allocation approach including investing in our strategic growth pillars of oncology and biopharma services, while remaining committed to returning capital to shareholders through our growing dividends and share repurchases. Our investment grade credit rating remains a priority and it underpins our financial flexibility. For fiscal 2022, we continue to anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.5 billion to $3.9 billion, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses. As a reminder, historically, we generate a larger portion of our cash flows in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Our working capital metrics and resulting cash flows vary from quarter-to-quarter, impacted by timing, which could include the timing of planned European divestiture activity. We also now anticipate diluted weighted shares outstanding to range from 154 million to 155 million for fiscal 2022. This includes the impact of the anticipated 1.5 billion of fourth quarter share repurchases mentioned earlier. As a result of our strong year-to-date performance and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are raising and narrowing our previous adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $23.55 to $23.95, which is above our previous range of $22.35 to $22.95. Our updated outlook for adjusted earnings per diluted share reflects 37% to 39% growth compared to the prior-year. Fiscal 2022 adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance also includes $2.99 to $3.59 of contribution attributable to the following items, $0.90 to $1.10, related to the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution, $0.85 to $1.05 related to the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies, $0.75 to $0.95 related to COVID-19 tests in the fiscal 2021 impairments for PPE and related products, which is an increase from the previous range of $0.50 to $0.75, and approximately $0.49 from gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures Equity Investments which are within our corporate segment. Excluding the impacts of these items from both fiscal 2022 guidance and fiscal 2021 results, this indicates 27% to 33% forecast growth over the prior-year. When you pull it all together, our strong performance in our outlook equates to an adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance increase of $1.10 compared to our previous fiscal 2022 outlook provided at Investor Day, the $1.10 adjusted earnings per diluted share increase includes the following. Approximately $0.45 driven by strong underlying business performance and operating leverage, approximately $0.22 related to COVID-19 tests, approximately $0.22 related to held for sale accounting and reduced opioid litigation expenses, and approximately $0.20 related to NCI interest expense and lower weighted average shares outstanding. Let me spend just a minute providing some initial thoughts on fiscal 2023. I want to point out that we are not providing fiscal 2023 guidance at this time. However, I thought it would be instructive to walk you through some of the items that could impact fiscal 2023 as we sit here today. First, the COVID 19 pandemic continues to present many unknowns, we continue to expect to full recovery. However, it is likely to continue to be non-linear into fiscal 2023 and it could impact a quarterly cadence. In the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical Surgical Solution segments, our contracts with the U.S. government to serve as the centralized distributor of COVID-19 vaccines and to assist with the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies are scheduled to expire in July of 2022. Outside of the contract with U.S. government for COVID-19 vaccine distribution, we anticipate normal customer renewal activity in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. As it relates to COVID-19 tests, we continue to anticipate the demand will be closely associated with a rate of COVID case levels and the impact from this will moderate from prior-year levels. For the International segment, we anticipate $0.10 of adjusted earnings per diluted share accretion in the first half of fiscal 2023 related to the held for sale accounting based on the current estimated closed date for the Phoenix Group transaction. We will no longer record revenue adjusted operating profit or held for sale accounting benefits related to these transactions once the transactions close. We anticipate that opioid litigation expenses will remain relatively in line with our fiscal 2022 guidance, until we have a completed assessment of government entity participation in the proposed settlement and a final determination regarding that settlement. We will continue to update you on the outcome of that determination and remaining opioid litigation expenses. We anticipate further investment to support the growth of our two key strategies of oncology and biopharma services. Overall, we continue to see strength and stability in the underlying fundamentals of the business heading into fiscal 2023 and we remain optimistic about future growth opportunities. We'll share more details with you about our fiscal 2023 outlook at our fourth quarter earnings call in May. In closing, we are pleased with the results of our fiscal third quarter and we have a strong financial outlook. McKesson continues to deliver strong results as we successfully execute against our strategic and financial framework. We continue to focus on the things that matter most to our customers, patients and shareholders as a diversified healthcare services company. I want to thank you and thank all of our employees for all their hard work and dedication. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Eric Percher with Nephron Research.
Eric Percher: Thank you and appreciate the commentary on fiscal year '23. At this point, one thing I want to zero in on relative to the EU. So you'll remove most of the factors $0.10 of benefit continuing to flow through. As you speak to offsetting with repurchase, is that part of what the repo that you suggested for Q4 is getting in front of and do you expect your - how will you judge that? Will you judge it over the full fiscal year given that the timing is still variable?
Brian Tyler: Thanks, Eric for that question. As I talked about in my remarks, we do anticipate that the Austrian transaction, the German transaction, which have already closed, we anticipate that the U.K. transaction will also close in the fourth quarter. So consistent with our comments, we do intend to offset the dilution. And that is one of the reasons why we intended to do some fourth quarter share repurchases, we will continue to apply the principles of our share repurchase activity and certainly we'll look at cash that is in excess of what we need to operate the business as well as other opportunities that we have to deploy that capital, whether that be additional share repurchases for our shareholders, or if we have M&A transactions. So certainly we told you, we would offset the dilution. We're closing transactions now and anticipate more in the fourth quarter. And so that was one of the reasons why we wanted to begin the share repurchase activity, in addition to being very consistent with our share repurchase principles.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please.
Operator: And our next will be from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa Gill: Thanks very much. Good afternoon, and thanks for all the detail. Britt, I just want to go back and talk about inflation. You talked a little bit about labor. And I know you and Brian talked last quarter about some special bonuses and increasing wages. But how do we think about wages going forward as we continue to have wage inflation would be my first part of the inflation question. And then secondly, as we think about product inflation, or transportation, I know generally speaking, it's a passthrough on the pharmaceutical side of things. But how do we think about any PPE on your medical side of your business?
Britt Vitalone: Lisa, thanks for that question. Maybe I'll just step back for a minute and just address labor and inflation separately, and maybe I'll just start with inflation. Our business model has a normal component that's built into it that relates to pricing, you have a model like we do that's founded on both supply and service stability and consistency, that solves problems, but in a better way for customers and patients, we are able to incorporate some of these higher input costs, through pricing. Our organization, as Brian has talked about continues to do really a tremendous job in productivity efforts. And those productivity efforts enable us to offset some of this cost. And then of course, there is a pricing component. Just finally, we have an organization of really smart people that are continuously working to find better solutions, greater efficiencies, in leveraging the scale and broad expertise that we have to provide quality and reliability that our customers have come to expect from McKesson. So that's maybe just answering some of the questions on the inflation front. In the labor front, Brian's talked about talent being one of our key components of our strategy, and will remain that and of course, this is a very challenging market. We're seeing pressures in the labor market. And so we've talked about the fact that we expect some of these labor pressures to find their way into operating expenses in the second half of the year $0.10 to $0.20. We've not guided beyond FY '22, we'll obviously assess if we think that those costs are going to be sustained in any way at this point, we just see a $0.10 to $0.20 impact in our U.S. distribution businesses in the second half, what we've seen so far in the third quarter, it's tracking right in line with that.
Brian Tyler: We will stay on top of the market, we'll be responsive to it, we got a lot of confidence in our team's ability to adjust. And we actually think we've got an asset in terms of the company culture, our purpose, our mission, the investments we make in our teams, we think this is a great place to work and we'll continue to find ways to attract the best talent.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please.
Operator: And next will be Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Charles Rhyee: Yes, hey, thanks for taking the question. Britt, you talked earlier in your prepared comments about in the Pharma Technology Solutions segment about access to medications. And you highlight a couple of businesses, you mentioned a $15 billion market opportunity here. Maybe if you can just give us a little more details around sort of your position in the market, in this part of the market particularly and what is the competitive landscape? And do you see an opportunity here for McKesson to consolidate in this industry?
Brian Tyler: Thank you for the question. I think you addressed it to Britt, but I'll jump in and start with my thoughts. I mean, so this we think we're extremely well positioned in this marketplace. And one of the things when we're anchoring our growth strategies, we try to anchor around is making sure we have differentiation that we have things that are difficult to replicate. And the reason we brought these businesses together as a segment is because we think individually, they all had their strengths and we're winning in their market, but collectively together accessing the reach of our networks, utilizing the advanced technologies, we have in CoverMyMeds and then the clinical expertise and the biopharma relationships, we had in RxCrossroads, they kind of reinforce and compound each other. And so we think about the access as distinct market, adherence is a distinct market, outcomes is a distinct market, but by putting these together, it allows us to really more effectively compete across all of those some of that is reinventing a better solution for a market that exists. That's sort of what we did with AMP, we brought in infusion of technology to really redesign and greatly enhance the value we deliver to manufacturers, giving us what we think is a significant competitive advantage. We'll continue to do those kinds of innovations as we grow into it. I mean, it is a pretty fragmented landscape. There are some competitors names you know, there's frankly lots of little ones. This is an area that we would like to use the strength of our balance sheet to be acquisitive, to be additive to that ecosystem through additional capability or additional scale. As long as we find that strategically aligned asset and it can meet our financial hurdles and stand up well to other means, we have to deploy capital, we'll certainly look to execute on that.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please.
Operator: And the next one will be from Jailendra Singh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Jailendra Singh: Thank you, and hello, everyone. So we just go to $0.45 core business outperformance, you called out which is now captured in your fiscal '22 outlook. How do you think about the sustainability of some of those drivers behind that outperformance and related to that how should we think about the fiscal '22 baseline EPS of $17.50 to $18 you share that is today?
Brian Tyler: Let me take those in two pieces. We're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance and obviously saw growth across each of our segments. So as we look at the outlook for the remainder of the year, we expected the momentum in our business is going to continue. And we haven't provided any guidance as it relates to FY '23 but in our Investor Day, we did provide long-term targets where we suggested and felt very confident that we'll continue to see growth in each of those segments for the long-term. So we feel very good about the performance that we're seeing in our business and consistent with our Investor Day, we expect that to continue. So I think that is really the point that you should see just continued strong performance for several years now across all of our segments with the fundamentals of our businesses are strong, we're investing in these businesses for future growth. And we're in markets that we think are going to continue to grow and we're in very good positions to take advantage of that with some differentiated capabilities.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please.
Operator: And next will be Michael Cherny with Bank of America.
Michael Cherny: Good afternoon, and thanks for the color so far. I want to talk a little bit about the U.S. pharma segment. As you think about into next year and thinking more qualitatively as much as anything else. But how do you think about outside of the COVID related script and volume recovery, the other moving pieces. You did comment on a normalized renewal year? So are there any things you're seeing there big renewals, and how you think about the areas of growth that have remain steady, maybe within specialty and the potential for biosimilars? And how that should factor into that long-term growth trajectory and where that falls relative to '23 broadly?
Britt Vitalone: Mike, thanks for the question. Maybe I'll start, and then I'll let Brian jump in here. Again, I - as we think about it, and some of the things that I mentioned here. We do expect a full recovery of prescription transaction volumes. And we're certainly pleased that transaction volumes have continued to increase throughout the year, it has not been in a straight line. But we do expect that full recovery to continue. We're very well positioned in the specialty clinic space, as well as on oncology, making investments in those areas that we think are going to continue to pay off over the long-term. And biosimilars is one of those areas that given our position, particularly in oncology. We believe that it's going to be a growth driver for us over the long-term. We're pleased with the development of biosimilars to this point, we think that they offer a better returns than branded and specialty products, not at the same level as generics from a margin perspective. But still, were we believe and were optimistic that they're going to continue to add value to the segment over time. So the position that we have, the strength that we have across segments, but particularly our differentiated capabilities in oncology. Your positions is very well for further growth.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please.
Operator: And next will be Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Congrats to the quarter. I guess Britt my question is the medical segment, operating income rates was pretty significant. Even if you backed out, COVID? Can you just dissect for us that outperformance and how should we be thinking about the sustainability of earnings in that segment past 2022?
Britt Vitalone: Thanks for the question, Brian. Maybe I'll just start just to remind you, since fiscal '19, this business has grown at 10% from an adjusted operating profit perspective. On the core basis outside of COVID programs. So we've seen strong growth in this business now for a number of years. It's one of our higher margin segments. We have very strong positions across the primary care segment of the business. And across all alternate sites, your extended care business has grown nicely over time as well. We've added a lot of capabilities and investment over time, whether that be acquisitions to position us well in lab. We've seen private brand be an important component. And we've seen growth in Rx as well. So we've got a lot of capabilities across the entire alternate site. We've invested in these capabilities over time. It's positioned us well, not only from a core perspective, but certainly now as COVID has taken on. We've been in really good position to handle the kitting and the storage programs as well.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please.
Operator: And next will be Rick, excuse me, Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser: Yes. Hi, good evening, and thanks for the very comprehensive details. So two follow-ups here. One, just to clarify, as you think about 2023, should we assume that all the buyback activity is going to be offsetting the dilution from the European divestitures that's first? And then secondly, as we think about the COVID impact, when we clearly did nice contribution in the last couple of years. How do you think the economics of vaccine in testing will evolve is sort of COVID becomes more of an annuity is. Should we think about it as is flu type economics?
Britt Vitalone: Ricky, let me take the first one. And then I'll let Brian come on the second. Just because more mechanical question. As I mentioned in my comments, we do expect to offset any dilution from the European divestitures through capital deployment. And that could be share repurchase activity like we're doing in the fourth quarter. So just to reaffirm that we will be - we do plan on offsetting that dilution.
Brian Tyler: Ricky relative to I guess it's called the future of testing. That's a little bit, I think difficult to forecast. And a lot of it will depend on the science, the development, a lot of it will depend on the current testing hold up to current and future potential variants. What will be the mix between, in a medical setting versus over the counter that those become more reliable. I think there's a lot of questions that still have to resolve themselves there. What I would say though is, regardless of how that evolves, we think McKesson is in an excellent position to capitalize on that. We are currently the largest distributor, we distribute more flu vaccine than anyone. We have a great franchise in the physician alternate site setting. We distribute to pharmacies, because of our presence in the communities in both our medical and pharmaceutical business, our relationships with the labs, and I think the real credibility we've built up over the last couple of years, I think we're extremely well positioned to capture that opportunity, however it unfolds.
Rachel Rodriguez: We have time for one more question.
Operator: Most certainly. And this question will come from Steve Valiquette with Barclays.
Steven Valiquette: Thanks. Good afternoon. I also have a question just around the - your comment around the normal customer renewal activity in fiscal '23. I guess I just wanted to make sure and confirm the messaging around that. So I guess first, can you remind us how customer renewal activity and any related pricing step downs trended for fiscal '22. In those, if that activity is going to be normal in '23. Is that net positive, net negative or net neutral. As you think about the how all that flows year-over-year? Hopefully that question makes sense. Thanks.
Britt Vitalone: Yes. Thanks, Steve, that's a good question. I'm happy to answer that. And I'm happy to clarify. When I speak of normal, what I mean by that is in any year, we typically see about a third of our U.S. pharmaceutical book renewal. As we have seen over the last few years, there has been no material impacts to that. And certainly, we've been able to renew all of our customers successfully within our guidance. And I would not anticipate that we would see anything material from our - next year. It's early, obviously, if there's an update to that information will provide it on our May earnings call. But normal, what I was referring to is that about a third of our book renews every year would not anticipate anything that would be a material driver from that activity.
Brian Tyler: Great. Well, thanks again, everyone for joining us on this call. And thank you for the insightful and very thoughtful questions. Keith, thank you for help facilitating the call. I wanted to just conclude by reiterating McKesson executed really well in the third quarter with double-digit adjusted operating profit growth in all segments. I continue to be excited about the focus on our company priorities and the contributions we can see that making the strong financial results. It's really the driver between - the driver of our shareholder value creation. So none of that happens without the team that makes up McKesson. And so, to everyone, in McKesson, no matter what your role, no matter what geography you work in, whether you're on the frontline or elsewhere in the business. I'm so appreciate of their hard work, their dedication to our purpose and our mission. Their commitment to our customers. They really are what makes this a special place. So thanks to them. Again thank you everyone, I hope you have a terrific evening. Be safe and stay healthy.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

===== 2022 Q2  (2021-11-01 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Please stand by. Welcome to McKesson's Q2 Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Rachel Rodriguez. Please go ahead.
Rachel Rodriguez: Thank you, Sarah (ph.). Good afternoon and welcome everyone to McKesson's Second Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Taylor, our Chief Executive Officer, and Britt Vital one, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements such as forecasts about McKesson's operations and future results.  Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's press release and our slide presentation, and to the risk factor section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Additional information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results is included in today's press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website at investor.McKesson.com. With that, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Rachel, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our second quarter call today. We are happy to report another strong quarter for McKesson, driven by continued market improvements and the underlying fundamentals of our businesses. We achieved double-digit adjusted operating profit growth in all four segments based on a strong operating performance and alignment across the enterprise.  As a result of our second quarter performance, our confidence in the second half of the fiscal year, and McKesson's continued role in the COVID-19 response efforts, we are raising our guidance range for fiscal 2022 to adjusted earnings per diluted share from $19.80 to $20.40 to a new range of $21.95 to $22.55.  We continue to believe we will see a return to pre - COVID pharmaceutical prescription and patient engagement levels in the second half of our current fiscal year. We are encouraged by the trends we continue to see across primary care specialty and oncology patient visits, in addition to overall prescription volumes. We're pleased to see our markets are recovering in line with our original expectations. Our enterprise-wide focus on our Company priorities is driving operating performance, and furthering the advancement of our long-term growth. I would like to take the time today to talk about each of our Company's priorities. First, we have a focus on our people and the culture, which is guided by our ICARE and ILEAD values.  These values include a commitment to both our local and global communities, our customers, and the healthcare industry to innovate and deliver opportunities that make our customers more successful, all for the better health of patients. Along with these values, we're committed to fostering an inclusive workplace that celebrates our differences and respects the diverse world in which we live and work. As an organization, we continue to be committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion through a more diverse and inclusive workplace we are a stronger, more creative, and a more productive team.  At McKesson, our priority has been the health and safety of our employees, and we're deeply committed to supporting our team members across the organization, which is why I'm incredibly pleased to have announced McKesson's first-ever day of wellness, which we call "Your day, your way. " This will take place this Friday, November 5th. We understand that mental, physical, and emotional well-being or most importance to our team.  So, we've made the decision to set aside a special day to help ensure our employees can rest, recharge, and take time for themselves. We're so grateful for all the contributions from the team over the last 19 months. McKesson employees continue to be in the center of the fight against COVID-19 and we want to make sure everyone gets a chance to take a well-deserved break. Our second priority is to strengthen our core pharmaceutical and medical supply chain businesses across North America, we have a best-in-class pharmaceutical supply chain.  As a reminder, in the U.S. we have a scale distribution presence that delivers roughly 1/3 of prescription medicines each day. Our operational excellence and our ability to leverage our scale of global suppliers is one of the many reasons why McKesson continues to be the partner of choice for hospitals, health systems, and pharmacies of all size.  We strengthened our business when we strengthen our customers and partners. This past quarter, we held our annual McKesson idea Share educational event, which brought together independent pharmacy operators to help them learn new skills, how to grow strategically, and how to operate efficiently. The virtual experience helps 2,000 independent pharmacies prioritize education and networking, which we believe will shape the future of community pharmacy and strengthen the independent business for the better.  In Canada, we've been the leader in healthcare related logistics and distribution for 100 years, and we support hospitals, community, and retail pharmacies to ensure that medication is always available. We're a leader in medical distribution to alternate site markets, and our footprint in the U.S. healthcare is underpinned by our strong sourcing and supply chain capabilities. We deliver medical and surgical supplies and services to over 250,000 customers. Our pharmaceutical and medical distribution businesses continue to play an integral role in the pandemic response efforts. And our capabilities have been highlighted through our evolving partnership with the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution, kitting, and storage programs.  I'm glad to say that the fundamentals in our core business remain solid and our execution has continued to improve as we accelerate our growth and work to deliver high-quality, resilient supply chains to our customers. Our third Company priority is to simplify and streamline the business. We're prioritizing the areas where we have deep expertise and are central to our long-term growth strategies, largely within the North American market.  As a result, we made the decision to fully exit McKesson's businesses in the European region. In July, we announced that we have entered into an agreement to sell our European businesses in France, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Belgium, and Slovenia to the Phoenix Group. Today, we're announcing that McKesson has made the decision to sell our UK retail and distribution businesses as a whole.  The transaction is expected to close in Q4 of Fiscal 2022, subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. We believe this step toward a full exit of our European business is an important milestone in our strategy as a streamlined, efficient, focused organization. Building upon the foundation of a strong Company culture, and a stable business, the last Company priority encompasses our 2 strategic growth pillars. We are investing to advance our Oncology and Biopharma services, which includes building integrated ecosystem that leverage our differentiated assets and capabilities, and our strategic focus on these 2 pillars is important as both of these areas have good inherent growth opportunities. McKesson's oncology ecosystem supports over 14,000 specialty physicians through distribution and GPO services. And we are the leading distributor in the community oncology space. We have over 1,400 physicians in the U.S.  Oncology Network spread over approximately 600 sites of care in the U.S. Within our oncology ecosystem, Ontada generates insights at the intersection of technology and data, and supports community providers with precise cancer care by improving patient outcomes and delivering evidence and insights to help accelerate life sciences research. Ecosystem helps the clinicians to provide better care in an increasingly complicated oncology care landscape by helping them grow their businesses, attract more patients, and produce better health outcomes.  We can then leverage interconnected technology and real-world insights to speed data backup stream to manufacturers, which can help them think about identifying new products, innovations, and new markets. Within the biopharma ecosystem that prescription Technology Solutions businesses leverage technology networks and access to provide our workflows to serve biopharma and Life Sciences partners and patients.  We have built this ecosystem over many years as it includes assets like Relay Health Pharmacy, CoverMyMeds, and RxCrossroads. It allows us to connect providers, payers, and patients together to focus on access, adherence, and affordability solutions. Our two strategic pillars of oncology and biopharma services are not just businesses or products, but fundamentally a suite of solutions that solve long-standing problems in ways that bring more speed, impact, and efficiency.  We will continue to invest and accelerate the execution against those strategies, which support the long-term growth for McKesson. I'm confident in the progress against our Company's priorities, that they will enable the advancement of our growth. Before I turn to our second quarter results, just a brief update on our Board of Directors.  In September, our Board of Directors welcomed Dr. Richard Carmona as a new independent director. Dr. Carmona has a strong focus on improving public health care and extensive experience in clinical sciences, healthcare management, and emergency preparedness, which led to his nomination and unanimous Senate confirmation as the 17th Surgeon General of the U.S from 2002 until 2006. Currently, Dr. Carmona is Chief of Health Innovations at Canyon Ranch and a Professor of Public Health at the University of Arizona. His hands-on healthcare experience will be invaluable for McKesson's Board of Directors.  Now, I want to turn to the business performance within the second quarter. We are pleased with our strong second quarter performance and we remain encouraged by the underlying fundamentals in our business. Let me start with U.S. pharmaceutical, where our solid results for the second quarter reflected continued improvement of prescription trends, which were in line with our expectations. Within specialty oncology visits, we saw an exit rate of pre -COVID levels, which again was in line with our expectations.  The U.S. pharmaceutical segment saw 12% adjusted operating profit growth, which was underpinned by the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems, and the contribution from our successful COVID-19 vaccine distribution operations. We're in a strong position to continue to support the government and private enterprise in the future for distributing COVID and flu vaccines. And our investments in the distribution business continue to be showcased through our successful vaccine response.  Through October 28th, our U.S. pharmaceutical business has successfully distributed over 311 million Moderna and J&J COVID-19 vaccines to administration sites across the U.S and to support the U.S. government's international donation mission. In Prescription Technology Solutions, the business continued to perform well this quarter as our technology and service offerings have accelerated the support and growth of our biopharma customers and we've been successful in adding new brands to our platforms. The segment had excellent momentum and delivered a 38% increase to adjusted operating profit growth during the second quarter.  In addition to the operational strength, I'm proud to say that we are helping patients get access to the therapies through our market-leading technology offerings in this segment. In medical-surgical, we saw an increase in COVID-19 tests and improvement in patient care visits, and we announced we are expanding our work with the U.S. government through a new kitting and storage contract. Our medical-surgical business remains well-positioned to continue to support the government as needed.  The growth in our Medical-Surgical segment is reflective of strong top line performance and underlying business improvement. As it relates to International, the segment had solid adjusted operating profit growth benefiting from both local COVID programs, and a new partnership with one of Canada's largest retailers. We're partnering with local governments to distribute and administer COVID-19 vaccine, and through September, we've distributed over 58 million vaccines to administration sites in select markets across our international geographies. As a reminder, excluding our planned divestitures in Europe, we have businesses in Norway, Austria, Denmark, and Canada in our International segment. For our remaining European businesses, we are exploring strategic alternatives as we align future investments to our growth strategies.  Before I close, I would like to update you on the status of the proposed opioid settlement. Recently, we announced that enough states have agreed to settle to proceed to the next phase, which is the subdivision sign on period. During this phase, each participating state will offer its political subdivisions, including those that have not sued, the opportunity to participate in the settlement for an additional 120-day period, which ends January 2nd 2022. We are pleased with this important step, and we believe the settlement framework will allow us to focus our attention and resources on the safe and secure delivery of medications and therapies, while expediting the delivery of meaningful relief to the effected communities. In closing, I'm encouraged as we continue to make progress and accelerate growth as we advance our Company priorities.  Our underlying distribution business have stable fundamentals, great teams, and strong execution. We're investing in what we believe are 2 good growth markets where we have differentiated capabilities and we look forward to sharing more of those successes and Proofpoint's with you at our upcoming Investor Day. Thank you for your time. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Britt for a few additional comments.
Britt Vitalone: Thank you, Brian. And Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to discuss our fiscal second quarter results, which reflects strong performance and momentum across the business driven by operational excellence and execution against our growth strategies. This momentum can be seen in each of our segments.  A summary of our second quarter results and updated guidance assumptions can be found in our earnings slide presentation, which is posted on the Investors section of our website. Let me start with an update on Europe. This morning, we announced that we've entered into a definitive agreement to divest our retail and distribution businesses in the UK to Aurelius for approximately $438 million. The ultimate proceeds from this transaction are subject to certain adjustments under the agreement.  Therefore, the proceeds may differ from the announced purchase price. McKesson will continue to operate these businesses, and record revenue and income until the transaction is closed, which is expected to occur in our fourth quarter Fiscal 2022 pursuant to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. The assets involved in this transaction contributed approximately $7.8 billion in revenue, and $64 million in adjusted operating profit in Fiscal 2021. The net assets included in the transaction will be classified as held-for-sale and held-for-sale accounting will be effective beginning with our fiscal 2022, third quarter.  We will re-measure the net assets to the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less cost for sell. And we estimate that this will result in a GAAP only charge of between $700 to $900 million in our third quarter of fiscal 2022. Due to held-for-sale accounting treatment, we will discontinue recording depreciation amortization on the assets involved in the transaction. This impact is not included in the Fiscal 2022 outlook provided today.  This transaction provides us the focus to pursue the growth strategies of oncology and biopharmaceutical services in North America. And as Brian mentioned, we remain committed to a full exit of our European businesses, which includes announced transactions to the Phoenix Group and Relias, as well as our remaining operations in Norway, Austria, and Denmark. Let me now turn to our second quarter results.  Before I provide more details on our second quarter adjusted results, I want to point out two additional items that impacted our GAAP -only results in the quarter. First, we recorded a GAAP -only after-tax charge of $472 million related to our agreement to sell certain European businesses to the Phoenix Group. to account for the re-measurement of the net assets to lower accruing amount of fair value, less cost to sell.  This transaction is expected to close within the next 12 months. Also, during the quarter, we recorded an after-tax loss of $141 million on debt extinguishment related to the successful completion of a bond tender offer. Moving now to our adjusted results for the second quarter, beginning with our consolidated results, which can be found on Slide 7. Our second quarter results were highlighted by strong operating performance, which included record revenue and double-digit adjusted operating profit growth across all segments.  We are encouraged by the ongoing market improvement in both prescription volumes and patient visits, which we observed in our second quarter. These improvements are supported by our strategic agenda, setting us on a path of disciplined growth. In our work to support U.S. government's COVID-19 domestic and international vaccine and kitting efforts continues to contribute to growth in addition to the momentum we have built across the business.  Second quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $6.15, an increase of 28% compared to the prior year. This was -- this result was driven by the contribution for the COVID-19 vaccine and kitting distribution and growth in the medical-surgical solution segment, partially offset by a higher tax rate. Second quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share also includes net pretax gains of approximately $97 million or $0.46 per diluted share associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments, as compared to $49 million in the second quarter of Fiscal 2021. Consolidated revenues of $66.6 billion increased 9% above the prior year, principally driven by growth in U.S. pharmaceutical segment, largely due to increased pharmaceutical volumes, including growth in specialty products, and our largest retail national account customers. And partially offset by branded-to-generic conversions. Adjusted gross profit was $3.3 billion for the quarter, up 12% compared to the prior year. Comparable adjusted gross margin for the quarter was up 10 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses in the quarter increased 4% year-over-year.  And adjusted operating profit of $1.3 billion for the quarter, was an increase of 34% compared to the prior year and reflected double-digit growth in each segment. Interest expense was $45 million in the quarter, a decline of 10% compared to the prior year, driven by the net reduction of debt in the quarter. Our adjusted tax rate was 18.8% for the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. In wrapping up our consolidated results, second quarter diluted weighted average shares were 155.8 million, a decrease of 5% year-over-year.  Moving now to our second quarter segment results, which can be found in Slides 8 through 13, and I'll start with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Revenues were $53.4 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year as increased pharmaceutical volumes, including growth in specialty products and our largest retail national account customers we're partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Adjusted operating profit increased 12% to $735 million, driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems and the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution.  The contribution from our contract with the U.S. government related to the distribution of COVID-19, provided a benefit of approximately $0.28 per share in the quarter, which is above our original expectations. In the Prescription Technology Solution segment, revenues were $932 million, an increase of 40%, driven by higher biopharma service offerings including third-party logistics services, and increased technology service revenue, partially resulting from the growth of prescription volumes. Adjusted operating profit increased 38% to $144 million, driven by organic growth from access in his year-end Solutions. Moving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions, revenues were $3.1 billion, an increase of 23% driven by increased sales of COVID-19 tests and growth in the primary care business. Adjusted operating profit increased 52% to 319 million driven by growth in the primary care business, increased sales of COVID-19 tests. And the contribution from kitting, storage, and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program.  The contribution from our contract with U.S. government related to the kitting, distribution and storage of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines provided a benefit of approximately $0.14 per share in the quarter, which was above our original expectations. Next, let me address our international results. Revenues in the quarter were $9.1 billion, a decrease of 5% primarily driven by the contribution of McKesson's German wholesale business to a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance, partially offset by volume increases in the pharmaceutical distribution and retail businesses. Excluding the impact from the contribution of our German wholesale business, which was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, segment revenue increased 13% year-over-year, and was up 9% on an FX adjusted basis.  Adjusted operating profit increased 41% year-over-year to a $163 million On an FX -adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit increased 34% to a $155 million, driven by the discontinuation of depreciation and amortization on certain European assets classified as held-for-sale beginning in the second quarter of Fiscal 2022. The held-for-sale accounting in our international business contributed $0.13 to adjusted earnings in our second quarter of Fiscal 2022. Moving on to corporate. Adjusted corporate expenses were $83 million, a decrease of 39% year-over-year, driven by gains of approximately $97 million or $0.46 from equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio. This quarter we had fair value adjustments related to multiple portfolio companies within McKesson Ventures. Compared to fiscal 2021, gains from McKesson Ventures contributed $0.24 year-over-year. As previously discussed, it's difficult to predict when gains or losses on our Ventures portfolio companies may occur, and therefore, our practice has been, and will continue to be, to not include Ventures portfolio impacts in our guidance.  We also reported opioid-related litigation expenses of $36 million for the second quarter and anticipate that fiscal 2022 opioid-related litigation expenses will be approximately $155 million. Consistent with the proposed settlement announced in July, we also made the first annual payment into escrow of approximately $354 million during the quarter. Let me now turn to our cash position, which can be found on slide 14. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.2 billion, and for the first 6 months of the fiscal year, we had negative free cash flow of a $109 million. In Q2, we completed several debt transactions. In July, we redeemed a EUR600 million denominated note prior to maturity. In August, we completed a cash-funded up-sized tender offer, which resulted in the redemption of $922 million principal outstanding debt. And finally, we completed a public offering of a note in the principal amount of $500 million at 1.3%. These actions align with our previously stated intent to modestly deliver, and to further strengthen our balance sheet and financial position.  Year-to-date, we made $279 million of capital expenditures, which included investments to support our strategic pillars of Oncology and biopharma services. For the first 6 months of the fiscal year, we returned $1.4 billion in cash to our shareholders through $1.3 billion of share repurchases. and the payment of a $134 million in dividends. We have $1.5 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization and continue to expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to range from 154 to $156 billion for  Fiscal 2022. Let me transition now and speak to our outlook for the remainder of Fiscal 2022. For our full list of Fiscal 2022 assumptions, please refer to slide 16 through 19 in our supplemental slide presentation. As a result of our strong first-half performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are raising our previous adjusted earnings per share guidance range for Fiscal 2022 to $21.95 to $22.55, which is up from our previous range of $19.80 to $20. And $0.40. Our updated outlook for adjusted earnings per diluted share reflects 27.5% to 31% growth from the prior year and our guidance assumes growth across all of our segments.  Additionally, fiscal 2022 adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance includes $2.30 to $3.05 of impacts attributable to the following items: $0.50 to $0.70 related to the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution, which is an increase from the previous range of $0.45 to $0.55; $0.80 to a $1.10 related to the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies, an increase from the previous range of $0.50 to $0.70 as discussed to the recent conference; $0.50 to $0.75 related to COVID-19 tests, impairments for PPE and related products, and approximately $0.49 from gains or losses associated with McKesson.  McKesson Ventures equity investments within our corporate segment year-to-date. Excluding the impacts of these items from both fiscal 2022 guidance and fiscal 2021 results, this indicates 20% to 29% forecasted growth. Let me provide a few additional assumptions related to our guidance. We continue to expect prescription and patient engagement volumes will return to pre -COVID levels in the second half of our Fiscal 2022, which is in line with our original guidance. In the U.S. pharmaceutical segment, we now expect revenue to increase 8% to 11% and adjusted operating profit to deliver 4.5% to 7.5% growth over the prior year. We continue to see stable fundamentals, specifically, our outlook for branded pharmaceutical pricing remains consistent with our original guidance and the prior year of mid-single-digits increases in Fiscal 2022. And our view is that the generics market remains competitive yet stable as our volumes have continued to improve in the September quarter. Our guidance includes contribution related to our roles of centralized distributor for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution. This includes work preparing vaccines for international missions.  Our current outlook remains will mind the volume distribution schedule provided by the CDC and the U.S. government. The current guidance excludes booster shots due to the timing of the recent approvals, as well as vaccines for pediatrics, which has not been approved by the CDC. We will continue to update you on the progress and contribution from this program. When excluding COVID-19 vaccine distribution in the segment, we expect approximately 3% to 6% adjusted operating profit growth. In addition, our investments in our leading and differentiated position in oncology will continue to represent an approximate $0.20 headwind in fiscal 2022. In our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we see revenue growth of 31% to 37% and adjusted operating profit growth of 23% to 29%. This growth reflects the strong service and transactional [Indiscernible] in the business.  Now transitioning to Medical-Surgical, our revenue outlook assumes 8% to 14% growth and adjusted operating profit to deliver 35% to 45% growth over the prior year. As mentioned previously, our outlook includes $0.80 to a $1.10 related to the contribution from the U.S. government's distribution of ancillary supply kits and storage programs, and $0.50 to $0.75 related to COVID-19 tests and PPE impairments in related products. Excluding the impacts from these items from both fiscal 2022 guidance and fiscal 2021 results, this indicates 13% to 19% forecasted growth.  One additional note related to our U.S. distribution businesses. One of the pillars of our enterprise strategy is channel, the ability to attract and retain the best workforce in healthcare. The labor market remains competitive and we've assumed the modest expense impact to ensure there is continued service continuity through the holiday season and the back half of our fiscal year.  Therefore, the guidance that we're providing today includes approximately $0.10 to $0.20 of adjusted operating expense impact for labor investments in our U.S. distribution businesses in the second half of the year. Finally, in the international segment, our revenue guidance is 1% decline to 4% growth as compared to the prior year. As a reminder, this reflects the impact of the contribution of our German wholesale business to a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance.  For adjusted operating profit, our guidance reflects growth in the segment of 39 to 43%, which includes approximately $0.38 of expected adjusted earnings accretion in fiscal 2022 as a result of the held-for-sale accounting related to our agreement to sell certain European assets to the Phoenix Group. It also includes our strong performance in the second quarter and the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution in the segment. Turning now to the consolidated view. Our increased guidance assumes 8% to 11% revenue growth and 18% to 22% adjusted operating profit growth compared to fiscal 2021.  Our full-year adjusted effective tax rate guidance of 18% to 19% remains unchanged. And we anticipate corporate expenses in the range of $610 million to $660 million. On our May 6th earnings call, we outlined an initiative to rationalize office space in North America to increase efficiencies and to support employee flexibility. We've made good progress against this initiative.  And based on this progress, we now expect earlier benefits from these actions, resulting in the realization of annual operating expense savings of approximately $15 million to $25 million in the second half of Fiscal 2022, with annual savings of $50 million to $70 million when fully implemented. These savings will be realized across all of our segments. Let me now turn to cash flow and capital deployment. We expect free cash flow of approximately $3.5 to $3.9 billion in fiscal 2022, which is net of property acquisitions in capitalized software expenses. As a reminder, historically we generate the majority of our cash flows in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year.  This strong cash flow generation provides the financial flexibility to execute a balanced capital allocation approach, investing in our strategies of oncology and biopharma services, positioning our business for long-term growth, while remaining committed to returning capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases. Our investment grade credit rating remains a priority in underpins our financial flexibility. In closing, we are encouraged by our strong performance in the first half of our fiscal year.  The momentum across the business, including our partnership with the U.S. government, positions us to deliver the updated fiscal 2022 outlook provided here today. Finally, we're looking forward to providing additional details on our strategies and the strength of our businesses at our upcoming Investor Day on December 8th. Thank you for your time. And now I'll turn the call over to the Operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. If you would like to signal with questions [Operator Instructions]. If you are joining us today using a speaker phone, please make sure the mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Again, that is star 1, If you would like to ask a question. And we'll pause for just one moment. And we'll take our first question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa Gill: Thanks very much. Good afternoon and congratulations on a great quarter. Britt, I appreciate your comments around what you're seeing as far as wage inflation goes. But one of the other questions we've gotten there as inflation is around, freight costs, can you remind us of how that works between the manufacturer and the drug distributor, and if you will bear any of those costs from a distribution perspective, or is it just the manufacturer that bears that costs? Are you able to pass those on to the customer? Just any color around that would be helpful.
Britt Vitalone: Yes. Thanks for your question, Lisa. Certainly, we will bear some cost for freight. We've been able to pass that on to this point in time, both our pharmaceutical and our medical business. We are responsible for the freight from our distribution locations to our customers. And to this point, we've been able to manage through that without any material impact.  And our guidance for the rest of the year assumes that that will continue. We did call out the incremental labor impact, the investment that we're making to make sure that we have continuity through the rest of the year. But as it relates to freight, we are responsible from [Indiscernible]. Operator, can you get on with the next question please? Operator, can you go ahead to the next question, please.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, you will hear music for just a brief moment while reconnect the speaker's line.
Brian Tyler: Hi Sarah (ph.), this is the McKesson presenter line.
Operator: Please proceed.
Brian Tyler: We'll go ahead and take the next question.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Cherny with Bank of America.
Michael Cherny: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. First of all, the call cut off, so I don't know if you've got a chance to finish Lisa's question on freight. [Indiscernible] if you would to highlight that again. And then I guess just from my perspective, I don't want to get too far ahead of things, especially with the Analyst Day coming up. But I appreciate all the breakout you have on the strong work tied to all the COVID -related elements. I know one of the questions from guests who will come up is what that means into next year.  Given that you outlined some of the benefits that you're seeing specifically this year that [Indiscernible] all it takes we all hope that don't [Indiscernible] growth trajectory into next year. Is there any way to think about that 230 to 305, and how we have to think about that as a whole in terms of your overall growth versus what your core business will continue to do?
Britt Vitalone: Hey, Mike. This is Britt. Thanks for hanging in there. Let me just get back to Lisa's question just to finish that up. We are responsible for the freight from our distribution centers to our customers. To this point this year, we have not had an impact in our financial statements as a result of increased freight and we don't expect any of that in our guidance as well, so just to be clear on that. We did call out for you, investments that we're making in labor in the back half of the year, so that we can ensure the holiday season in the back half of the year for our customers has continuity.  As it relates to your question, Mike, what we've really tried to do here is provide you some clarity on those items that are related to our distribution of COVID vaccines and ancillary kits, as well as the increase that we've seen in COVID test kits which have varied quite a bit from quarter-to-quarter over the last year. We've tried to isolate those for you so that you can have a good view into the operations of our core business. I would remind you that the first quarter this year was lapping a very low quarter from the prior year, which was really the first quarter post the COVID pandemic.  So, the growth that you're seeing this year while strong, includes the first quarter which lapped a very low quarter due to COVID in FY21. We'll provide more detail for you on the core components of each of the segments at our Investor Day. We're very pleased with the performance that we've seen thus far, our core business has performed well. But again, I just would remind you that in addition to that, we did have that low quarter for lap in Q1 of last year.
Michael Cherny: Okay, thank you.
Brian Tyler: What Michael was -- just about the vaccine and kitting operation. We continue to run that operation at the direction of the CDC in accordance with the schedules -- the production schedules that they give us. It's obviously been quite dynamic over the past months. We are prepared and we'll continue to run that operation as long as the CDC sees value in it and asks us to do it.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen.
Charles Rhyee: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a little bit about Prescription Technology Solutions. Obviously, very strong growth here in the quarter and you raised for the full-year outlook. But when we look at the Slide 4 and you talk about the various services within -- in this -- for biopharma services, can you highlight which of the ones are really driving the growth here? Obvious some of it is tied to prescription utilization, and I know that we are still coming out of the COVID period, but maybe any comments around growth among some of these various services, and I guess just a sense on which ones will benefit as we continue to recover from the COVID levels. Thanks.
Brian Tyler: Thank you for the question. Look we're -- we continued -- this business is responsive to absolute levels of activity relative to prescription. volumes in the market. We continue to see benefits from the prior investments we've made and these technology services offerings, we do see a good underlying growth across the portfolio.  Clearly, we've benefited from the recovery in COVID-19 related pandemic volumes. And honestly, some of the policy decisions payers would have made around the way they manage prior authorization, we're really seeing that market return to pre - COVID level conditions and requirements coming out of the payers.  So, we believe as patients continue to start new prescriptions, this business is well-positioned to support -- and support the access and adherence to those medications. and we will continue to invest from that. We are seeing returns on some of the investments we highlighted for you in previous calls and things like AMP. And then we are components of this business that we haven't talked much about, like 3PL and we saw strong 3PL growth in the quarter.
Rachel Rodriguez: Thank you. Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Kevin Caliendo with UBS.
Kevin Caliendo: Hi, thanks for taking my call. So, I was wondering -- it looks like in the slide presentation, the non COVID pharma growth estimate is slightly lower. It's now 3% to 6% versus 5% to 8% at the end of Q1. Can you just walk us through what the delta -- what's changed there? I know part of it is probably labor but it doesn't explain it all. And then maybe do the same for med-surg, which is also now higher than what you saw or expected at the end of Q1.
Brian Tyler: Yes, thanks for that question Kevin. Let me just maybe point out a couple of things. First of all, we're pleased with the continued performance of our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, the momentum there is really good. There’re a couple things that we called out for you or I called out for you in my opening comments.  First of all, the investments that we're continuing to make in our oncology business and Ontada, called that out as a $0.20 headwind year-over-year. And then, as I also talked about and you referenced, the labor investments that we're -- that we made into our business, our U.S. distribution businesses, those two things really had an impact on the growth of U.S. Pharma.  And in our Medical business, we're really pleased with not only the performance against the U.S. government program, and the increase in COVID test kitting, which is really reflective of the strength of our Lab Solutions business. But we're pleased with the performance of our Primary Care business and the core business underneath our Medical business, in addition to labor investment that I called out.  So, both businesses continue to have good momentum. In the case of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, continuing to invest in oncology, as well as the labor investment in our medical business. And really continuing to leverage the strength of the Lab business, and the investments we made there. And we're seeing good performance in our Primary Care business.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next. Eric Percher with Nephron Research.
Eric Percher: Thank you. A question on the brand marketplace or maybe brand pricing in particular. I think you've made it pretty clear that the book is no longer tied in a material way to brand price increases. Given the reimbursement and policy debate going on, can you remind us what your view is of what could happen if we saw a change in list prices, particularly a downward change, and how you may or may not be exposed to that?
Britt Vitalone: Thanks for your question, Eric. Maybe I'll start and take the first part of that question and Brian can maybe respond to the policy piece. You're right. We've continued to evolve our business over really the last several years in terms of tying the services that we provide to our customers and for our manufacturers to the pricing and the agreements that we have. And it is less -- the brand inflation is less impactful than it has been in the past. We've talked about that a lot over the last few years. As it relates to really the policy piece, Brian, I'll maybe let you talk about that.
Brian Tyler: Yeah. Just to build on that comment before we move on, I think 1 of the tenants we've always held through multiple changes in dynamics in the industry over my career here is our services provide real value. And regardless of how, what sorts of mechanisms get changed in the marketplace, we will continue to be paid fair market value for those services.  As it relates to the public policy debate and it's as dynamic now as ever, I suppose, I think the main issues that we're discussing are issues that frankly have been long discussed. We are active at the Company with elected officials on both sides of the aisle on key policy priorities.  We track these discussions very carefully. We're always advocating for the role of care being provided in the community. We obviously have very strong presence in the community channels, but we believe that fundamentally that's where you get the best access, the best care, and equally good quality. We have been at the forefront in many of the experiments, I suppose you could call them.  Think about USAN and our value-based care. We've had robust participation in the oncology care models that's delivered substantial benefit to CMS. So, I think the mix is -- it's really -- it's not exactly clear where this will go. I think we have a lot of assets. We're engaged in the discussion. We'll find a way to navigate through them as they unfold. I mean right now, I think these are issues have been long discussed and well-discussed.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take a -- from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Congratulations. I just have one question. Britt, as we think about the investments in labor that you called out, it sounds like it's a back-half thing. Is it a bonus structure or is it the reset in the wage rates that we should be thinking about as we start thinking about our models for fiscal '23?
Britt Vitalone: Yes. Thanks for the question, Brian.Yeah, we're just going to guide to date Fiscal 2022. We thought that this was an investment that was important for our frontline associates, for our delivery drivers in others, to get us through 2022 with continuity. We're not guiding anything beyond that. So, I think you'd just take this as an important investment to make sure that our customers have the continued service that they would expect them to constitute a holiday season in the back half of the year.
Operator: Thank you. We'll move on to our next question with George Chao, Deutsche Bank.
George Chao: Good afternoon, guys and thanks for taking the call. I guess -- Brian, I would ask you or Britt. I know that you guys have said a bit on the record in the past, just talking about not wanting to enter any big new businesses, but as you continue to retrench your way from Europe with a focus towards the U.S, I guess, is there any rethinking of the capital deployment priorities or an appetite for maybe bigger transactions?
Brian Tyler: Well, I would start by saying that I don't think our overall capital deployment strategy has changed. We take a balanced approach to capital deployment. We want to prioritize strategic growth. We think we've got a really clearly defined strategy. We've laid out what we consider our strategic growth areas. And assuming the alignment to those strategies and assuming they meet our disciplined financial review process and are -- create value for our shareholders, we would love to be deploying capital against those strategies.  We obviously always balance that against returning capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and our modestly growing dividend. But we think we've really identified -- we had a set of differentiated assets in good markets focused in North America that when we execute against, we'll deliver as the long-term growth that we're looking for. So, it's strategic alignment, financial discipline. That's really what drives capital deployment.
Britt Vitalone: And I think what you're seeing your by our actions is a focus on return on invested capital, really making sure that the -- where we allocate capital, it finds the highest returns in the Company and our actions thus far that you've heard us talk about the last couple of quarters have been focused on investing and moving capital away from lower returning assets to higher returning assets, and Brian's point are right on strategy.
Operator: Thank you.
Brian Tyler: Next question.
Operator: From Steven Valiquette with Barclays.
Steven Valiquette: Thanks. Good afternoon everybody. So, within the med-surg segment, clearly a lot of variables driving the strong profit growth there. On Slide 10, you mentioned the increased primary care business as one of those drivers. Are you able to comment just on the current level of patient volumes in the quarter, either as a percent of the pre-COVID baseline, either for your customer base or just your assessment of the overall U.S. marketplace for physician patient visits? Thanks.
Brian Tyler: Yeah. I mean, I will start and Britt can add some comments if he'd like. Obviously, we think about patient visits, we think about elective procedures, you think about Primary Care versus specialty. I would say generally we have been pleased with the market recovery. It's recovering in line with how we expected it to at the outset of the year.  It is -- we think it's continuing to strengthen, but is -- we'll reach in the second half of our year what we call -- I guess people call pre - COVID levels. So, we think we're more or less right in line with our expectations, and we're really pleased with the performance of the Medical-Surgical business.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question please.
Operator: Well comes from Rivka Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Rivka Goldwasser: Yes, hi. Good evening
Brian Tyler: Hi, Rivka.
Rivka Goldwasser: Hi there. So, a quick flop on your last comment, you said pre - COVID levels, second half of your Fiscal year for the med-surg business, how should we think about when do we get to pre - COVID levels for the drug distribution? It sounded like specialty is already there, but how should we think about the segment in its entirety in core? So that was the follow up question. And then you're hosting the Analyst Day in December, so maybe you can you give us a sense of granularity around what should we expect from the day -- next month?
Brian Tyler: You want to start with Pharma and I'll take the --
Britt Vitalone: Yes. I think similar to Medical, we are pleased with the performance of volumes, they are approaching pre-COVID levels in pharmaceutical prescription volumes as we expected. So, I think as we look to the rest of the year, we expect that these prescription volumes will get back to what we guided originally in May, which is in line with those pre-COVID levels.  So, we're continuing to see improved performance and improved volumes across all -- both brands, specialty and as well as generics. We expect that that will continue in the second half year.
Brian Tyler: Britt, as it relates to Investor Day, we are really excited to be able to have an Investor Day. We're going to host it December 8th in New York City. Probably would've done it sooner, but it's been quite a crazy environment for the last 18 or 20 months. In terms of -- well, what we hope to see is we really want to bring some more members of the management team, the executive team that have been leading the results that we've had a great chance to review with you.  The team that's been responsible for developing these strategies, we want to provide just a little bit more insight and granularity into each of our growth strategy, and some of our core distribution businesses. And we plan to begin to outline our long-term growth prospects. So, we think it's going to be a great day. We hope you can all join us.
Rachel Rodriguez: Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. We have one final question from Jailendra Singh, Credit Suisse.
Jailendra Singh: Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions here. Just wanted to make sure I understand what is in and what is not in the guidance respect to vaccine benefit. It seems you're not including the benefit from vaccines designated for kids or boosters short.  Is that true on both vaccine distribution benefit and the benefits related to the kitting, storage and ancillary supplies as well? Just trying to understand if you see a reasonable adoption of boosters and vaccine among kids, will that drive incremental revenue in both bottom-line and med-surg?
Brian Tyler: So, your first part of the question I think answers your question. We are not including -- we have provided guidance based on what the CDC has provided to us. And at this point, that does not include boosters and pediatric vaccines.
Operator: Thank you. And there are no further questions.
Brian Tyler: Okay. Well, thank you, Sarah. And thank you, everyone for the great questions and for joining our call. I want to conclude my remarks today by just underscoring that we're hosting an and Investor Day on December eighth, and we hope everyone will get a chance to join us and tune in, we're going to have our leadership team there.  The team that's been responsible for building the momentum and the business, and executing the strategies that have been put in place. We will spend some quality time on our oncology and biopharma strategic growth pillars.  I think it's going to be a great day. We're really excited to be with everyone and see you. I also don't want to let this call lapse without thanking the McKesson team for their incredible work and their dedication as we round out the first half of our fiscal year. That's where the real work gets done and I'm so proud of them. So, thanks everyone. I hope you have a great evening.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.

===== 2022 Q1  (2021-08-04 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the McKesson Q1 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to you, Holly Weiss. Please go ahead.
Holly Weiss: Thank you, Jenny. Good afternoon and welcome everyone, to McKesson's First Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, such as forecasts about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's press release and our slide presentation and to the Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Additional information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results, is included in today's press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website at investor.mckesson.com. With that, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Holly, and good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for joining us on our first quarter call today. We are pleased to be reporting a strong start to our fiscal 2022, which reflects continued operating momentum across our businesses despite the fact that our markets are still recovering from the impacts of COVID-19. We're also making significant progress against our strategic priorities and our commitment to do what's in the best interests of you, our shareholders. Before we get to our first quarter results, I want to provide an update on the progress made towards a broad resolution of governmental opioid related claims. On July 21, we announced that McKesson along with two other distributors negotiated a comprehensive proposed settlement agreement, which if all conditions are satisfied, that results in the settlement of a substantial majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities. This broad resolution -- this broad agreement becomes effective. The agreement reached between the distributors and the state of New York and its participating subdivisions to settle opioid related claims will become part of this broader settlement agreement. Under the negotiated proposed settlement agreement and subject to final state territorial and political subdivision participation, McKesson will pay up to $7.9 billion over a period of 18 years. Over the next several months, we will monitor participation of the eligible governmental entities to determine if participation levels are sufficient to proceed. This is an important development. And I'm pleased with the progress we've made after years of negotiations. For able to reach a final settlement, it would provide immediate relief to 1000s of communities across the United States that have been impacted by this public health crisis. While we strongly dispute the allegations made in these lawsuits, we believe that bringing resolution to these outstanding claims is in the best interest of those impacted by this crisis. We also believe resolution is in the best interest of our shareholders, and will allow us to further focus on the business and our role in protecting the safety and the integrity of the pharmaceutical supply chain. We remain committed to doing our part to fight against the opioid epidemic through efforts to continuously enhance our anti diversion programs and to advocate for reform at the state and national level. As settlement cannot be finalized or plaintiffs instead choose to pursue their claims in court, we are prepared to litigate against those claims, and we remain confident in our defenses. We also recently announced that we entered into an agreement to sell several of our McKesson, Europe businesses to the PHOENIX group who we believe is the right and natural successor to McKesson, and the ideal leader of these European businesses going forward. The agreement includes our McKesson Europe businesses in France, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Belgium and Slovenia, as well as our German Ag headquarters in Stuttgart, our shared service center in Lithuania, our German wound care business and our equity stake in our joint venture in the Netherlands. This transaction is expected to close in fiscal 2023, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals. Our remaining European businesses in the UK, Norway, Austria and Denmark were not included in this transaction and will continue to be operated by McKesson. However, we are exploring strategic alternatives for these remaining businesses as we align future investments to our growth strategies outside of Europe. We believe fully active in Europe is another step towards becoming a more streamlined and efficient organization. Let me turn now to our performance in the quarter. We are continuing to see the operating momentum we discussed in our fourth quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. Today, we're reporting adjusted earnings per diluted share of $5.56. Ahead of our original expectations, resulting from the strength across our businesses and our roles in the COVID-19 response efforts across the geographies in which we operate. Our US and international distribution businesses are playing an integral role in the pandemic response and our operational excellence and capabilities continue to be highlighted through our evolving partnership with the US government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution efforts. Through July, our US pharmaceutical business has successfully distributed over 185 million Moderna and J&J. COVID-19 vaccines to administration sites across the United States. And our medical business has now assembled enough kits to support the administration of more than 785 million doses for all vaccine types. Also in the quarter, the US government asked McKesson to support their mission of sending millions of COVID-19 vaccines to countries in need all around the globe. We are picking and packing with Moderna and Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccines and the temperature controlled coolers and preparing these vaccines for pickup by international partners, all at the direction of the US government. McKesson is not managing the actual shipments of vaccines to other countries. Through July, we've successfully prepared over 65 million COVID-19 vaccines for shipment abroad. We are humbled and honored to serve the US government in this expanded role. Our roles in Europe and Canada are also continuing to evolve and we're partnering with local governments to distribute and administer COVID-19 vaccines there as well. Through July, we've distributed over 45 million vaccines to administration sites in select markets across the geographies. Based on our first quarter results, our evolving roles in the COVID-19 response efforts at our confidence in our outlook for the remainder of our fiscal 2022, we are raising our adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance to $19.80 to $20.40 from a previous range of $18.85 to $19.45. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're making significant progress against our strategic priorities. We're simplifying the portfolio and increasing our focus on areas where we have deep expertise and that are central to our long-term growth strategy. Our progress to date is underpinned by execution against our top company priorities. The first is a focus on the people and the culture. The second is our commitment to strengthen the core pharmaceutical and medical supply chain businesses. The third are intentional efforts to simplify and streamline the business. And finally to continue to invest to advance our differentiated oncology and biopharma services ecosystems. Let me now touch briefly on the progress we're making across each of these priorities. First and foremost, we're prioritizing our people and advancing our company's culture as we strive to be recognized as an impact driven organization, and the best place to work in healthcare. We've been hard at work to transform and energize our company's culture. Our ICARE and ILEAD value serve as the foundation as we work toward our common goal, advancing health outcomes for all. As an organization, we're committed to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion. For the sixth consecutive year, McKesson was named a Best Place to Work for disability inclusion; McKesson earned a top ranking score of 100 on the 2021 disability equality index. In addition, we marked progress in diverse representation in the US with female executive representation of 3% over the prior year, and a 6% gain over the prior year in executive representation for persons of color. Our second company priority is to strengthen our core distribution businesses where we have market leading scale and capabilities across North America. Success in the core enables strong cash flow generation, which we in turn use to reinvest in the business and to return capital to our shareholders. In addition to our work to help our customers and government partners in their pandemic response efforts, our pharmaceutical and medical surgical distribution businesses are continuing to improve and the recovery from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic has been in line with our expectations. Elective procedures and primary care visits have improved throughout our first quarter. The prescription volume trends are showing signs of improvement as well. Also positive or the trends we've seen across specialty and oncology patient visits, which were at or above pre COVID baselines in the first quarter, and distribution volumes to our specialty provider customers continue to drive and support our growth. In our Canadian distribution business, our operational excellence and scale was recently recognized through a new partnership with one of Canada's largest retailers as a primary distribution customer. This is a testament to the strength of our supply chain in Canada. Renewed focus on growing the core has been enabled by our commitment to streamline the business over the past several years, efforts that go beyond a recent announcement to exit the European region, which I commented on my opening remarks. Over the past several years, we've committed to transforming our operating model we've centralized back office functions across North America and Europe to further rationalized costs through reduction of our own retail pharmacy footprint and a commitment to lower spend across the organization. Throughout our enterprise, it's an initiative we called Spend Smart which helped us achieve our three year cost reduction target of $400 million to $500 million of annual cost savings by the end of our fiscal 2021. Over time, we've identified businesses that are not central to McKesson's current strategic priorities or direction, as was the case in our exit of our physician and change healthcare and the creation of a German wholesale joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance; we will continually review our portfolio to ensure tight and focused on alignment to our strategy. All this work has enabled us to focus our time and investments on our strategic growth pillars, where we're working to build connected ecosystems in the growth areas of oncology and biopharma services, which should serve to advance our already differentiated positions. We continue to be confident in the long-term outlook of businesses that operate in these high growth markets, starting with oncology and ecosystem that McKesson has strategically built over a period of nearly 15 years, beginning with our acquisition of Oncology Therapeutics Network, all the way back in 2007, which added at that time core specialty distribution capabilities. 10 years ago, we deepen the breadth and the depth of our offering with the acquisition of US Oncology Network, which gave us practice management, site management for research and the iKnowMed EHR which is one of the foundational pieces of on Ontada. Fast forward to today and we're now supporting over 14,000 specialty physicians through distribution and GPO services. We're also the leading distributor in the community oncology space and have over 1,400 physicians in the US and college networks spread over approximately 600 sites of care in the US. As innovative specialty therapies come to market our leading position in oncology distribution enabled us to grow our connected oncology ecosystem in parallel. As we grow, our non-affiliated and our US oncology provider basis, we accelerate the growth of our oncology assets such as GPO services practice management, site management for clinical research, specialty pharmacy, and our value proposition for Ontada where we're providing real world insight to both manufacturers and providers. Although in its infancy, Ontada value is being recognized through expanded partnerships with manufacturers such as Amgen and its leading role in a large scale real world research study known as MYLUNG, which aims to improve treatments and outcomes for non small cell lung cancer. New therapies coming to market can also provide additional challenges for patients' providers and our biopharma partners. Our Prescription Technology Solutions business invest in innovation and aims to provide access, adherence and affordability solutions for over 500 brands across nearly every therapeutic area. Our connectivity to over 50,000 pharmacies, 750,000 providers and 75% of VAHR in the US, helps enable over $5 billion of prescription savings for patients each year. Prescription Technology Solutions ended fiscal 2021 with solid momentum. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022 we saw organic growth in the business and encouraging signs that patient engagement levels and prescription volume trends are continuing to improve. Our market leading technology offerings are helping patients get access to therapies they need more quickly and efficiently and stay on those therapies longer to get better health outcomes. In closing, we believe that we've made significant strides against our strategic priorities of strengthening the core, simplifying the business and investing in our growth areas of oncology and biopharma services. Announcing the proposed opioid settlement agreement is an important development. In addition, our strategic intent to exit the European region positions us to become a more focused and agile. We believe both are in the best interest of our employees, in the best interest of our customers and in the best interest of our shareholders, while it's early in the fiscal year, and then pandemic continues to present unknowns, I'm confident in the fundamentals of the business, and believe we are positioned well for long-term growth. And we'll look to build upon this momentum over the remainder of our fiscal 2022. Thank you for your time. And with that, I'll turn it over to you Britt for a few additional comments.
Britt Vitalone: Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to speak to you today about our strong first quarter results which reflecting importance of the products and services McKesson delivers, the execution and momentum across our business, which includes supporting US government's COVID-19 domestic and international vaccine and kitting efforts, and the recovery of prescription volumes and patient visits impacted by the COVID pandemic in the prior year. I'll begin my remarks today by sharing an update on our European businesses, followed by our first quarter results, and I'll close with an update for fiscal 2022 outlook. The summary of our first quarter results and updated guidance assumptions can be found in our earnings slide presentation, which is posted on the investor section of our website. In early July, we announced an agreement to sell our European businesses in France, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Belgium and Slovenia to the PHOENIX group. This transaction includes our German Ag headquarters in Stuttgart, and our European shared service center in Lithuania. The purchase price for the transaction was approximately US $1.5 billion. The ultimate proceeds for this transaction are subject to certain adjustments under the agreement. Therefore the proceeds may differ from the purchase price. The assets involved in this transaction contributed approximately $12 billion in revenue and $75 million in adjusted operating profit in fiscal 2021. We've determined that this transaction shall not qualify for discontinued operations. And that asset included in the transaction we've classified as held for sale, and held for sale accounting is affected at the start of our second quarter of this fiscal year. We will re-measure the net assets to the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell. And we estimate that this will result in a GAAP only charge between $500 million to $700 million in our second quarter of fiscal 2022. Due to help for sale accounting treatment we will discontinue recording depreciation amortization on the assets involved in the transaction. As a result of the help for sale accounting, we would guide to approximately $0.26 adjusted earnings accretion in fiscal 2022. This will be included in our updated outlook. And I'll outline those later in my remarks. McKesson will operate these businesses and record revenue and income until the transaction is closed, which is expected to occur in fiscal 2023. We're committed to exploring strategic alternatives for our remaining European businesses. And we'll provide details on the plans for the remaining businesses as they become available. Exiting Europe at this time is the right course of action for McKesson and our shareholders. And it'll sharpen the focus on our growth strategies in oncology and biopharma services. As we develop and grow a connected ecosystem. Let me now turn to our first quarter results. Before I provide more details on our first quarter adjusted results. I want to point out two items that impacted our GAAP only results in the quarter. First, during the June quarter, we committed to donate certain Personal Protective Equipment and related products to charitable organizations to assist in COVID-19 recovery efforts. In the quarter, we recorded $155 million of pretax inventory charges within our medical-surgical solution segment for inventory which no longer intend to sell, and will instead direct the previously mentioned charitable organizations. And secondly, on our May 6 earnings call, we outlined an initiative to rationalize office space in North America to increase efficiencies and support increased employee flexibility. These actions will result in the realization of annual operating expense savings of approximately $60 million to $80 million when fully implemented. Our guidance does not assume a material benefit in fiscal 2022. In the June quarter, we reported approximately $95 million of charges associated with this initiative. Moving now to our adjusted results for the first quarter, beginning with our consolidated results, which can be found on slide 7? First quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share were $5.56, an increase of 101% compared to the prior year. This result was driven by the recovery in prescription volumes and primary care patient visits from the COVID-19 pandemic, as we lap the most significant pandemic impacts in lockdowns Q1 of fiscal 2021; it also included a lower tax rate, and the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution and kitting programs, with the US government. Consolidated revenues of $62.7 billion increased 13% to the prior year, driven by growth in the US pharmaceutical segment, largely due to higher volumes from retail and national account customers, and price increases on branded and specialty pharmaceuticals, which is partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Adjusted gross profit was $3.1 billion for the quarter, up 19% compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses in the quarter increased 6% year-over-year led higher operating expenses to support growth in our core businesses and strategic investments, partially offset by the contribution of our German wholesale business to the joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. Adjusted operating profit was $1.1 billion for the quarter, an increase of 55% compared to the prior year, which reflects double digit growth in each segment. Interest expense was $49 million in the quarter, a decline of 18% compared to the prior year, driven by the retirement of approximately $1 billion of long-term debt in fiscal 2021. Our adjusted tax rate was 11.3% for the quarter due to discrete tax items that were reported during the quarter. Our full year adjusted effective tax rate guidance of 18% to 19% remains unchanged. And our first quarter diluted weighted average shares were 158 million, a decrease of 3% year-over-year, driven by $1 billion of shares repurchased in the first quarter. Moving now to our first quarter segment results, which can be found on slide 8 through 12? And I'll start with US Pharmaceutical. Revenues were $50 billion, an increase of 12% driven by higher volumes in retail and national account customers and price increases on branded and specialty pharmaceuticals, partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased 16% to $682 million, driven by the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution and growth in Specialty Products distribution to our providers and healthcare systems, which was partially offset by higher operating costs, and supported a company's oncology growth initiative.  Turning to Prescription Technology Solutions, we're very pleased with the strong growth and scale that we're building in this higher margin segment. The drivers for our Prescription Technology Solutions businesses continue to move in the right direction. First, we're seeing expansion in many of our services businesses, as we continue to add more manufacturing partners and programs for our existence solutions, such as electronic prior authorization, or access and adherence services, and 3PL. Second, our technology based platforms like Relay Health, support $19 billion clinical and financial transactions annually. From claims routing and the growing discount card market to alerts and adec that make the practice of pharmacy clinically safer and administratively more efficient. And we continue to invest in innovate to build a connected ecosystem of biopharma services, our next generation access and adherence solution, AMP is showing accelerated adoption in growth with new brands. This year, AMP is bringing its network enabled approach to hub services into support for oncology and specialty drugs covered under the medical benefit. We also continue to expand our clinical decision support capabilities in provider office workflow across every major HER. Our technology network stands at every touch point in the patient journey from doctor's office to benefit verification to dispensing pharmacy, which allows us to address barriers in the patient journey by adding unique automation that accelerates timed therapy and lowers patient out of pocket costs. In the June quarter, revenues were $881 million, an increase of 34% and adjusted operating profit increased 62% to $139 million, driven by higher volumes of technology and service offerings to support biopharma customers, organic growth from access and generic solutions and recovery of prescription volumes from the COVID-19 pandemic. Moving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions, revenues were $2.5 billion in the quarter, up 40% driven by improvements in primary care patient visits and increased sales of COVID-19 tests. Contribution per contract with US government to prepare and distribute ancillary supplies related to the COVID-19 vaccine provided a benefit of approximately $0.25 in the quarter, and we're above our original expectations. For the quarter, adjusted operating profit increased 107% to $257 million driven by improvements in primary care patient visits, and the contribution from kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for the US government's COVID-19 vaccine program. Next, let me speak about international, revenues in the quarter were $9.2 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year, excluding the impact from the divestiture of our German wholesale business, segment revenue increased 28% year-over-year, and was up 14% on an FX adjusted basis. Revenue was primarily driven by the contribution of our German wholesale business joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance, which was completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and the recovery of pharmaceutical distribution retail pharmacy volumes, and the COVID-19 pandemic. First quarter adjusted operating profit increased 133% year-over-year to $170 million. On an FX-adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit increased 107% to $151 million led by the recovery of pharmaceutical distribution and retail pharmacy volumes from the COVID-19 pandemic, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and test kits in Europe and Canada. Moving on to corporate; for the quarter adjusted corporate expenses were $154 million, a decrease of 7% year-over-year, driven by decreased opioid litigation expenses. We reported opioid related litigation expenses of $35 million for the first quarter; we continue to estimate fiscal 2022 opioid related litigation expenses to approximate $155 million. I would remind you that while we've negotiated a comprehensive proposed settlement agreement until we know the scope of participation in proposed settlement, you're not in a position to revise our opioid litigation expenses outlook. Let men now turn to our cash position which can be found on slide 14. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.4 billion. During the quarter, we had negative free cash flow of $1.8 billion. As a reminder, we're working capital metrics and resulting free cash flow vary from quarter-to-quarter, and were impacted by timing including the day in a week that marks the close of a given quarter. We made $159 million of capital expenditures in the quarter, which includes investments in technology data and analytics to support our strategic initiatives of oncology and biopharma services. As our business performed at a very high level, we were also able to return $1.1 billion of cash to our shareholders in the June quarter. This included $1 billion of share repurchases pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase program, which resulted in an initial delivery of 4.3 million shares in the quarter. Additionally, we paid $69 million in dividends. We have $1.8 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. And we're updating our guidance for diluted weighted shares outstanding, to range from $154 million to $156 million for fiscal 2022, which incorporates plans; repurchase an additional $1 billion of stock over the remainder of the fiscal year. Let me transition and speak to our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2022. For a full list of fiscal 2022 assumptions, please refer to slide 16 through 19 in our supplemental slide presentation, I'll begin by reiterating a couple of key macro level assumptions that underpin our fiscal 2022 outlook. We expect prescription and patient engagement volumes will demonstrate steady improvement from the levels at the end of our fiscal 2021 through the first half of our fiscal 2022 and return to pre COVID levels in the second half of our fiscal 2022. For fiscal 2022, our updated guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share is a range of $19.80 to $20.40, up from our previous range of $18.85 to $19.45, approximately equally split between our first and second half of the fiscal year. Our updated outlook for adjusted earnings per diluted share reflects 15% to 18.5% growth from the prior year. And our guidance assumes core growth across all of our segments. In the US Pharmaceutical segment, we now expect revenue to increase 5% to 8% and adjusted operating profits to deliver 4.5% to 7.5% growth over the prior year. Our US Pharmaceutical segment continues to exhibit stable fundamentals. Our outlook for branded pharmaceutical pricing remains consistent with the prior year for mid single digit increases in fiscal 2022. And the generics market remains competitive yet stable, as volumes have shown signs of recovery. COVID-19 vaccine contribution contributed approximately $0.30 in the first quarter of fiscal '22. We are updating our full year outlook to approximately $0.45 to $0.55. The $0.45 to $0.55 range reflects an anticipated contribution of earnings for the fair value of services performed at the US government centralized distributor of COVID-19 vaccines, including work preparing vaccines for international missions. Our current outlook remains aligned to the volume distribution schedule provided by the CDC and the US government, which excludes booster shots and vaccines for pediatrics, which have not been approved by the FDA. We will continue to invest in our leading and differentiated physicians in oncology. These investments will represent an approximate $0.20 headwind in fiscal 2022. Normalizing for the COVID-19 vaccine distribution and our ongoing growth investments, we continue to expect approximately 5% to 8% core adjusted operating profit growth. In our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we see revenue growth of 20% to 25%, and adjusted operating profit growth of 17% to 22%. This growth reflects the opportunities we see to accelerate service and transaction contributions, benefiting from our technology platforms.  Now transitioning to Medical-Surgical, we continue to partner with the US government under our contract for the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies and are updating our outlook to $0.35 to $0.45 of contribution in the segment related to kitting and distribution. This program scope and duration is evolving and our updated assumptions reflect the current outlook provided by the US government. Our revenue outlook assumes the 3% decline to 3% growth and adjusted operating profit to deliver 6% to 12% growth over the prior year. We continue to expect year-over-year core adjusted operating profit growth of approximately 10% to 16%. Finally, in the international segment, our revenue guidance is 1% decline to 4% growth as compared to the prior year. And as a reminder, this reflects the contribution of our German wholesale business to a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. For adjusted operating profit, our guidance's growth in segment of 26% to 30% due to the previously mentioned benefit in the discontinuation of depreciation and amortization, which followed the announcement of our agreement to sell certain European assets. Our strong performance in the first quarter and the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution in the segment.  Turning now to the consolidated view, our guidance assumes 4% to 7% revenue growth and 7% to 10% adjusted operating profit growth compared to fiscal 2021. We continue to expect corporate expenses in the range of $670 million to $720 million. Let me now turn to cash flow and capital deployment. We were pleased to recently announce the completion of cash funded upside tender offer. This successful tender offer resulted in the early retirement of $922 million of our outstanding debt. Additionally, we announced the early retirement of a €600 million note for a total reduction in debt of approximately $1.6 billion. These actions occurred during the beginning of our second quarter. It further strengthened our balance sheet and financial position, and they are in line with our previously stated intent to modestly delever. And as a result of these actions we are updating our interest expense guidance for fiscal 2022 to $180 million to $200 million. We're also reiterating our free cash flow guidance of approximately $3.5 billion to $3.9 billion, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses. Last quarter, I mentioned that we anticipated the use of cash to purchase shares of McKesson Europe through exercises of the foot rate option available to non controlling shareholders that expired in June of fiscal 2022. The remaining foot rate options resulted in payments of approximately $1 billion in the quarter, which was generally in line with our expectations. As a reminder, this is reflected in the financing activities section of our cash flow statement. As a result of this activity, McKesson holds approximately 95% of McKesson Europe's outstanding common shares. And we anticipate income attributable to non controlling interest in the range of $175 million to $195 million in fiscal 2022. Our commitment to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases was recently highlighted by our board's approval of a 12% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.47 per share. And our fiscal 2022 guidance continues to include share repurchases of approximately $2 billion for the full year. In closing, we're pleased with the strong results of our first quarter; we remain focused on driving growth as we invest against the strategic high growth opportunities in oncology and biopharma services. This focus combined with our commitment to further evolve the portfolio will drive significant value to our customers, shareholders and patients. Our outlook for fiscal '22 reflects this focus and execution with healthy adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share growth and return of capital to our shareholders. With that, Holly, let me turn it back to you for Q&A.
Holly Weiss: Thank you, Britt. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies.
BrianTanquilut: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Congrats on a very strong quarter. I guess, Britt, as I think about the guidance, it looks like it assumes a lower margin profile. Just curious what you're thinking in terms of any puts and takes in the margins as we look forward to the next three quarters.
BrittVitalone: Yes, Brian, thanks for that question. No, I would remind you that this is our first quarter, and we had a very strong first quarter. We're still in an evolving environment; we're very encouraged by the utilization trends and the improvement that we're seeing, as we think about our US Pharmaceutical business. Our growth, as I mentioned in my remarks was driven in large part by the growth of our largest customers. So that does impact the mix. And it certainly impacted the mix in the first quarter. In our RxTS business, we have very healthy growth, as I mentioned across all of our different capabilities and some of the growth that we're seeing in that business there. Again, mix impacted by some of our 3PL growth, we're very encouraged by the growth of our access and adherence solutions, particularly our AMP product. But I think as you think about this, it is really a reflection of the first quarter. It's a reflection of the continued improvement in utilization. And it's a reflection of some mix within some of our segments.
Operator: We will go next to Steven Valiquette of Barclays Bank.
StevenValiquette: Great, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I guess if we go back to when McKesson acquired the European assets, seven, eight years ago, one of the drivers of the deal was to increase McKesson's generic drug purchasing power, I guess by announcing the sale to PHOENIX. My sense is you're probably not too worried about any dis synergies related to less generic purchasing power, you wouldn't do the transactions. I guess I'm just curious to hear a little more about the McKesson's purchasing power today, whether it's ClarusONE or other factors such that the additional European purchasing power as well as critical, and just to make sure we are not missing anything around this to hopefully well, I guess, is there any post deal agreement between McKesson and PHOENIX and generic purchasing collaboration? Or was that even explored? Thanks.
BrianTyler: Thank you for the questions. Maybe I'll start, I mea if you wind the clock back to almost a decade ago, when we expanded into Europe. I think there were multiple elements for the company to strategically go to Europe, one of them; one of many was the opportunity to make sure we stayed leading in our generics procurement capabilities and scale. I think over the last years, we continue to invest in that capability. We have a very successful partnership in ClarusONE and we're very confident that we have not just the scale but also the procurement expertise. And then we have a very contemporary generic procurement operation that will continue to be a leading generic operation after the divestiture of the European assets that we've discussed. So we're quite confident in our -- the productivity and the yield results we see from ClarusONE and we believe that will continue to be the case into the future.
Operator: Next we will go to Michael of Bank of America.
MichaelCherny: Good afternoon, congratulations on the quarter. I just want to dive in and get a little bit more on the pharma distribution outlook, clear the results are strong in the quarter, it claims towards higher record growth on a go forward basis. As you think about the dynamics in the market, maybe aside from the ClarusONE question, but what has been the pace and health of recovery of your non large national chain customers? You call them out as specific contributors to the quarter, can you give us a sense about how the rest of your book of business or rest of your customers are handling the potential or hopefully recovering utilization across their platforms and where the factors in terms of your outlook for the rest of the year?
BrianTyler: Sure, Michael, start with a couple of comments. So first off, we are pleased at the trajectory of the recovery that we have seen. And we, it's been more or less in alignment with the expectations we set out at the beginning of the year. And I think it's not just isolated to a particular segment. I think if you look at the market overall, we continue to see really through the first quarter, steady progression along the trend line that we signaled we thought would be the case. So we're very, we continue to be encouraged by that; we continue to think that we will reach full recovery, meaning pre COVID levels in the second half of our fiscal year, obviously we tracked the trends regularly. If we saw something that would cause us to deviate from that we would be sure to share it with you. But right at this point in time, the recovery has been more or less in line with how we thought. We're very pleased about that and we expect that we will get to the full recovery in the second half of this fiscal year.
BrittVitalone: Maybe I would just add that I think the balance of our customers and the channels that we serve, and what we're seeing in those various channels is reflected in the guidance that we gave you a 5% to 8% operating profit growth. So all of the channels are recovering. They're recovering, as Brian mentioned in line with our expectations, and they're all contributing to that overall core operating profit growth. 
Operator: We will go next to Lisa Gill of JPMorgan.
LisaGill: Thank you and let me add my congratulations as well. Brian and Brett, I just want understand biosimilars. So you talk just now about operating profit, how much of an impact are biosimilars having and then as we think about the comments, Brian, that you made both around oncology and bio services, how do we think about that going forward, especially on the oncology side. What types of investments are you making, how important are biosimilars as these programs are going to make acquisitions? How do we think about that?
BrianTyler: Thank you for the question, Lisa. I'll maybe start with biosimilars, and then round into the oncology question. I mean biosimilars we think we are very well positioned, given our strength in the specialty business and including the oncology elements of that. It's still from our perspective is fairly early days, there's just under a dozen in the marketplace today, we think the pipeline does look good and that given the assets we have in oncology and biopharma and our footprint in the specialty space, we will benefit from that and we have seen a growing impact of biosimilars over the last several quarters. As it relates to oncology, we use the word ecosystem. And that's really just to try to introduce this notion that there are many assets that McKesson has that relate to our oncology businesses, whether it's just distribution, specialty distribution, GPOs, health economics outcome research, the latest addition to that portfolio of assets is the data and insights business that we call Ontada. And when we think of the oncology ecosystem, we think of these as all kind of self reinforcing and adding momentum to each other. We add providers that add scale to GPO that adds more customers and data to Ontada, as Ontada matures, as partnerships expand and we get more insights, we funnel that back a to provider which makes us a more attractive solution provider to them. So that's really how we're thinking about it. It's each into themselves is a good business, we think, but together we think there's real differentiation and strength.
BrittVitalone: And Lisa, I just add on that we're really pleased with the development of biosimilars are really adding to the operating profit growth in the segment. It's growing. Over time, we think that it will continue to grow. And the channel matters where we have more services to provide. As Brian mentioned, GPO services, a good example of that, certainly is more profitable for us and we'll see higher adoption rates, the adoption rates continue to build. And that I think is reflective of the growing operating profit contribution that we're seeing from biosimilars. But we do think longer term, there's a larger opportunity.
Operator: Next will be Eric Percher of Nephron Research.
EricPercher: Thank you. The International DNA dynamics are interesting. Thank you for that detail. Maybe a two parter, Britt. One is when we think about the remaining European business, can you provide us some sense of scale? I think the last time we got a salacious number without Canada was around $230 million about profit. And then on the DNA, could the same circumstances exist for the remaining EU business? Should you get to a sale?
BrittVitalone: Yes, great questions, Eric. And thank you for those questions. And we're not going to break out the international business into a piece parts, which is something that we're ready to do at this point in time. And I would just say that every transaction that could happen in the future we will evaluate that based on the facts of the transaction for this particular transaction, we deemed that these assets would be in the health for sale perspective, but I can't really comment on what future transactions might look like, it's difficult to know how those transactions may or may not come together and what the specific details would be. Next question, operator?
Operator: And next will be Charles Rhyee of Cowen.
CharlesRhyee: Yes, thanks for taking question. Just wanted, Britt, just talk about the guidance here for the remainder of the year. Obviously, the large upside performance of the quarter, at least relative to what I think consensus was expecting, maybe if you could talk about how this came in, at least relative to what you're expecting coming into this quarter. And as we think about the rest of the year, if I looked at the pieces, it seems like we're getting a benefit from the DNA also a tax benefit. Is that really the big drivers here relative to your expectations coming in? And maybe any kind of thoughts around that as we think about the remainder of the year, relative to how you guys were? Your plan came in? Thanks.
BrittVitalone: Yes, thank you for that question. Maybe I'll just start with, as you look at some of our macro assumptions, we talked about these in May, that we assumed that we would continue to see growing patient activity and prescription volumes, we saw that in the first quarter. And so that was in line with our expectations, we see that continuing to build and continuing to improve. And so just from a very macro utilization perspective, we're seeing improvement that we expected to see where we're seeing it on the trajectory that we expected to see. And so we're very encouraged by that. Our businesses, each of our segments had very strong performance. And so we're very encouraged by that. It is our first quarter; certainly utilization will continue to evolve over the rest of the year. But we're very encouraged by that, the strong operating performance, the utilization that we're seeing; the patient activity that we're seeing, we expect that will continue along lines that we thought it would certainly the vaccine distribution and kitting program continues to evolve, and it was a little bit higher than we had anticipated. We've increased the guide for that, generally speaking, utilization is strong. It's in line with what our expectations were. And we expect that will continue through the remainder of the year. And you'd ask the question on tax. The one thing that I will remind you on taxes, we don't guide tax by quarter, we guide you on an annual basis. We did not change our guidance for the full year effective tax rate. And I think if you look over the last few years, the annual guidance around the tax rate that we've given is pretty much been in line with the original guide.
Operator: And we'll go to Kevin Caliendo of UBS.
KevinCaliendo: Thanks for taking my call. So I want to ask the guidance question a little bit differently because it is unusual for McKesson to sort of raise guidance for all the segments right after the first quarter and I'm wondering if it's just something about the way if it's COVID related or not, but I mean to raise your revenue expectations for all of your segments versus what you guided to just a couple months ago. Is there anything else specific? Was it just conservatism on your part? Because we can't just point to script growth or patient volume, it's got to be some sort of larger macro thing happening here that's driving this. And I know you've kind of addressed it, but maybe talk specifically about the conservatism or when you went into the year, what was the overhang that possibly lifted that allowing you to do this across the board?
BrittVitalone: Well, let me start, appreciate the question and maybe phrase it a little bit differently. We don't provide conservative guidance, as we provide guidance is based on what we see in our markets and what we're seeing within our businesses. I would remind you that when we gave you our guidance, one of the things that we talked about is that the markets that we operate in had not fully recovered. And so we're coming off a year of one of the most dynamic environments that we've ever operated in. And when we provided that guidance, we were very clear that our market had not fully recovered. We expected that they would, but certainly it was going to evolve over time. Our businesses continue to operate at a very high level. And I think you saw that in the performance this quarter. We're very encouraged by the utilization trends that we see. We're very encouraged by the performance that each of the businesses has shown. And we're seeing really good reaction and response to a lot of the products that we have, it's specifically in the RxTS business as an example. So I think what you're seeing is an environment that is continuing to recover, not necessarily on an even basis over the last year and a half in a business that is performing very well in those situations.
Operator: And next will be Rivka Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley.
RivkaGoldwasser: Yes, Hi, good afternoon. Let's go back to kind of especially on Ontada, you talk, Brian about subcontractor relationship and sort of that cycle between providers and biopharma, et cetera. So for Ontada, our payers customers as well and is that sort of coincided and started that sort of a growth opportunity that you're looking, just guess I'm interested in CapEx opportunities to grow that oncology business beyond just the pipeline of drugs.
BrianTyler: Thank you, Ricky. I think there's lots of interest in data and insights and understanding patient and provider behavior as relates to these oncolytics. Our primary focus in Ontada is really to leverage the data and the working relationships and the scale of our physician relationships, to generate insights that help the development, the discovery, and ultimately the launch and adoption of oncology products. And likewise, to take the early lessons we get in the research and the development and launch planning around these products to ensure that providers are most able to react, adopt and get great patient outcomes from that. So we see it as a very virtuous cycle really anchored in provider and in the biopharma companies. But there may be several other interested parties in the data insights that we can generate. And that's something that certainly consider as the business matures.
Operator: Next question will come from Jailendra Singh of Credit Suisse.
UnidentifiedAnalyst: Hi, this is Adam on for Jailendra today, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow up on the assumption of a return to pre COVID utilization in the second half of your fiscal year. One of your competitors this morning, thinking that they saw returns pre COVID prescription utilization in the June quarter. So I mean is the difference in comments as a function of customer or channel mix? Or I guess the way pre COVID is being measured? Or what else should we be thinking about when attempting to bridge those comments? Thanks.
BrittVitalone: Thank you for your question. I'll give you one example in a medical business as an example. What we saw in the June quarter was that primary care patient visits improved from the fourth quarter, back to about 95% in pre COVID level. So continuing to see the improvement but not back at pre COVID level. So when we speak about utilization, we are seeing pre COVID levels for oncology and for specialty. We're not seeing that quite yet for primary care patient visits as an example, continuing to improve on the trajectory that we laid out in our earnings call that we had expected. But that's one example, for our business that is perhaps a little bit different.
Brian Tyler: Great. Well, thank you, everyone. Thank you for your insightful questions. Thank you for joining us on this call. And thank you, Jenny, for helping facilitate the call. McKesson is off to a very strong start in our fiscal 2022. I'm incredibly excited, not just about the recovery of the market, but frankly, the execution by our teams, which is generating this performance in the business. So I want to be sure to thank our more than 75,000 employees for their commitment to be together to be a team to focus on doing good for our company, for our customers and for the healthcare industry. As a global leader in health care, we are committed to doing our part to serve our employees, our customers, our partners and our communities as they continue the pandemic response efforts. So, in closing, I just want to wish you all and your families, good health and wellness. Have a great evening, thank you. 
Operator: And thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

===== 2021 Q4  (2021-05-06 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the McKesson Q4 Earnings Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to you, Holly Weiss. Please go ahead.
Holly Weiss: Thank you, Stephanie. Good afternoon and welcome everyone to McKesson’s fourth quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. Today, I am joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today’s discussion will include forward-looking statements, such as forecasts about McKesson’s operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today’s press release and our slide presentation and to the Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Additional information about our non-GAAP financial measures including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results, is included in today’s press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website at investor.mckesson.com. With that, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Holly and good afternoon everybody. Thank you for joining us on our call this afternoon. On our fourth quarter call last year, I talked about how the COVID-19 pandemic was beginning to impact our employees, our customers, our partners and the very communities in which we live. As one of the largest health care companies in the world, I said that McKesson would play an essential role in protecting the health and safety of the healthcare supply chain. While we were confident in our abilities to help our customers during challenging times, what played out over the course of the year proved to be more unpredictable than anyone could have imagined. The up and down trajectory of the recovery was certainly different than we had originally anticipated. And our role in the COVID-19 response efforts evolved and expanded quickly as a result. Fiscal 2021 was one of the most challenging yet fulfilling and inspiring years of my career, a year like no other in the 188-year history of our company. I want to thank the team McKesson and our innumerable public and private partners for their resilience, commitment to our values and service to our caregivers and patients. From the onset of the pandemic, our sourcing teams worked closely with manufacturers and various government entities to better forecast changing pharmaceutical and medical product demand in order to extend supply and channel inventory to critical areas of need, whether it was working to secure higher volumes of PPE for caregivers and frontline workers early in the pandemic or leveraging our expertise and lab capabilities to ramp up distribution of COVID-19 tests as they came to market, McKesson moved quickly to support our customers, our partners and our communities. Our role in the COVID-19 response was also highlighted by our partnership with the U.S. government’s COVID-19 vaccine distribution effort, having been selected as the centralized distributor of refrigerated and frozen COVID-19 vaccines and the ancillary kits used to administer those COVID-19 vaccines. We distributed our first COVID-19 vaccine in December, shortly after Moderna’s vaccine was granted Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA. On February 27, Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine became the third COVID-19 vaccine granted EUA by the FDA and the second vaccine within the scope of our contract with the CDC. We began distributing the J&J vaccine within 48 hours of its authorization and we are now distributing out of all 4 fit-for-purpose distribution centers we built for this program. We stand ready to support the distribution of additional vaccines as they come to market. Through April, we have successfully distributed over 150 million Moderna and J&J COVID-19 vaccines to administration sites in the U.S., and we remain on target with the U.S. government’s distribution schedule. Also through April, we have assembled enough kits to support the administration of more than 550 million doses for all vaccine types. This work remains our company’s top priority, and we are prepared to support the U.S. government for as long as they ask us to lead the centralized distribution model. In Europe and Canada, we are also partnering with the local governments in the COVID-19 vaccine effort through administration in our owned and banner pharmacies as well as distribution efforts in selected markets and countries. Let me turn now to our financial performance. Against the dynamic and challenging macroeconomic backdrop in fiscal 2021, we grew revenues 3% and our adjusted earnings per diluted share result of $17.21, was up 15% over prior year. When pressed with challenges and uncertainties, our customers and government partners continued to choose McKesson to help ensure stability of supply for their patients. So while prescription volume and primary care patient visit trends negatively impacted the core business throughout the fiscal year, the strength of our business model and our differentiated capabilities help us to grow the business and deliver value to our shareholders. Our commitment to executing our strategy, transforming and simplifying the operating model contributed to these strong financial results. Looking forward into fiscal 2022, I am confident that we operate in scaled and resilient markets with underlying trends that support long-term growth. We invest in our business to differentiate our solutions and create value for customers, patients and partners. The pandemic has not paused our progress on these strategic priorities. Targeted investments into our business over time have positioned us well to succeed and respond quickly to changing demands from our customers and government partners during these uncertain times. We have been focused on building out a connected ecosystem over the last several years in the areas of oncology and biopharma services. These are areas where we believe we have key differentiated capabilities. Through investments in technology, we’ve been able to develop more robust solutions that help connect patients, providers and manufacturers and support our growth. Starting first with our oncology assets, which have proven to be resilient throughout the pandemic, through scaled distribution, GPO services in our U.S. oncology business were positioned well as innovative therapies come to market. Biosimilars are just one example where McKesson has been able to combine the breadth and scale of our specialty capabilities to help give providers choice and lower cost for patients. We were pleased to add more practices and over 100 providers to the U.S. Oncology Network in fiscal 2021. Today, through U.S. Oncology and our nonaffiliated provider business, we are connected to over 10,000 specialty physicians. And our oncology technology platform has supported millions of patient journeys, providing us access to real-world outcomes data and research. Our recently launched technology and real-world insights business, which we call, Ontada, is an extension of our oncology ecosystem and is a key area of investment for us, going forward. We believe this business differentiates our value proposition to providers looking to drive better outcomes for their patients and to manufacturers focused on innovative therapies in the area of oncology. In terms of biopharma services, in fiscal 2021, we brought together our RelayHealth Pharmacy, CoverMyMeds and RxCrossroads businesses. Together, these businesses are focused on innovating and automating the ways in which biopharma connects with patients, pharmacies and providers with the ultimate goal of providing stronger access, affordability and better adherence outcomes. These assets embed us in the daily workflows of over 50,000 pharmacies and more than 750,000 providers. We are integrated into over 75% of EHRs today. And through our market-leading position and advanced solutions, we’re able to automate and simplify otherwise very manual processes. Ultimately, our solutions help patients get on therapies quicker and stay on those therapies longer. This value proposition to our manufacturing partners is reflected by the over 500 brands we support today, covering nearly every therapeutic area. In fiscal 2022, we will remain focused on these growth areas and we will continue to look for ways to streamline the business so that we can operate with added speed and increased focus. Part of our commitment to grow the business is to continually review and evaluate our portfolio. Sometimes we find assets we’re not the natural owner of, as was the case with our German wholesale business, where we created a JV with Walgreens Boots Alliance in November. To further simplify the business, we continually evaluate and adapt the way in which we work. For McKesson, it’s been over a year since we successfully transitioned all of our office-based employees to work from home seemingly overnight and without a loss of productivity. While we are quite anxious to see each other in person soon and at a time and place where it’s appropriate and safe to do so, the success of our employees in this remote work environment and their desire for more work flexibility has challenged us to reevaluate the way we work and our real estate and existing office-based footprint. This is yet another example of how we’re looking to simplify operations and grow the business and do the right thing for our teams. Britt will go into more detail about our thinking on these impacts going forward. Now, let me turn to the business and touch on how we are positioned for success heading into fiscal 2022. I’ll start with U.S. Pharmaceutical, where we again grew adjusted operating profit despite soft prescription volume trends throughout the fiscal year. Our priority in this business is to strengthen the core and deliver the world’s highest-quality supply chain to our customers and manufacturing partners. Our focus on cost and working capital efficiencies underpin this growth and help fuel investments for growth across the business. For Generics, the pricing environment continues to track in line with our expectation. On the buy side, we leverage our scale and our sourcing capabilities through ClarusONE to ensure stability of supply at low cost for our customers. On the sell side, McKesson has taken a disciplined approach to pricing, and the market continues to be competitive but has been stable for years. While generic volume remained below pre-COVID levels in the quarter, we expect volume improvement over the course of our fiscal year. I am also pleased with the performance of our Specialty business this past year. Our U.S. Oncology business, patient visits were at pre-COVID baselines in March, with many returning for in-person visits to their providers. In fiscal 2022, we’ll look to grow both our U.S. Oncology and nonaffiliated businesses, which are just another part of our connected oncology ecosystem at McKesson. Let me talk about Prescription Technology Solutions. They perform well this year despite prescription volumes being down since the onset of the pandemic. We’re continuing to invest in innovation in this business, and despite this year’s challenges, we’ve been very successful in adding new brands to our platforms. In fiscal 2021, our access solutions helped over 50 million patients get on therapies after their original prescription was denied coverage. And our affordability solutions helped patients save over $7 billion in out of pocket prescription cost. Under a single cohesive go-to-market strategy, this segment is positioned to return to growth in fiscal 2022 as patient mobility improves and prescription trends recover. In fiscal 2021, Medical-Surgical played a central role in providing supplies to our primary and extended care customers at a critical time of need. Demand within this segment was volatile throughout the fiscal year for products such as PP&E and COVID-19 tests, and our procurement teams worked diligently to find the supplies our customers needed to treat their patients at a time when supply was constrained and pricing was volatile. While we took measures to meet the needs of our customers for PPE-related products, demand has fluctuated and market dynamics for some of these products has changed since the onset of the pandemic. As a result, we took action to position the business for lower demand levels, which resulted in inventory charges on some PP&E and related products. Further adapting to the impact of COVID-19 on our customers, we leveraged our existing lab capabilities to quickly distribute over 50 million COVID-19 tests into the provider settings we serve, demonstrating the breadth and expertise we have in our market-leading lab business. Despite patient mobility trends below pre-COVID levels for much of fiscal 2021, I’m proud of the way the business responded to the needs of our customers, and I am confident that as patients return to consume healthcare and see their community-based providers, our core business is positioned well for growth heading into fiscal 2022. Finally, turning to international, the segment grew full year adjusted operating profit despite lower foot traffic in many of our retail pharmacies across Europe and Canada, where the pandemic still lags the recovery we’re seeing in the U.S. Over the past several years, we’ve taken deliberate actions to address our cost structure and to evolve our retail footprint in these markets, and we saw benefits from those actions this fiscal year. We are also very disciplined in how we operate these businesses as evidenced by our thoughtful exit of unprofitable customers at the onset of the fiscal year in our Canadian business. These businesses play an important role in the pandemic response in their respective markets. And through our investments into digital assets, we’re able to better reach patients who are increasingly choosing electronic means to access healthcare in those countries. Going forward, we will continue to find ways to position these businesses for future growth. The pandemic still presents many unknowns, and the trajectory of the recovery will likely show signs of nonlinearity at times in our fiscal 2022. But we do expect a return to pre-COVID levels of prescription volumes and patient engagement levels in the second half of fiscal 2022. As utilization improves over the course of our fiscal year, we expect the stable fundamentals underlying our core business to serve as the foundation for the outlook we are providing you today. Our fiscal 2022 outlook of $18.85 to $19.45 of adjusted earnings per diluted share includes a return to solid growth in our core businesses, a continuation of our role in the COVID-19 vaccine efforts, investments in growth and a balanced approach to capital deployment. Britt will take you through additional detailed assumptions that make up this outlook. As I reflect back, fiscal 2021 has taught us a lot and it showed us once again that our business model is positioned well to adapt and succeed in uncertain times. Time and time again, we’ve proven our resiliency during crisis, and I’m so proud of the way our employees rose to the challenges brought on by the pandemic and society more broadly. Our ability to be together, to stand together, focused on our values and purpose in service of the healthcare communities we serve makes me so proud. We will focus on building momentum on our fiscal 2021 accomplishments, and we will look to embrace the changes that have made us better to advance our growth strategy and grow the business. We will also continue to be front and center in the fight against COVID-19, helping to serve the communities in which we live and work. I thank you again for your time. And I will turn it over to Britt.
Britt Vitalone: Thank you, Brian and good afternoon everyone. Fiscal 2021 was an unprecedented year, as Brian talked about earlier. When we spoke a year ago, we just finished our fiscal 2020 as the COVID pandemic was beginning to take hold on our communities and economies. During that call, we provided our full year fiscal 2021 outlook with quite possibly the highest level of uncertainty in McKesson’s 188-year history. As I have said since the outset of the pandemic, McKesson’s operating momentum is the result of our strategic clarity, focus, execution and discipline. As a company, we’ve been operating in new ways for over a year. We’re proud of the way our teams continue to execute and innovate. We are stronger than before the pandemic. And our fiscal 2021 financial results give us even more confidence in our ability to continue delivering compelling performance in the future. Today, I’ll provide an update on our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results, including a detailed fiscal 2022 outlook, an overview which can be found in the Investors section of our website. We start now with our fiscal 2021 results. Our full year adjusted earnings per diluted share of $17.21 grew 15% above fiscal 2020 and within our updated guidance range. Our fiscal year began with each of our segments experiencing volume decline due to the impact of COVID-19. Volume improvements in our first quarter were earlier than originally anticipated and on a nonlinear trajectory followed to the remainder of the fiscal year, correlating to the trajectory of the COVID virus. Our fiscal fourth quarter experienced a continuation of the volatility from COVID as well as a weak cold and flu season and a winter storm that impacted portions of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. We also recognized benefits from our leadership role distributing COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supply kits in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical segments, respectively. And similar to previous two quarters, in the fourth quarter, we recognized unplanned gains on equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio. Let me move now to a discussion of our adjusted earnings results for the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $5.05, an increase of 18% compared to the prior year, driven by the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution and kitting programs of the U.S. government and the lower share count. These items were partially offset by a higher tax rate in the prior year contribution from the company’s investment in Change Healthcare. Let’s transition now to details of our consolidated results, which can be found on Slide 4. Consolidated revenues of $59.1 billion increased 1% compared to the prior year primarily due to market growth and higher volumes from retail national account customers in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, partially offset by the prior year increase in demand driven by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the contribution of our German wholesale business through a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. Adjusted gross profit was approximately flat to prior year as inventory charges in our Medical-Surgical segment and the previously mentioned prior year demand increase, driven by COVID, largely offset the contribution of our COVID-19 vaccine distribution and kitting programs and the distribution of COVID-19 tests. Adjusted operating expenses in the quarter decreased 6% year-over-year, led by a reduction in operating expenses due to the impact of COVID-19 and the contribution of our German wholesale business to the joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. This was partially offset by increased expenses related to our role distributing COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supply kits and higher operating expenses to support growth investments in oncology and biopharma services. Adjusted operating profit was $1.2 billion for the quarter, an increase of 12% compared to the prior year. When excluding the $55 million contributed by Change Healthcare in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, which was previously recorded in other, adjusted operating profit grew 19%. Interest expense was $52 million in the quarter, a decline of 20% compared to the prior year, driven by the retirement of approximately $1 billion of debt and lower commercial paper balances. Our adjusted tax rate was 22.9% for the quarter, in line with our expectations. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share also includes net pretax gains of approximately $44 million or $0.21 per diluted share associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments. In wrapping up our consolidated results, fourth quarter diluted weighted average shares were 161 million, a decrease of 8% year-over-year, driven by the successful tax-free exit of our investment in Change Healthcare at the end of fiscal 2020 and other open-market share repurchase activity. As a reminder, the exit of our Change Healthcare investment lowered our shares outstanding by approximately 15.4 million shares. Moving now to our fourth quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 5 through 9, starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Revenues were $47 billion, an increase of 3%, driven by market growth and higher volumes from retail national account customers, partially offset by the prior year increase in demand driven by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and branded-to-generic conversions. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased 7% to $813 million, driven by the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution, partially offset by the previously mentioned prior year COVID pandemic impact and higher operating costs in support of the company’s oncology growth initiatives and the impact of a weak cold and flu season. Adjusted operating profit for the full year increased 3% to $2.7 billion, driven by growth in specialty product distribution the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution, offset by the previously mentioned prior year increase in demand driven by the onset of the pandemic and by higher operating costs in support of the company’s oncology growth initiatives. Next on to Prescription Technology Solutions, revenues in the quarter were $789 million, an increase of 7%, driven by higher volumes of technology and service offerings to support biopharma customers. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased 11% to $146 million, driven by organic growth from access and adherence programs supported by our Technology Solutions. Full year adjusted operating profit was $467 million, which was flat to the prior year, as organic growth from access and adherence solutions was offset by higher investment costs to support the growth of the company’s biopharma strategy. We finished the year with strong momentum from these investments, including our new product, AMP, which contributed to profit growth in the fourth quarter. Moving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions, revenues were $2.7 billion in the quarter, up 23%, primarily driven by demand for COVID-19 tests. For the quarter, adjusted operating profit increased 13% to $192 million and for the full year increased 19% to $805 million. We previously outlined that demand for COVID test kit and PPE products were closely associated with the rate of COVID case levels. Although COVID-19 test kit volume continued through the fourth quarter, these levels moderated significantly from Q3 levels as U.S. COVID cases trended lower throughout the quarter. As we discussed at various conferences during our fourth quarter, we anticipated that these elevated levels of demand would moderate. As we discussed in prior calls this year, early on in the pandemic, our Medical-Surgical business built supply quickly to meet demands from our customers for COVID-19 tests and elevated levels of demand for PPE. We procured these products in a market with unprecedented and unpredictable supply and demand levels, and the volatility associated with COVID case levels impacted the demand levels for PPE. The demand tapering occurred sooner than we had anticipated, and we took action to position the business for the lower demand levels. As a result, some PPE and related products experienced market-driven inventory charges. In our fourth quarter, we recorded $87 million of charges related to these products. Our underlying business was impacted by lower levels of elective procedures and patient visits, partially resulting from a continuation of a weaker cold and flu season. According to IQVIA, elective procedures trended approximately 20% below the prior year at times during the quarter. Excluding the impact of the incremental COVID-19 tests, PPE and distribution of ancillary supply kits for COVID-19 vaccine, adjusted operating profit in this segment increased approximately 1% in the quarter. Next, international, where revenues in the quarter were $8.6 billion, a decrease of 12% year-over-year, on an FX-adjusted basis, revenues decreased 18%, primarily driven by the contribution of our German wholesale business to a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance effective November 1, 2020. Similar to the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, the International segment was also impacted by the prior year increase in volumes, which corresponded with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding the impact from the divestiture of our German wholesale business, segment revenue increased 4% year-over-year and was down 4% on an FX-adjusted basis. Fourth quarter adjusted operating profit increased 1% year-over-year to $138 million. On an FX-adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit decreased 8% to $126 million due to the previously mentioned fiscal 2020 volume increase, again driven by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Adjusted operating profit for the full year increased 5% to $485 million. And on an FX adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit increased 1% to $466 million. Moving on to corporate, for the quarter, adjusted corporate expenses were $125 million, a decrease of 42% year-over-year driven by gains of approximately $44 million on equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio and prior year onetime expenses. For the full year, adjusted corporate expenses were $584 million, a decrease of 9% compared to the prior year, driven by gains of approximately $133 million or $0.60 of adjusted earnings per diluted share on equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio, partially offset by lower interest income. As in the previous two quarters, net fair value adjustments related to several of our portfolio companies within McKesson Ventures. As we previously discussed, we can’t predict when gains or losses within our Ventures portfolio of companies may occur. And therefore, our practice has and will continue to not include Ventures portfolio impacts in our earnings guidance. We reported opioid-related litigation expenses of $153 million for fiscal 2021. Until a settlement is reached and executed, we anticipate a similar level of spend. For fiscal 2022, we estimate opioid-related litigation to approximate $155 million. And finally, fiscal 2021 also marked the end of our previously announced 3-year program to transform our operating model and drive cost reductions across the enterprise. We are proud to have achieved our original 3-year target of $400 million to $500 million in savings by the end of fiscal 2021. A portion of the savings has been reinvested in our growth areas of oncology and biopharma services. Turning now to Slide 11, we continue to place a sharp focus on working capital efficiency and cash flow generation. For fiscal 2021, we generated free cash flow of $3.9 billion, and we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $6.3 billion, ahead of our expectations. In fiscal 2021, we continued our long track record of solid cash flow generation, resulting from another year of operating profit growth and our continued focus on working capital efficiency. In fiscal 2021, our cash flow was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including uneven levels of customer demand. Over the course of the year, the dynamics of the operating environment resulting from the early effects of COVID-19 introduced further volatility in our cash flow. We experienced higher levels of inventory primarily resulting from the increased quantities of COVID testing and PPE. We anticipated this additional working capital volatility, meeting the evolving needs of our customers, all while we’re increasing our work with the U.S. government to distribute COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supply kits. In Q3, we utilized a portion of our free cash flow to retire approximately $1 billion of debt, and we issued a $500 million bond at attractive market rates. These actions which were in line with our stated intent to modestly de-lever further strengthen our balance sheet and financial position. In fiscal 2021, we made $641 million of capital expenditures, which includes continued investments in our strategic growth initiatives of oncology and biopharma services as well as investments to support our COVID-19 vaccine and kitting efforts. We returned $1 billion of cash to our shareholders through $770 million of share repurchases and a payment of $276 million in dividends. Let me now spend a few minutes on our fiscal 2022 outlook. And I’ll start by framing a couple of key macro-level assumptions that underpin our outlook for fiscal 2022. We do not assume a return wave of the virus, additional shelter-in-place or increased social distancing. As we’ve discussed throughout the year, volume trends in fiscal 2021 were nonlinear and varied over the course of the year. Our markets have not fully recovered, and we remain in a dynamic environment. We are, however, encouraged by recent signs that a broader recovery is forthcoming. We expect prescription volumes will continue to demonstrate steady improvement from volume levels at the end of our fiscal 2021 through the first half of our fiscal 2022, in line with the rate of increasing vaccinations and decreasing COVID cases. We anticipate a return to pre-COVID prescription and patient engagement levels in the second half of our fiscal 2022. For fiscal 2022, we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $18.85 to $19.45, more heavily weighted towards the back half of the fiscal year. We also expect core growth across all of our segments. Rather than outlining each assumption, I will instead walk you through the key items, starting with the segments. For a full list of our fiscal 2022 assumptions, please refer to Slides 13 through 16 in our supplemental slide presentation. In the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, we expect revenue to increase 4% to 7% driven by market growth and strong performance in our specialty business. Adjusted operating profit is expected to deliver 4% to 7% growth as volumes continue to improve compared to fiscal 2021. Our outlook also includes approximately $0.40 to $0.50 related to COVID-19 vaccine distribution in fiscal 2022, the majority expected to be realized in our first quarter. This compares with approximately $0.35 in fiscal 2021. We will also continue to invest in our leading and differentiated position in oncology and increase investments to support future growth. We expect these investments will represent an approximate $0.20 headwind in fiscal 2022. Normalizing for the COVID-19 vaccine distribution and our continued growth investments, we expect approximately 5% to 8% core adjusted operating profit growth. Finally, we anticipate branded pharmaceutical pricing to approximate mid-single-digit increases, which is consistent with fiscal 2021. And the generic market remains competitive yet stable. We continue to be pleased with the performance of ClarusONE, which provides competitive costs and supply stability to our customers. This combined with our disciplined approach to pricing and improving overall volume and utilization, gives us confidence in our ability to grow and generate positive spread. In our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we expect revenue and adjusted operating profit growth of 12% to 17% driven by organic growth as we continue to recognize the benefits of the investments we’ve been making in technology offerings for our biopharma customers. Now, transitioning to Medical-Surgical fiscal 2021 saw notable impacts from the contribution of COVID test kits and personal protective equipment as well as impacts to the underlying business due to office closures, social distancing and reduced patient visits. Our Medical-Surgical business delivered strong results against these challenges, and we continue to position the business for long-term growth. In fiscal 2022, we expect demand for COVID test kits and PPE to moderate further as vaccinations increase and case counts decrease. As patients continue to return to their providers, we expect growth in our Primary and Extended Care segments of this business. Given these dynamics, we expect revenue to be down 5% to 1% growth, and we expect adjusted operating profit to be flat to 6% growth over the prior year as growth in our underlying business is offset by a lower contribution from COVID test kits. Included in this guidance is $0.10 to $0.20 of contribution related to the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines. Again, the majority will be realized in our first quarter. This compares to approximately $0.35 in fiscal 2021. Due to the timing of when we began executing our contract with HHS, a larger portion of kitting revenue was realized in fiscal 2021. Excluding the contribution of our COVID-19 kitting and distribution program, the contribution from COVID-19 test kits and the fiscal 2021 impairments for PPE and related products, we expect year-over-year adjusted operating profit growth of approximately 10% to 16%. Finally, in the international segment, we expect revenues to decline 2% to grow 3% as compared to the prior year, and this reflects the contribution of our German wholesale business to a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance in the third quarter of our fiscal 2021. We expect adjusted operating profit growth in the segment of 4% to 8%, led by core business improvement as our geographies continue the recovery from COVID-19. And now turning to the consolidated view, we expect 3% to 6% revenue and adjusted operating profit growth compared to fiscal 2021. We expect corporate expenses to be $670 million to $720 million. And as a reminder, our corporate expenses in fiscal 2021 were offset by net gains of approximately $133 million or $0.60 per diluted share from equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio. We assume a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 18% to 19%, which may vary from quarter to quarter and includes anticipated discrete tax items that we expect to realize during the course of the year. As Brian mentioned in his remarks, we continue to transform and evolve our operating models to drive efficiencies. As part of this evolution, we plan to make changes to our real estate strategy to increase efficiencies, supporting increased flexibility, including a transition to a partial remote work model for certain employees on a go-forward basis. This will result in reduction to our real estate footprint. In executing this plan, we will incur GAAP-only restructuring charges of approximately $180 million to $280 million over the next year. We expect these actions will result in the realization of annual savings of approximately $60 million to $80 million when fully implemented. These actions will get underway in this upcoming fiscal year, and therefore, we do not expect to see a material benefit in fiscal 2022. We are in the early stages of this planning and we will provide additional detail at a later time. Let me wrap up our fiscal 2022 outlook with a few comments on cash flow and capital deployment. The past year has reinforced the importance of managing our business for the long term through a disciplined and balanced approach to capital deployment with a sharp focus on investments for innovation and growth to further enhance our competitive positioning and leverage our differentiated assets and capabilities. We expect free cash flow of approximately $3.5 billion to $3.9 billion, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses. As we consider our capital deployment options, we first start with our commitment to maintain our current investment-grade credit rating. With respect to capital deployment, our priority is growth and the use of capital continues to be focused on supporting organic growth of our oncology and biopharma services strategies, followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions to accelerate these strategies. We complement these growth drivers with the return of capital to our shareholders through a modest share-growing dividend and share repurchases. We continue to execute at a high level, and we have confidence in the business today and in the future. And we continue to believe that there’s great value in our stock. As indicated on Slide 16, our fiscal 2022 outlook incorporates plans to repurchase approximately $2 billion of stock, which we expect will be more heavily weighted to the first half of the fiscal year. As a result of this activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2022 to be in the range of approximately 153.5 million to 155.5 million. We also anticipate use of cash to purchase shares in McKesson Europe through exercises of a put rate option available to non-controlling shareholders. As a reminder, McKesson originally acquired 77% of Celesio, the remaining non-controlling interest shareholders retained a put option for their shares. The put right option of the minority stakeholders expires in Q1 of fiscal 2022. We estimate that the remaining put rate options could result in cash payments up to approximately $1.3 billion, which will be reflected in the financing activities section of our cash flow statement. During fiscal 2021, McKesson used $49 million of cash for exercise of these put rate options. In fiscal 2021, we delivered strong performance in an unprecedented environment, and we capped off our 3-year operating model transformation, setting the stage for an acceleration of growth. We look forward to continuing our role in the pandemic response by distributing COVID-19 vaccine and ancillary supply kits as we continue our leadership role in the pandemic response. Our outlook for fiscal 2022 reflects the continued confidence in our operating momentum with growth across all segments of the business, supported by the strength of our balance sheet and strong financial position. We will continue to invest in our strategies of oncology and biopharma services as we build out our connected ecosystems in these growth areas, delivering value to our customers and partners. We’re confident in our ability to leverage our position and capabilities to accelerate growth. In closing, I would like to acknowledge and thank all the McKesson associates across the world for their dedication, execution and unrelenting commitment to our customers and patients. The results we achieved this year could not have been possible if not for the dedication of team McKesson. We are pleased with our results in fiscal 2021 and confident in our outlook for fiscal 2022. And with that, Holly, let me turn the call back to you for Q&A.
Holly Weiss: Thank you, Britt. I will now turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa Gill: Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Brian and Britt, I just really want to start with the oncology business. So Britt, I want to better understand the $0.20 of investment that you talked about in the guidance and help me to understand what type of investments you’re making there. Are they tuck-in acquisitions? Is it technology, those kinds of things? And then secondly, as we think about growth in the oncology and specialty business, can you maybe just talk about the impact of biosimilars, what you’ve seen in the quarter and kind of your expectations going into 2022?
Britt Vitalone: Good afternoon, Lisa. Thanks for that question. Let me just talk a little bit about the mechanics and then Brian can talk a little bit about some of the specific investments that we are making. We did talk on our Q3 call about the second half having investments in our oncology business and how that would be a modest headwind to the second half of the year. And we did make those investments. We’re increasing our investments next year. We’ve talked about our Ontada business publicly now, and we’re making some good traction and having some good partnerships that we’re – that we have been announcing. And so we are going to continue to invest in our oncology ecosystem in FY ‘22. It’s another investment year, but we do see that we are going to be turning profitability in years after. We feel very confident that these investments in the oncology business and specifically in Ontada will bear fruit. Now, Brian, maybe you talk about the specific investments?
Brian Tyler: Yes. I think that’s right, Britt. I mean I’d put – I think of the investments in a couple of buckets, right. We have got a leading EMR in oncology. Well, we need to continue to invest in that as the practice of oncology changes and the complexity of the therapies continue to evolve and things like genomics and all these advanced diagnostics start to fold in. That’s a bit of just infrastructure investment. Britt talked about Ontada, that’s our technology and data insights business that we are investing in. That’s a growth – future growth area of opportunity for us. And then we did not have any M&A in oncology in this quarter. We have had some great partnerships. We had some great momentum on that front. This is an area that is strategically – is aligned to our enterprise strategy and we would certainly be open to doing M&A if it was on strategy and met our financial thresholds for good M&A.
Britt Vitalone: And Lisa, maybe I’ll just finish up on your biosimilars question. We are very pleased with how biosimilars are beginning to hit the market. We see the pipeline growing, particularly in the oncology space. It’s not a material driver to our results right now, but we are encouraged by the pipeline and we are encouraged by the opportunities in the next – in the coming years. So, we think that biosimilars are going to continue to be a positive driver for the business, for the providers and for patients and we expect with our scale and reach that we will continue to get that contribution as adoption continues to increase.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Jones: Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess just on the guidance within the Pharma segment, the core growth of 5% to 8%, Britt, seems really strong, especially considering your assumption that scripts won’t be back to pre-COVID level into the second half. So, just any additional kind of building blocks or thoughts there would be helpful? And then just to clarify, your peers have talked a lot about pockets of pricing pressure in generics and pockets of volume weakness. Just want to understand clearly what your assumptions are from what you are seeing today and in guidance relative to the generic book?
Britt Vitalone: Thanks for the question, Bob. Look, we are very pleased with how the business has continued to grow and gain momentum. This is the second year in a row now where this business has grown. We have got really good scale and reach across all of our businesses. Brian talked about our specialty businesses and particularly the differentiation that we have in oncology. And so we think that the momentum is going to continue. As I mentioned in my remarks, we’re seeing some encouraging signs, and we think that as utilization comes back, the momentum will just continue. As it relates to our thought on the pricing environment, again, from a branded pricing perspective, we expect that FY ‘22 will look a lot like FY ‘21. And from a generic perspective, we have a great sourcing capability in ClarusONE. We continue to do a great job for our customers in providing stability of supply and low cost. We don’t see anything that’s really changed the dynamics around either the buy side or the sell side. It’s a competitive market but it’s been stable now for several quarters. And we feel with the strength of our sourcing operation and our disciplined approach on the sell side that we’ll continue to see the same types of contribution that we’ve seen now for several quarters.
Brian Tyler: Years, actually.
Britt Vitalone: Years, yes.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Cherny with Bank of America.
Mike Cherny: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe if we could talk a little bit about pharmacy tech solutions a bit. It doesn’t really get a ton of attention, but clearly, it’s become a big piece of the EBIT. As you think about the demand curve that you’ve seen heading into fiscal ‘22, and obviously, in terms of how pharmacies are reacting from fiscal ‘21 and all the changes they’ve had around COVID, can you just give us a sense on what drives that growth? It’s clearly stand out in terms of your overall revenue, overall profitability it’s higher margin. So how should we think about where the adoption levels are coming from your customers in terms of supporting that underlying growth?
Brian Tyler: Yes. I mean, thanks, great question. So fundamentally, this is a transaction volume-based business. So as script growth returns, that’s a good fundamental underlying driver of this business. We also grow this business by signing more brands onto our programs and to innovating and putting more value on our network that delivers value to a pharmacist, to a provider or to a biopharma that allows us to grow our services revenue. I mean, fundamentally, this is about growing transactions.
Britt Vitalone: I think just the other thing I would add there the way that we’re growing the transactions is we’re utilizing technology. We have great technology and capabilities within that business, and that allows us to leverage our capabilities in a unique way.
Brian Tylerb: Yes. So our access to workflow, our ability to automate, what we’re doing is creating new solutions that drive volume through – transaction volume through our networks by solving real customer problems.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Percher with Nephron Research.
Eric Percher: Thank you. Question on the medical side, the core growth of 10% to 16% is notable. I’d be interested to hear how the medical business has changed as you continue to progress through the COVID pandemic. And then how much or to what extent can you follow testing? Of course, it’s declining. It’s also moving toward retail and home. We saw the alignment with Cardinal. Where else or how material could that be to you?
Brian Tyler: I’ll start and give a few comments, Eric. Look, it was certainly a dynamic year in the medical business, I mean, out of the gates with PPE demand outstripping supply by a wide margin. You’re well familiar with the early period of this fiscal year. Mid-part of the year, we start to see COVID test kits really come to market. And through our leading position as a lab distributor, I think our team did a fantastic job working with really a broad spectrum of those providers across all types of tests, molecular, antigen, antibody, to get those into the provider communities that we serve. And we had tremendous growth. That growth probably peaked in Q3. It was, frankly – it fell away quicker than we had anticipated when we had our earnings call in that third quarter. We still – there is still COVID test kit volume out there. But it certainly was – if any – of all of our businesses, I would say the medical business was the most dynamic in terms of the market dynamics this year.
Britt Vitalone: And maybe, Eric, just to follow-up on that, as Brian talked about the breadth of our – the markets that we serve and the breadth of products and capabilities that we have, our leading capabilities go across Rx, private brand, lab, as Brian talked about. And if you go before the pandemic, FY ‘20, we had growth – AOP growth of about 12%. So I think as we look at our guide for next year, it really speaks to the fundamentals of the business have remained very strong all the way through the pandemic. And as volumes begin to come back and utilization comes back online, we would expect that the business could continue to grow in that historical range.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS.
Kevin Caliendo: Hi. Thanks for taking my call. So you guys have $6 billion of cash in your balance sheet. Looking at the cash flow from this year, even with the larger buyback and the dividend, like you’re still likely to add cash, net-net. There’s been a lot of talk about potentially what you might do in terms of M&A going forward. What’s your appetite in terms of M&A? Are you looking to just add on and bolt on? Is there a meaningful acquisition you’d be looking to do? Anything notable, sort of talk about where you sit now versus maybe where you had been in the past?
Brian Tyler: Yes. I mean let me give you just a couple of framing comments on how we think of M&A. So first, if it’s what we would call tuck-in or it’s a core business, we’re in the business today, we understand the business, it’s just about really adding customers or maybe a capability but – and scale to a platform we already have, that’s attractive M&A. And over the history of this company, we’ve been very successful doing that kind of M&A. The second kind that we – the second criteria we really have is to assess its alignment to our enterprise strategy. We’ve articulated our oncology ecosystem and our biopharma services business as areas that we want to deploy growth capital against. But it’s got to meet our third criteria, which is we’re very financially disciplined about the way we approach these things. We know we have alternate uses to deploy our capital. M&A is just one of them. And so we’re very disciplined as we think about approaching M&A. But I would say we would do M&A if it was aligned to our strategy, it fits that first type of M&A, a tuck-in, and it met our financial discipline business criteria.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company.
Charles Rhyee: Yes, thanks for taking the question. Wanted to ask about sort of the vaccine guidance – contribution guidance, the $0.40 to $0.50, should we assume that’s pretty much front-end weighted into the fiscal year? And have you taken into account some of the concerns around vaccine hesitancy and the fact that whether the pace of vaccine administration is going to slow down? Thanks.
Britt Vitalone: Thanks for the question. Let me address that. As I think I’ve mentioned in past calls, we take our guidance from the U.S. government. They make all the decisions on the administration of the program. And so we leverage the guidance that they gave us in terms of volumes and where those volumes need to be distributed. And that’s how we put this guide together. So that’s how we form the basis of the $0.40 to $0.50 for the vaccine distribution and the $0.10 to $0.20 for the kit distribution. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, that’s going to be weighted more towards the first half of the year or first quarter of the year primarily.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays.
Steven Valiquette: Thanks. Good afternoon. So Britt, in your prepared remarks, you called out the weak cold and flu season. That did have some impact on the fiscal 4Q results just reported. It seemed like that dynamic did cause a wide variation in financial impact across all three distributors. But I guess as we think about the fiscal ‘22 guidance from you guys, you mentioned the return to the pre-COVID levels of prescriptions and patient levels in the back half of the year. I just want to confirm whether or not that includes the normal cough, cold, flu season. Is that also a large factor or a small factor in that 5% to 8% core EBIT growth in U.S. pharma? Thanks. 
Britt Vitalone: Sure. Thanks for the question. Look, as I talked about, there were a couple of factors that really occurred during the fourth quarter. Weak cold and flu season was one of those. We also had a winter storm. Those had modest impacts on our results. We do expect next year that we would have a normal flu season. Those are very difficult to predict in the last several years. We’ve had some variations within what normal is based on history. But we expect that the cold and flu season will be back to a normal cadence historically. And as utilization starts to improve over our first half of the year and get back to pre-COVID levels in the second half of the year, that’s where we expect volumes will begin to ramp.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird.
Eric Coldwell: Thanks very much. This somewhat tails on Charles’ question. It was – in a nutshell, you guided to earnings being back half weighted again. And frankly, if I look at the 3 years prior to COVID, your contribution was, on average, 54% of full year earnings. So I just want to make sure that this is, more than anything, kind of a reiteration of what happened in the past prior to COVID impacts, number one. And then number two, if the heavy weighting of your vaccine and kitting, $0.50 to $0.70, is in the first quarter, how do we true that up with earnings being weighted towards the back half? Is by default is the implication that we should be a bit more cautious on 2Q results? Just trying to bridge all these moving pieces. Thanks.
Britt Vitalone: Yes. Sure. Let me see if I can help you out. You are correct. Historically, our earnings have been generated primarily heavier in the second half of the year. And we would expect that we would have a slightly higher second half contribution than the first half again this year. I think when you look at our guide and you look at the vaccine contribution of $0.40 to $0.50 on the range of $18.85 to $19.45, inside of that, the core business is still growing. And we would expect that as utilization continues to improve through the first half and gets back to pre-COVID in the second half, that those core earnings would reflect that. So again, I think, historically, we’ve had higher second half contribution than the first half. We expect that we’ll have a slightly higher second half than first half contribution as well. We don’t guide the quarter, so I’m really not going to comment on second quarter versus first quarter. I think you should take our thinking on how utilization comes back online.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser: Yes. Hi. Good evening. So my question goes back to the guidance of ‘22 for core distribution operating income growth. We get often questions from investors around what’s the long-term growth algorithm for the business. I think it’s really helpful that you separated the core. So when we think about that core growth of 5% to 8%, and while it doesn’t include some of the COVID impacts, it does include lower volumes in the first half of the year. Should we think about that as sort of the starting point or a baseline for longer term growth and when volumes accelerate that, that starting point could be even higher? And then my follow-up question is just on the opioids litigation. Your guidance assumes sort of the same legal expenses in 2022 and in 2021. So if we can get any updates on where you are in the process. Thank you.
Britt Vitalone: Thanks, Ricky, for the question. Let me see if I can start with your first question. Look, we have talked about improving momentum in our business for the last several quarters, and you referenced 5% to 8% core. That’s for our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. We expect that our business is going to continue to generate improving momentum over the course of FY ‘22. And so we feel very good that we’ve had a return to growth in that segment, really the whole business over the last 2 years that we would expect that, that will continue. We’ve talked about some of the investments that we are making in the business and how we’re leveraging some of those investments. And so I think what you should – you should not think about this as a long-term jumping off point. We don’t provide long-term guidance. And I would hesitate for you to just take that 5% to 8% and take it out over the long-term. But what you should take from this is we expect continuing improvement in utilization, continuing momentum in the business, and I think our core growth rate really reflects that. I don’t know, Brian, if you want to...
Brian Tyler: Yes. I mean also embedded in the U.S. Pharma segment is the assumption that the flu season returns to normal. That, historically, would have been in the run rate and not incremental growth for the segment. Relative to opioids, the second part of your question, Ricky. We continue to have constructive discussions around a broad settlement framework and structure. The parameters of that have been pretty consistent over the last several quarters. I’m very encouraged. We’re hopeful we can reach resolution. We think it will be great for patients and communities. But as we said last quarter, until we have a deal, we are going to continue to prepare to defend ourselves, and we’ve made significant investments in that defense. We’re prepared to rigorously and vigorously defend ourselves in court if it comes to that. So our assumption, until such point in time that we have a resolution, is that we’ll continue to make the ongoing investment in our defense.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.
George Hill: Hey good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you might be able to give me an answer to a question that would settle some debate in the investor community, which is, I guess, could you talk about your appetite for maybe adding another leg to the operational stool through M&A and kind of how we should think about the company’s appetite for deals that could be dilutive or value transference, if that’s the right word, in the short-term for – to enter segments that could relate to your core customers and might have a better long-term growth profile? So that’s kind of the really broad M&A question, but just interested in how you’re thinking about the – kind of the risk appetite versus valuation.
Brian Tyler: Well, look, first, we’re always looking at the landscape. And if you look at the landscape in health care this year, obviously, with the pandemic, we saw a lot of the telehealth assets really catch a lot of momentum. We’ve gone back. We’ve checked our strategies based on how we’ve seen the landscape change over the past year. And I’ll just say this, we have a lot of conviction that our strategy, which is built around continuing to get growth out of the core, continuing to focus on oncology and continuing to focus on biopharma services, where we think we have unique and distinguished capabilities, we have the opportunity to do internal innovation to drive growth, and we have appetite to do external growth if we can find the right asset, align to the strategy in the right way that meets our return thresholds.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jailendra Singh with Credit Suisse.
Jailendra Singh: Thank you. I actually want to talk – ask about your International segment. Maybe if you can provide some little bit more details on the key drivers behind 4% to 8% core growth you expect in that business in fiscal ‘22?
Brian Tyler: Sure. I’ll start. I mean let’s – first, we should recognize that in the International segment, the pandemic recovery is lagging what we’re seeing in the U.S. a little bit. But we’re very pleased with the performance that this business has had. We have worked diligently over the last few years to really think about how we organize and streamline and make that business more efficient, capturing some of the scale across all of the countries. We’ve been rigorous in looking at our retail footprint, and we’ve done some rationalization of our physical estate there. And we’ve made some investments, frankly, in some digital technologies that really were – turned out to be quite timely and important this year as patients decided they wanted to use digital health services more. So we are very pleased with the performance of the European business. We run it in a very disciplined, very tight way. It is not inherently high-growth markets. So to get the growth that we see, we’re very pleased with the team.
Britt Vitalone: And I guess I would just add. Similar to the U.S. market, our international markets have also faced COVID headwinds. And we would expect that those markets will begin to recover along the same type of time lines we laid out in our broader comments.
Holly Weiss: Operator, we have time for one more question.
Operator: Certainly, that question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, just in your prepared remarks, you talked about expanding U.S. Oncology. So just curious how you see that? Philosophically, is that – how will that play out? Is that expansion in terms of footprint, number of practices, capabilities? And how are you thinking about the shift of that business or evolution of that to value base as the oncology world changes?
Brian Tyler: Yes, great question. So look, we think we have a terrific value proposition for independent community-based oncologists. And we look to grow our practices and our – the number of oncologists in those practices. That is part of the growth, I mean, and we like that growth. But we also think we have the opportunity to grow our research efforts to grow our data and analytics and insight business. We’ve got opportunity to put more value into our EMR so that we stay contemporary with patient care and that we’re innovating ahead of the marketplace. And we view all of these things as kind of reinforcing each other, right? More scale in the network gives you a bigger distribution channel for the products and services that you develop, more impact back upstream to the biopharmas. And that’s why we’ve actually been referring to it as an ecosystem because these are not really disconnected growth strategies. They are actually quite connected under the umbrella of oncology.
Brian Tyler: Okay. Well, thank you everybody. That enters our fiscal 2022. I am excited about the businesses and the markets that we operate in today. I’m very pleased with our performance and the momentum that gives us, and I really do believe we are positioned for long-term success. I’m again so proud of how resilient our employees have been throughout the pandemic. And in fiscal 2022, we look forward to supporting our customers, partners and communities as we hopefully resolve these uncertain times. We wish you and your families good health and wellness. Get vaccinated. And I want to wish everybody a Happy Nurses Day. Thanks to all those amazing nurses out there on the front line. Thanks, everybody. Have a great evening.
Operator: Thank you for joining today’s conference call. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-02-02 08:00:00) =====
Operator:
Holly Weiss: Good morning and welcome everyone to McKesson's Third Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, such as forecast about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's press release and our slide presentation and to the Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Additional information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results, is included in today's press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website at investor.mckesson.com. With that, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Holly. And good morning, everybody. I appreciate you joining us on our call today. Before I get to our third quarter results, I'd like to update you on the status of discussions related to a framework proposed resolution of opioid-related claims. In the third quarter, we made an accrual of approximately $8.1 billion, reflecting the amount we would expect to pay over a period of 18-years for opioid-related claims of governmental entities, with more than 90% intended to remediate the opioid crisis. We continue to be in ongoing advanced discussions with State Attorneys General and counsel for plaintiffs and based on the substantial progress we have made toward a settlement, we determined it was appropriate to accrue for this liability. Although we're prepared to defend ourselves vigorously, we remain hopeful that a broad resolution can be achieved, which would accelerate relief efforts for the people and communities impacted by this public health crisis. Now, let's get to the results. We're pleased to report third quarter total company revenues of $62.6 billion and an adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.60, which is ahead of the prior year and the revised expectations we laid out in November. The third quarter was yet another example of the often unpredictable and dynamic nature of the recovery from the effects of the pandemic, while heightened demand persisted for products like COVID-19 tests and PPE, medical visits, and prescription volume trends did show some signs of softness in the quarter. Despite those macro trends, we're pleased to have grown adjusted operating profit across each of our segments. And our third quarter results reflect the important role McKesson plays in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the US and abroad. Our fundamentals remain strong, and we continue to see success across the differentiated assets in our broad portfolio. Today, we are raising and narrowing our fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance range to $16.95 to $17.25 per diluted share. This is up from our previous range of $16 to $16.50 per diluted share. This update reflects our solid performance in the quarter and improved outlook across the business, including the anticipated contribution from our work distributed - distributing COVID-19 vaccines and assembling and distributing ancillary supply kit. Before turning to the business, I do want to expand on the work being done across McKesson in support of the COVID-19 vaccination efforts in the US. In August of last year, the CDC selected McKesson to ramp up and distribute future COVID-19 vaccines in the US, expanding our 14-year partnership. The CDC exercises existing option within our vaccines for children contract, making McKesson the centralized distributor of COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies needed to administer vaccines, similar to the role we played in the H1N1 pandemic over 10 years ago. Our team immediately got to work, standing up the infrastructure needed the support and initiative of this scale, we quickly established new fit-for-purpose distribution centers, separate from our normal business operation, so that when vaccines became available for distribution, McKesson would be ready to execute our part. We've added four new distribution centers that are highly specialized and capable of frozen and refrigerated cold chain COVID-19 vaccine distribution, and given our work also includes the assembly and storage of ancillary supplies, several more DCs were brought online to support this additional work. In total, we've added over 3.3 million square feet of dedicated space to support this initiative. A little over a month ago, on December 18, Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine became the second COVID-19 vaccine granted emergency use authorization by the FDA and given this vaccine is within the scope of our contract with the CDC, McKesson began distributing the vaccine within 48 hours of its authorization. Through January, McKesson has successfully distributed over 25 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to sites around the country. From a distribution perspective, we remain on target to meet the US government's plan to distribute hundreds of millions of refrigerated and frozen vaccines. There are currently distributing vaccines from only two of the four DCs built for this program. I'd like to remind you that in this operation, McKesson is operating as a third-party logistics provider on behalf of the US government, which is similar to our role during H1N1. The US government administers this program allocating vaccines to states, pharmacy chains, federal agencies, et cetera and takes orders for the participating provider site. Ultimately, the US government makes all allocation decisions and decides what product is distributed to what site, and in what quantities. The orders are submitted to McKesson and when the orders are received, we pick pack and ship orders typically within one business day of receiving the order. We are using the depth and breadth of our experience to manage the safe distribution of hundreds of millions of doses of vaccines to the entire country. We believe this distribution approach is the safest and fastest way to get COVID-19 vaccines into the arms of Americans across our country. This is a complex distribution program with several partners, collaborating from end-to-end and McKesson takes extensive measures to maintain the safety and efficacy of the vaccine supply chain. Our goal is that every shipment be received at the administration site in a timely manner and within the specified guidelines established by the manufacturer. As I've discussed, our work as a centralized distributor is now underway. So earnings from the COVID-19 vaccine distribution program are factored into our improved outlook for fiscal 2021. McKesson has also been hard at work preparing and distributing the ancillary kits needed to administer all of the COVID 19 vaccines, including for the Pfizer ultra-frozen vaccine, even though Pfizer's vaccine itself is not distributed by McKesson. Each week we're producing enough kits to support 10 to 15 million doses and to date, we have assembled enough kits to support over 250 million doses. It's our great privilege to have been selected to serve the US government for these roles and we've been engaged with the new administration's transition team and stand ready to fulfill our commitments in the ongoing battle against COVID-19. Now let's get to the business. I'll summarize the third quarter and then turn it over to Britt to provide more details. Let me start with US Pharmaceutical. Prescription volume trends in the third quarter were again reflective of the non-linear trajectory of the recovery. After seeing stability in the market trends in the second quarter, we saw some volume declines in our third quarter as it progressed, driven in part by a light cold and flu season versus the prior year. Despite some softness in volume trends within the quarter, we continued to see stability in brand and generic pricing. Through the third quarter and into January, branded price inflation has tracked in line with our original expectation. For generics, we continued to be disciplined in our approach to pricing in the market. On the buy side, through the scale and strength of our sourcing operation with ClarusONE, we've leveraged our relationships with a diverse set of manufacturers to main - stable levels of supply at low cost for our customers throughout the pandemic. Strong pricing discipline and effective sourcing continue to allow us to earn spread in the business. While total prescription volume trends fluctuated in the quarter, specialty volumes and particularly oncology have been more resilient throughout the pandemic, our provider solutions and US Oncology businesses have performed well year-to-date and our key areas of investment as we look to further differentiate our capabilities in oncology. In the quarter, the US Oncology network continues to expand its reach in some local communities by welcoming two new practices, further strengthening the availability of advanced cancer care across the communities we serve. US Oncology also reached a major milestone in its journey to provide high-quality, value-based care by enrolling its 100,000th patient in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation Oncology Care Model. Lastly, our Health Mart franchises are expanding the role they play in the fight against the pandemic. Health Mart pharmacies have performed more than 400,000 COVID-19 test collections through a partnership with Equinor [ph] and the HHS. Many of our Health Mart franchise pharmacies are also preparing to serve as COVID-19 vaccine administration sites in local communities when the CDC moves into the next phase of the rollout. Let's transition to our international segment. Our businesses in Europe and Canada are continuing to play their part in the pandemic response and as essential business our pharmacies remain open. Through our owned and banner [ph] stores abroad we're working with local governments to accelerate COVID-19 testing efforts. Our digital offerings like Well.ca in Canada and Echo by LloydsPharmacy continue to grow quickly and expand their service offerings to meet the needs of patients. Also, as a reminder, on November 1st, we completed the creation of a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance, combining our German wholesale businesses. While it is still early days, we are excited about these teams coming together and the progress they are making. Let's turn to Medical. When we gave initial guidance for fiscal 2021, our alternate site customers were facing significant headwinds with providers and surgery centers seeing sharp declines in office visits due to shelter-in-place guidelines. These dynamics were clearly reflected in our first quarter results, which were significantly down versus prior year. The pandemic continues to affect the needs of our customers in this market and how they operate today, who looks very different than it did nine months ago. As our customers reopen and address COVID-19, the core business has recovered and returned to growth. Within one of the largest - with one of the largest and most tenured sales forces in the industry, our Primary and Extended Care teams work hard every day to ensure that our customers have the products and services they need to provide patient care, whether it's COVID-19 tests, PPE or pharmaceuticals. Investments we've made into our lab business over the last few years have given us additional expertise and reach around lab testing solutions. So as COVID testing emerged, we have been well-positioned to expand our existing partnerships and quickly drive these products into the community provider channels. We strategically built this business to succeed at moments like this. We are the leader in distribution to the alternate site setting and offer a broad set of products and solutions to over 250,000 customers. The broad capabilities of this business position us well to quickly take advantage of new opportunities as they emerge and as customer demand evolve. I continue to be impressed at how our Medical business has responded to the rapid change in fiscal 2021. Turning now to Prescription Technology Solutions. We saw solid growth in the quarter, underpinned by the expansion of our brand support programs for our biopharma partners. We invest in innovation in this segment, and our results reflect positive contributions from our prior authorization solutions and newer products, like Access for More Patients, also known as AMP. AMP service offering is continuing to be recognized in the market, both by our biopharma customers and the industry. AMP recently signed on a full product portfolio for a top pharmaceutical company and was recognized as one of 2020's most innovative products in the health care and medical category according to Best in the Biz Awards, an honor voted on by top reporters and editors in North America. Taking a step back to reflect, it was over two years ago that we redefined our strategy, identifying the areas of oncology and biopharma services as key differentiators and areas of investment. We also set out to make the business simpler and more efficient, kicking-off a comprehensive review of the company's operating and cost structure. Since then, we have been methodical in our actions, as we work to build a connected ecosystem of assets across the enterprise, with the ultimate goal of creating innovative solutions that improve patient care delivery and drive incremental profit growth for the company. Through internal investments and M&A, we've built a powerful and scaled specialty business with deep oncology expertise. Today, we are the number one distributor in community oncology. And the US oncology network is the nation's largest network of its kind, with 1,400 independent physicians. Most recently, we launched Ontada, an internally developed technology and insights business dedicated to transforming the fight against cancer. Ontada builds off our existing capabilities and combines real-world data and research with the leading suite of technologies to help deliver innovative solutions that improve patient outcomes. Shortly after the launch of Ontada, Amgen and McKesson announced a strategic agreement to advance cancer care and improve outcomes by accelerating the development and access to life-changing medicine. Last quarter, I talked about the evolution of our Prescription Technology Solutions assets into the exciting business it is today. This business is a powerful biopharma commercial services business that enables over $5 billion in annual prescription savings for patients through innovation and next-generation patient access and adherence solutions. The strategic investments I've discussed have been powered in part by the successful efforts to streamline the business. We've centralized many back office functions in North America and Europe and have become smarter as an organization about how we spend and invest. We also continued to evaluate the portfolio and position the business for success. Last year, we successfully exited our position in Change Healthcare and most recently, we created the joint venture in Germany with WBA. Further, we re-segmented the business to better align us around our strategies and increased focus and speed throughout the organization. But underpinning everything we do is our continued focus on growing the core business, where fundamentals continue to be stable and execution has improved. Success in the core enables strong cash flow generation, which we can use to reinvest back into the business and return to our shareholders. While the pandemic has brought an unprecedented level of uncertainty, it has not paused our strategic priorities and we will continue to invest to differentiate and innovate our service offerings to our customers. This has served us well throughout the pandemic as we responded to near term demands from our customers, but it also positions the business to succeed in the long-term. As we look forward to our fiscal 2022, I'd like to walk through some of the things we're thinking about. First and foremost, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to present many unknowns. The trajectory of the virus can change quickly, accelerating in some communities and decelerating in others. The recovery from the pandemic is likely to continue to be non-linear into fiscal 2022. But McKesson will continue to be part of the recovery, serving our customers and partners every step of the way. Secondly, our work distributing COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies will ultimately be influenced by the number of vaccines that come to market, the percentage of the population that chooses to get vaccinated, the effectiveness of each vaccine, and the duration of the centralized distribution model. These same dynamics are likely to have an impact on the levels of demand we see for products like COVID tests and PPE in fiscal 2022. And as I mentioned earlier, we have a new administration in Washington and our teams have been working closely with the new administration's transition team and now emerging team to ensure that the proposed reforms support solutions to improve cost, quality, and access. I'll reiterate that we continue to see stability in the core and strength in the underlying fundamentals of the business heading into fiscal 2022. We will continue to make strategic investments in the areas of oncology and biopharma services. So, in summary, through nine months, each quarter of the current fiscal year has proven to be different one to the next and the results we're sharing today reflect McKesson's ability to rise to the challenge and meet the evolving demands of our customers and partners. The pandemic has not put our strategy on hold, but has challenged us to continue to think differently and react more quickly against the dynamic macroeconomic backdrop. Before I close, I also want to touch on our commitment to our local and global communities. We're dedicated to doing our part to eliminate bias and promote equality. And we are proud to have been recently recognized as one of the best places to work for LGBTQ equality by the Human Rights Campaign for the eighth consecutive year. And we recently recruited Dr. Kelvin Baggett to newly created role of Chief Impact Officer, reporting to me, where he will be responsible for advancing our strategy and execution related to diversity, equity and inclusion, ESG and McKesson's overall social impact. We are excited to have Kelvin on the team. In the end, it all comes back to our people. The passion and the focus of our 80,000-plus employees are what make McKesson special. And without them, the work we're doing to combat the COVID-19 pandemic would not be possible. My greatest thanks to them all. Thank you for your time. And with that, I'll turn it over to Britt.
Britt Vitalone: Thank you, Brian. And good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to speak to you about another solid quarter for McKesson. Against a dynamic and challenging macroeconomic backdrop, we continued to respond to the evolving demand brought on by the pandemic, leveraging the breadth and scale of our distribution and services capabilities. The underlying core business continues to be fundamentally sound. And we've built solid revenue, operating profit and cash flow momentum over the past several quarters, which continued in the December quarter. Our solid broad-based third quarter results reflect this momentum. Our demonstrated delivery of consistent and stable organic growth, combined with the execution of the vaccine and kitting programs with the US government, are enabling us to further increase fiscal year 2021 guidance. As we mentioned during our first and second quarter earnings calls, we expected the non-linear recovery from the effects of the pandemic to persist for the remainder of our fiscal year and likely into our fiscal 2022. We saw this uneven recovery play out in Q3. COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations reached their highest levels. This led to some softening in recovery trends during the quarter. Prescription volumes were softer than the prior quarter. And Primary Care patient visits and elective procedures continued to remain below pre-COVID levels. Despite these challenges, in Q3, all segments delivered year-over-year adjusted operating profit growth. And year-to-date, adjusted earnings per diluted share grew 14% compared to the prior year. In the third quarter, we recognized a benefit from our work with the US government for assembling and distributing ancillary supply kits needed to administer COVID-19 vaccine. And while not material to the quarter, we also began distributing the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in late December. Volumes for COVID-related testing and personal protective equipment or PPE continued to remain high in our Medical segment, while the impacts of social distancing measures have resulted in soft cold and flu season. According to IQVIA, US adult food diagnosis were down approximately 10% compared to the prior year, which resulted in a lower generic flu stress [ph] And similar to last quarter, in the third quarter we recognized unplanned gains on equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio. Now on to our third quarter results, which can be found in the Investors section of our website. And let me start by pointing out two items that impacted our GAAP-only results in the quarter. Based on the substantial progress toward settlement of our ongoing opioid weighted claims, it is concluded that a broad settlement of opioid claims by governmental entities is now probable. It can be reasonably estimated. And as a result we reported a pretax charge of $8.1 billion, $6.7 billion after tax. Secondly, we recorded a pretax long-lived asset impairment charge of $115 million, primarily related to McKesson's Retail Pharmacy businesses in Canada and Europe. Let's move now to a discussion of our adjusted earnings results for the third quarter, starting with our consolidated results on slide four. Consolidated revenues of $62.6 billion were up 6% compared to the prior year, primarily due to market growth, higher specialty volumes in our US Pharmaceutical segment and COVID-related volumes in our Medical business, including COVID tests and PPE. This was partially offset by branded to generic conversions and the contribution of our German wholesale business through joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. Adjusted gross profit increased to 7% year-over-year, driven by growth in our Medical-Surgical segment, which once again benefited from the contribution of near-term opportunities, including distribution of COVID-19 tests and our work assembling ancillary supply kit for COVID-19 vaccine. Adjusted operating expenses increased 2% year-over-year, led by higher operating expenses to support growth in strategic investments across the business, partially offset by the contribution of our German wholesale business to the joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance, and a reduction in operating expenses due to the impact of COVID-19. Adjusted operating profit was $1.1 billion for the quarter, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year. When excluding the $51 million contributed by Change Healthcare in the prior year, which was previously recorded in Other, adjusted operating profit grew 18%, exceeding our expectations. Interest expense was $55 million in the quarter, a decline of 14% compared to the prior year, which was driven by lower commercial paper balances and the retirement of approximately $1 billion of debt. We now expect fiscal 2021 interest expense in the range of $210 million to $230 million. Our adjusted tax rate was 21.6% for the quarter, and we continue to assume a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 18% to 20%. Third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $4.50, which was up 21% in the quarter compared in the prior year, driven by a lower share count and growth in the Medical Surgical Solution segment. These items were partially offset by a higher tax rate and the lapping of the prior year contribution from the company's investment in Change Healthcare. Third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share also includes net pretax gains of approximately $30 million or $0.14 per diluted share, which is associated with McKesson's Ventures equity investment. Wrapping up our consolidated results, third quarter diluted weighted average shares were 161 million, a decrease of 10% year-over-year, driven by the successful tax-free exit of our investment in Change Healthcare at the end of fiscal 2020, which lowered our shares outstanding by approximately 15 point million shares and in addition to share repurchase activity in the current and prior year. We now expect diluted weighted shares outstanding for fiscal 2021 to be approximately 162 million. And next, I'll review our third quarter segment results, which can be found on slides five through 9, starting with US Pharmaceutical, where revenues were $49.5 billion, up 7%, driven by market growth and higher specialty volumes, partially offset by branded generic conversions. Adjusted operating profit increased 2% to $656 million, driven by growth in specialty, partially offset by higher operating expenses in support of our strategic growth initiatives, including Ontada. These investments accounted for an approximate 2% headwind to year-over-year segment growth. Our segment results were also negatively impacted by the light colder flu season. Given the timing of FDA approval of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine in December, earnings related to the vaccines distribution were immaterial in the third quarter. I'll provide more detail on our outlook related to COVID-19 vaccine distribution later in my remarks. And for the third quarter, branded price activity trended in line with our expectations. Additionally, based on manufacturer price actions taken in January, we are maintaining our full year fiscal 2021 assumption of branded price increases to be in the mid-single digit percent range. Next, International. Revenues were $9.3 billion, a decrease of 6% year-over-year. On an FX-adjusted basis, revenues decreased 10%, primarily driven by the contribution of our German wholesale business to the newly formed joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance, which was effective as of November 1st, 2020. The segment also had lower volumes in the Canadian Pharmaceutical distribution business, largely due to the exit of an unprofitable customer at the beginning of the fiscal year. Excluding the impact from the divestiture of our German wholesale business, segment revenue increased 4% year-over-year and was flat on an FX-adjusted basis. Adjusted operating profit increased 9% year-over-year to $158 million. On an FX-adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit increased 3% to $150 million, primarily driven by two additional sell days in the European business compared to the prior year. Now moving on to Medical-Surgical Solution. Our Medical-Surgical segment continues to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We experienced strong demand for COVID-19 tests throughout the quarter and often unpredictable and uneven levels of demand related to PPE. We're also pleased to have delivered solid growth in the core business, despite patient mobility trailing pre-COVID levels. Our customers have been resilient throughout the pandemic. And we're supporting providers and their patients with the breadth of our Primary and Extended Care capabilities, such as lab solutions, private brands and patient home delivery. Similar to the US Pharmaceutical segment, Q3 results were also impacted by the light colder flu season, and we expect this to continue throughout the remainder of our fiscal year. Revenues were $3.1 billion in the quarter, up 43%, primarily driven by demand for COVID-19 tests in the Primary and Extended Care businesses. As we discussed on the second quarter call, our Medical-Surgical business built supply quickly to meet demands from our customers for COVID-19 tests and elevated levels of demand for PPE. This elevated and uneven demand is reflected again in our third quarter results, as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations reached their highest levels, impacting patient mobility and elective procedures, which were down 15% to 20% at times in the quarter according to IQVIA. Throughout the pandemic, and as always, our focus has been meeting the needs of our customers and their patients, providing access to the supplies, including PPE that they need to continue to treat patients. Early on, we procured these products in a highly volatile market, with unpredictable supply and demand levels due to the impacts of the pandemic. Due to these dynamics, some PPE and related items experienced inventory charges. In our third quarter, we recorded $35 million of charges related to these products. For the quarter, adjusted operating profit increased 52% to $279 million, driven by demand for COVID-19 tests and the contribution from the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines, partially offset by the inventory charges on certain PPE-related products. Excluding the impact of the incremental PPE and COVID-19 test, adjusted operating profit in the segment is up 29% year-over-year in the third quarter. Next, Prescription Technology Solutions. Revenues were $777 million, an increase of 9%, driven by new and higher volumes of existing brand support programs. Adjusted operating profit increased 27% to $131 million, driven by organic growth in the business. While we continue to invest in the expansion of our technology offerings for our biopharma customers, we are starting to recognize the benefits of these investments, such as our investment in AMP, which Brian discussed earlier. Moving on to Corporate, McKesson recorded $158 million in adjusted corporate expenses in the quarter, a decrease of 6% year-over-year, driven by gains of approximately $30 million on equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio. This was partially offset by an increase in employee expenses, as well as lower interest income. This quarter, we had fair value adjustments related to several of our portfolio companies within McKesson Ventures. As I mentioned on our second quarter call, it's difficult to predict when gains or losses on our Venture portfolio companies may occur and therefore, our practice has been and will continue to be not include Ventures portfolio impacts in our guidance. And finally, we reported opioid-related litigation expenses of $34 million in the quarter and for fiscal 2021, we anticipate that opioid-related costs will be approximately $160 million. Turning now to cash, which can be found on slide 11, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.6 billion. And for the first nine months of the fiscal year, we generated - free cash flow of $745 million. Our working capital metrics can result in free cash flow vary from quarter-to-quarter, impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of a quarter. In fiscal '21, our cash flow dynamics have also been impacted by changing levels of customer demand. In Q3, we again saw higher levels of inventory, resulting primarily from increased quantities of COVID tests and PPE. As we work to meet the evolving needs of our customers and ramp-up our work with the US government, we may experience additional working capital volatility. Year-to-date, we made $427 million of capital expenditures, includes internal investments to support our COVID-19 vaccine and kitting efforts and technology, data, and analytics investments to support our strategic initiatives of Oncology and Biopharma services. For the first nine months of the fiscal year, we returned $709 million of cash to our shareholders through $500 million of share repurchases and the payment of $209 million in dividends. Let me now turn to our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2021. The COVID-19 virus and effects of the pandemic continue to impact our communities in different ways. The sharp declines across our businesses in the first quarter, followed by a more positive trajectory through our second quarter, indicated signs of stabilization. However, the third quarter was another good example of the non-linear shape of the recovery that we've been talking about all year, as increased case counts and hospitalizations led to a softening of the trends in the third quarter. Two important assumptions have underpinned our guidance throughout fiscal 2021, and we're reiterating those today. First, we do not assume a new wave of COVID-19 which would lead to shelter at home and economic lockdown, which would preclude patient mobility and consumption of health care services. And second, we do not assume any systemic customer insolvency event. I'd also like to reiterate that we believe that the recovery will take longer than initially anticipated and will not be in a straight line, as the impacts of the pandemic will persist into our fiscal 2022. Further, we do expect that there will continue to be significant volatility in the demand and ultimate volume levels for COVID-19 test kits and PPE. Through our third quarter, we've seen elevated levels of these product categories. However, we do expect these dynamic volumes will moderate. Also, given there is now an approved COVID-19 vaccine that is within the scope of McKesson's contract, our guidance now takes into account earnings related to COVID-19 vaccine distribution, in accordance with the distribution schedule provided to McKesson by the CDC. As a result of our solid third quarter performance and outlook for the remainder of the year, which now includes estimated earnings tied to the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, we are increasing and narrowing our adjusted earnings guidance range to $16.95 to $17.25 from our previous range of $16 to $16.50. We continue to anticipate consolidated revenues to increase between 2% to 4% for fiscal 2021. And we now expect the consolidated adjusted operating profit will grow 7% to 9% for the full year, excluding the results of Change Healthcare from the prior year, which is up from our prior guidance of an increase between 2% and 6%. Now moving to the segments. In our US Pharmaceutical segment, we continue to expect revenue growth of 3% to 6% and now expect adjusted operating profit to grow 2% to 5% compared to the prior year. We've included in our guidance the net benefit to fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings per diluted share of approximately $0. 25 to $0.35 related to our role as the centralized distributor for COVID-19 vaccine. This range is dependent on a number of factors, which includes final vaccine distribution volumes and product mix as directed by the CDC. I would also remind you of our continued commitment to invest in and extend our leading position in Oncology, where we are making incremental investments in the second half of fiscal 2021, which equates to a headwind of approximately $0.05 to $0.10 of adjusted EPS for fiscal 2021. In our International segment, we now expect a revenue decline of 5% to 9% year-over-year and segment adjusted operating profit to be 1% to 3% growth. Let me now turn to Medical-Surgical. The shifting pattern and recovery path of COVID-19 remains a pivotable variable within the Medical-Surgical supply market. As I referenced earlier, throughout the third quarter, we continued to see elevated levels of demand for COVID-19 test kits and PPE. We expect to see shift in volumes, which we anticipate will moderate. We expect these sales to be a near-term opportunity in the segment, and elevated levels of demand are factored into our guidance for the remainder of our fiscal year. During the quarter, we expanded our contract with HHS for the assembly and storage of COVID-19 ancillary supply kit and also contracted with Pfizer to distribute ancillary kits directed to administration sites on their behalf. Due to this expanded scope, we now expect a benefit of approximately $0.20 to $0.30 in FY '21 related to the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for the COVID-19 vaccine. Therefore, we now expect fiscal 2021 Medical-Surgical segment revenue to increase between 27% and 32%. And as a result of our improved third quarter performance and outlook, including the increase in our expected contribution from the kitting and distribution of ancillary vaccine supplies, we now expect adjusted operating profit will grow in the range of 29% to 37%. In our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we expect revenue to grow 5% to 8% and now expect adjusted operating profit to be approximately flat to the prior year. And finally, we now expect corporate expenses in the range of $645 million to $685 million. Let me wrap up our outlook with capital deployment. We continue to expect free cash flow of approximately $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion. As a reminder, we historically have generated the majority of our cash in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. This strong cash flow generation provides the financial flexibility to execute a balanced capital allocation approach, investing in our strategies of Oncology and Biopharma Services, positioning our business for long-term growth, while remaining committed to return capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases. Our investment-grade credit rating remains a priority and underpins our financial flexibility. In Q3, we utilized a portion of our free cash flow to retire approximately $1 billion of debt, and we issued a $500 million bond at attractive market rates. These actions, which were in line with our stated intent to modestly delever, further strengthened our balance sheet and our financial position. In closing, we're pleased with the results of our fiscal third quarter and we feel confident in our updated outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. I'm proud of our focus and execution across the business, despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. Investing in the strategies we've outlined remains a priority, as we drive further differentiation in our positions in Oncology and Biopharma Services, as evidenced by our continued investment in Ontada. As a proud partner of the US government and the COVID-19 vaccine effort, we look forward to continuing our role in the pandemic response, working to get vaccines and ancillary supplies into the communities that need them. And with that, Holly, let me turn the call back over to you for Q&A.
Holly Weiss: Thanks, Britt. We will now take questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator, please go ahead.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from - of Mr. Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Michael Cherny: Good morning. Thanks for all the color and congratulations on the strong results. I want to dive in a little if I can, to the pharma segment profit. Given the moving pieces you had in the investments in that segments, also with obviously the offset of the COVID vaccine. Can you just give us in terms of how you think about the implications for key growth, and also with all the market dynamics in place, how the trajectory should progress on the core pharma side, and packing out the puts and takes in terms of directionally or conceptually on the volume side versus some of the strategic investments versus the COVID benefits that you'll be seeing in that segment?
Brian Tyler: Sure. Let me start and Britt can add any color. I mean, we're very pleased with the results from our core Pharmaceutical business. I think, we see that kind of step back from COVID impacts, we'd say market fundamentals are consistent with where we thought they would be in the beginning of the year, brand price inflation in line with the dynamics that we see in the generics marketplace, both in terms of our go-to-market strategies and our sourcing capabilities are - we're pleased to see where they're at. I mean, we are continuing to invest in this segment. And that investment in particularly in the area of Oncology, comes at the expense of a little bit of what could be operating profit growth, but we think that that's a very important investment to make for the long-term positioning and the long-term growth of the segment. So I think in general, everybody recognizes the cold and cough and flu season was a little bit lighter than what we would historically have seen. Probably the result of the social responsibility, social distancing, mask wearing measures. But overall, we're very pleased with the progress of this segment.
Britt Vitalone: Yeah. Mike, maybe what I would just add is I think part of trends that we talked about, the softening trends in Q3, really, I think is going into Q4 a lot of that will depend on how the pandemic continues to persist, but despite that, we continue to grow in the quarter. So our business, despite the kind of lumpiness in the overall environment continues to grow, and we feel confident in that growth. As Brian mentioned, it continued to invest. And as I talked about, we invested about 2% of headwind year-over-year in Ontada. So I think as this continues to persist, as our vaccine distribution begins to take hold, we feel comfortable that the business is stable and is showing good - the fundamentals of it are strong, and the growth is still there. And again, that allows us to continue to make investments for further growth going forward.
Holly Weiss: Operator, next question please?
Operator: The next will be Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa Gill: Thanks very much. Good morning. So Britt, I know I asked this a couple of weeks ago at my conference, and that's around the actual profitability per dose on the vaccine. So now that, that you've given some numbers, you talked about 25 million doses being on target. Not a lot of impacts in the third quarter. You talked about the $0.25 to $0.35. How do I think about that on a per dose basis? Number one. And then number two, there's been some news articles talking about your two chief competitors saying, hey, we'll help out with the vaccine distribution as well. Would - what would that potentially do as far as the amount of volume that McKesson would potentially get given your current contract?
Britt Vitalone: Good morning, Lisa. Thank you for that question. Let me start, and I think Brian will probably want to tackle on your - some of your later questions. Just to clarify. What Brian talked about in his remarks was $25 million of doses through January, 25 million doses through January. And as I talked about the amount that was in our quarter was immaterial to our results. We don't get into a per dose conversation. What we have guided here is based on the distribution volumes that we've been provided by the CDC, and we expect that that will deliver $0.25 to $0.35 of contribution in our fourth quarter.
Brian Tyler: Yeah, let me - and to the second point, Lisa, a lot of people have offered their help and support of the vaccine distribution program, and we appreciate everyone's desire to help facilitate the nation getting itself vaccinated. In our view, we think the centralized distribution model that we have is the safest and the fastest way to get these COVID vaccines into the arms of people. We have built capacity to ramp-up to provide hundreds of millions of doses. And we think it's the fastest, safest way. And by that, I mean it's the least time from the time an order is delivered to that vaccine arriving at a provider site. It's the least handoffs and handling and chances for temperature excursions or lost product or damaged product. So in essence, it's going to allow us to get the very - the maximum amount of doses out of what is produced and available from the manufacturers in the fastest time. Now to the extent we can find ways to be faster, we're open for any idea. Make no mistake, our goal is to get this product to into patients' arms as quickly as we can so that we can get this country vaccinated and back to a more normal environment.
Holly Weiss: Operator, next question?
Operator: And next will be Eric Coldwell from Baird.
Eric Coldwell: Thanks very much and good morning and sorry toggling several calls this morning. I want to just follow-up on one thing here quickly if you addressed it, I apologize. I know you've talked about the 25 million doses mostly in the month of January so far. I guess a couple of questions around that. First off, are you able to provide your expectations for total doses in fiscal for 4Q specifically? So the next two months how much that might ramp.
Britt Vitalone: Our - the guidance we provided ties to the schedule we have been provided by the CDC and just like every other major customer we have, we don't comment on their plans and business strategies. So we are not able to talk about that, but the guidance we provide it ties to the schedule we've been provided by the CDC.
Eric Coldwell: That's - okay. Fair enough. And then just on - my follow up on that was the kitting opportunity. Obviously, you've assembled a tremendous number of kids today you're making 10 million to 15 million a month or a week, excuse me. I'm just curious does the kitting opportunity extend into fiscal '22? Are you so advanced on what you've assembled to date that, that opportunity really ends in fiscal '21 even if the vaccines obviously extend into fiscal 2022?
Brian Tyler: Yeah. Eric, thank you for the question. Obviously, as we think about the kitting opportunity, we produce kits in advance of the vaccine. So we talked about that on our Q2 call. I think it's a little early to tell how far this will actually play out. We would expect that some kitting would continue on beyond our fiscal year. But it's hard to say at this point, how to value that. So we feel good about increasing the guidance range for the kits that we expect to produce this year. I think that you could expect to see some kitting into next year. I guess it will all really depend on the distribution schedule that we get from the CDC and what the volumes are this year.
Holly Weiss: Operator, next question?
Operator: Next will be Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Jones: Great. Thanks for the question. I guess maybe just to shift gears over to Med-Surg, EBIT there was particularly strong in the quarter. Britt, I know you shared what the increased contribution you're viewing from kitting and other ancillary COVID-related supplies. But I am just wondering even taking that out, it was a particularly strong result, just given where that business has been and I know utilization hasn't exactly been even or strong in this environment. So I was hoping maybe you could just talk a little bit about what's driving the growth kind of X, the vaccine kitting related items that you quantified?
Britt Vitalone: Yeah. Good morning. Thank you for that question. You're right, our core business was continue - did continue to be very solid into the quarter. And I tried to call out a little bit for you in my remarks, what our growth was excluding COVID tests and PPE. So that gives you some sense that we did continue to see solid momentum into our quarter. I talked about a few of the items and certainly, Brian can elaborate on as well. But if you think about our business, it is across all settings of alternate site. And as we've talked about in prior calls, our product breadth is very large, private brand, labs solutions, certainly the depth of capabilities that we have in extended care, patient home delivery, it's a very broad set of solutions capabilities and customer set that we address, and we've seen that really continue to grow in a very stable way over the last several quarters now.
Holly Weiss: Operator, next question?
Operator: And next will be Charles Rhyee with Cowen.
Charles Rhyee: Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just two quick ones. Britt, maybe just to clarify, you talked about the $0.20 to $0.30 from kitting. I think last call, you talked about $0.15 to $0.20, so is this an incremental 2030? Or is it really, are we talking about just kind of a bump of $0.05 to $0.10? And then secondly, in the drug - International Drug Retail business, you obviously took an impairment charge here. Was there any benefit? I think one of your peers talked about receiving some funding from NHS. Just wanted to see if that was something that you guys were also benefiting from? Thanks.
Brian Tyler: Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Let me take the first one quickly. The $0.20 to $0.30 is not incremental, it's $0.20 to $0.30 from $0.15 to $0.20. So we did increase it from the last by that $0.05 to $0.10. In terms of the International question, the NHS funding that you referenced here was fairly immaterial to our quarter.
Holly Weiss: Operator, next question?
Operator: And next Eric Percher with Nephron Research.
Eric Percher: Thank you. So in Medical, I think a lot of questions on kitting, vaccine. Am I wrong to expect that this is really testing-driven strength? And we look at the testing numbers, they seem to have doubled or tripled from quarter to quarter to quarter. So is that really the primary driver? And is the supply there continuing to expand in ways that will enable you to continue facilitating that?
Brian Tyler: Eric, thank you for the question. I would say it's really both things. I mean, I think the PPE demand has remained elevated and strong. That's certainly contributing. And there's no question that as COVID test kits emerged on the scene - or remember, when we provided our guide at the beginning of this year, there wasn't such a thing as a COVID test. So as the scientific community, the lab community began to develop these tests, whether molecular, antigen, antibody, because of our existing business in the lab, we were really well positioned to help get those to market quickly and swiftly. And we have certainly benefited from the strong demand for COVID test kits.
Britt Vitalone: And Eric, maybe I'll just add on. I did try to call out in my comments here that, while this has been elevated, and we've seen sort of an uneven supply and demand throughout the year, we do expect that this will moderate. Now we expect the elevated demands to remain through our fiscal year, but we do expect at some point in FY '22, these elevated levels of demand will moderate.
Holly Weiss: Operator, next question?
Operator: And next will be Jailendra Singh with Credit Suisse.
Jailendra Singh: Yeah. Thank you. Actually quick clarification on vaccine. Does the vaccine EPS contribution take into account additional vaccines receiving approval for use in the US? And then my main question, I want to better understand the $100 million increase to the company's CapEx guidance. Is that all related to building out more infrastructure for COVID vaccine distribution beyond fiscal '21? Any color there will be helpful.
Brian Tyler: Yeah. I'll just start with the guide for the vaccine. It is tied to the schedule that the CDC has provided us, which would be largely consistent with what you read in the public statements.
Britt Vitalone: And I'll take the CapEx one. We did increase our guide on CapEx. Part of that is to support the vaccine and kitting programs. But a larger part of that is really continuing to invest in our strategies, technology, data and analytics to support those strategies. So I would say that a portion of that is to support the infrastructure, but a larger portion of that is really to support ongoing growth initiatives.
Holly Weiss: Operator, next question?
Operator: And next will be Glen Santangelo with Guggenheim Securities.
Glen Santangelo: Thanks for taking my question. Hey, Brian, I appreciate there's probably not much you can say with respect to the opioid settlement at this point. But if we assume for a second that it does come to fruition as you outlined, I wanted to ask about the potential impact on the future capital deployment algorithm. And to that, you know, if we look at the after-tax settlement over 18 years, maybe netting that against some of the legal costs that go away, it looks like it could consume roughly 10% to 15% of your free cash flow. And so I'm trying to reconcile the future capital deployment versus maintaining the investment grade rating on the balance sheet? Thanks.
Brian Tyler: Thanks, Glen. Well, you mentioned a couple of things that I'll come back to in my answer. One is we are very focused on maintaining our investment grade credit rating. We think we have a business that generates good cash flow. We have a strong balance sheet. We've had time to contemplate this. So I think, philosophically, our approach to capital deployment will not change, it will be a balance. We look to make internal investments that we think support growth in the business. We look to make growth investments in M&A where we can find targets that are aligned to our strategy and offer a financial return that makes sense vis-à-vis other ways we can deploy capital like buying back shares or paying a dividend. So I don't think our philosophy changes at all. And I think we feel very comfortable that we have a strong balance sheet.
Holly Weiss: Operator next question.
Operator: And next will be Rivka Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Rivka Goldwasser: Yeah, hi. Good morning. So taking everything that you said on the vaccine, and I understand that you're looking - you're basing it on the guidelines. The CDC guidelines are for about $100 million. So just wanted to confirm that that's what we should think about as we think that, what's included in your guidance. But if we take that and we extrapolate sort of the - what you are guiding for the fourth quarter, we're getting to sort of an average benefit of about $1 in 2022. So while I know that it's early to talk about 2022, is going to guide in May. But maybe you can - but clearly, vaccine is going to be a nice tailwind. So maybe you can just offer us some color on what tailwinds and headwinds should we just be considering as we think about 2022?
Brian Tyler: Well, let me talk about the - your opening comments on vaccine, the vaccine itself, and then maybe Britt can give us a few headwinds and tailwinds. First, just to reiterate, our guidance is based on the schedule that the CDC has provided to McKesson. We've been working to that schedule from day one, and that is what we base our forward guide on and we can't really comment on that. So I just want to make that clear. And then, Britt, I don't know if you want to start down your list - our list of puts and takes?
Britt Vitalone: Yeah. Thank you for the question, Rivka. I mean, I really start with what I think are some strengths and some tailwinds in the business, and we've talked about these really over the last several quarters now. We've had good momentum for several quarters now where we're seeing organic growth, and Q3 is a good example of that where each of our operating segments grew over the prior year. We would expect that our - the fundamentals of our business will continue to be solid and sound. And we're starting to see some benefits from the investments, some of the investments that we're making. Brian talked about AMP. And clearly, we've talked about the investments we're making in Ontada. So the strategies and the investments in Oncology and Biopharma Services, I would expect will continue to be strengths of ours. Obviously, the breadth of our Medical business, as we talked about earlier, the breadth of our customers, the breadth of services and capabilities across private brand and lab will continue to be strong for us. So I think as you look across our operating segments, we have a lot of good momentum and strength. We have a very strong balance sheet. As Brian just mentioned, we've seen consistent cash flow. From a headwinds perspective, I think it will really be how long does the pandemic persist and the unevenness and unpredictability of that. I think that will be the thing that we will be challenged with. But as you've seen from our results this year, we've been able to manage through that quite well and take down some near-term opportunities at the same time.
Holly Weiss: Operator we have time for one more question, please.
Operator: Certainly, that question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays.
Steven Valiquette: So when we think about the $0.25 to $0.35 EPS related to COVID vaccine distribution, the additional $0.20 to $0.30 from McKesson's supplies, is the 100% of this combined EPS being derived in the US? I just want to confirm that. And can you remind us about the potential for McKesson to capture international economics on either the COVID vaccines or kits in Canada or Europe and where that stands either for the remainder of fiscal '21 or maybe a greater opportunity in your fiscal '22? Thanks.
Britt Vitalone: I'll start. Great question. Let me just clarify, for the kitting component of this, the $0.20 to $0.30 is not incremental to last quarter. It's $0.20 to $0.30 from $0.15 to $0.20. What we've talked about here, both for the vaccine contribution and the kitting and supply contribution are US contributions. And I'll let Brian maybe talk a little bit about our international.
Brian Tyler: Yeah. Look, our international countries and companies are engaged with local governments to - you know, either through our distribution capabilities, our retail pharmacy capabilities, to help the response of those countries to the pandemic. I would say, as a general characterization or probably from a time line trailing the US a little bit, but we are heavily involved in those discussions, but nothing that would be material to our financials at this point.
Brian Tyler: Okay. Thank you, everyone, for your questions, and thank you Susan, for facilitating this call. I want to conclude my remarks today by once again recognizing and thanking all the frontline health care workers across the world who are working day in and day out to keep us safe and also acknowledge the great work from our biopharma scientific community to have us at this helpful moment as it relates to vaccinations. Our company's top priority is the vaccination program. And we look forward to continuing to work with the US government to successfully distribute COVID-19 vaccines and stand ready to support the distribution of additional vaccines, as they come to market. I want to thank the entire McKesson team for their continued commitment and hard work during this challenging time. We wish you all and your families' good health and wellness. Thanks again for joining us today.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect. And have a great day.

===== 2021 Q2  (2020-11-03 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the McKesson's Q2 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Holly Weiss, please go ahead.
Holly Weiss: Thank you. Good morning and welcome everyone to McKesson's Second Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, such as forecast about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's press release and our slide presentation and to the Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Additional information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results is included in today's press release and presentation slides which are available on our website at investor.mckesson.com. With that, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Holly and good morning everybody. Thank you for joining us on this [Technical Difficulty] in United States. Today is obviously an important day, a day which every citizen can vote should have the opportunity to exercise this civic right regardless of who’s in the White House, we look forward to working with the administration and the new Congress to ensure a strong and safe economic recovery, while keeping the Healthcare supply chain running and continuing to deliver for our customers on the front lines of this pandemic. Today, we reported second quarter total company revenues of $60.8 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.80, both ahead of prior year and our revised expectations we laid out in August. I’d like to thank the people who make up Team McKesson for their resilience, their dedication, their flexibility and ability to manage through change. The first half of fiscal 2021 has certainly played out differently than the original expectations we provided to you in May. You recall that based on the positive signs of recovery at the end of our first quarter, we raised our guidance for fiscal 2021. In our second quarter, we again saw volumes increase compared to the low points earlier in the first quarter while patient mobility and prescription volumes showed improvement and stability. The recovery continues to be non-linear as the word we’ve adopted and our second quarter results are a good example of the unpredictability of the pace and the trajectory of the recovery. In addition, the pandemic has caused customer needs to evolve and repivot it quickly to meet the incremental demands and needs. Investments in the business and customer relationships particularly in our medical business have positioned us well to serve our customers during this unprecedented time. New demand for product categories such as COVID-19 test, and elevated demand for PPE have contributed meaningfully to our results year-to-date. While short-term upside we do not anticipate the elevated levels of demand for these products in the long-term. Our results year-to-date are underpinned by three dynamics. First and foremost, the shape and pace of the recovery has been different than we had originally contemplated in May. Following a sharp recovery to the end of the first quarter, we continue to see modest improvement in the second quarter but with signs the recovery will not fully happen in our fiscal 2021, most likely extending well into the calendar year 2021. And given current COVID-19 infection rate volatility we expect a non-linear recovery. Second, the fundamentals in the business remains solid and our execution has continued to improve. Lastly, discrete one-time gains in the second quarter and short-term opportunities present near term upside for the fiscal year. As a result of our performance in the quarter, and our improved outlook across the business, we are raising and narrowing our fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings per diluted share to $guidance range to $16.50 per diluted share. This is up from our previous range of $14.70 to $15.50 per diluted share. Since the onset of the pandemic McKesson has partnered with government agencies at the Federal State and local level along with other industry leaders to help find solutions to the most complex and pressing issues the crisis presented. This critical work once again speaks to the important role we play in the healthcare supply chain and to the depth of McKesson's expertise in sourcing, picking, packing and distributing supplies to sites of care across the U.S. Our role in the supply chain was highlighted in the quarter through expanded partnerships with the U.S. Government, specifically supporting Operation Warp Speed Similar to our role in the 2009 to 2010 period, the H1N1 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention engaged us to expand our existing partnership under the Vaccines for Children program to support the U.S. Government's Operation Warp Speed team as a centralized distributor of future COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies needed to administer those vaccines. McKesson's role in the H1N1 response was a proud moment in our history over 10 years ago and we're very honored to serve in a similar capacity as we help support the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic I do want to take a moment to just clarify the scope of McKesson's involvement in Operation Warp Speed. We will be the centralized distributor for refrigerated and frozen vaccine types, once approved by the FDA. Ultra frozen vaccines, which are those requiring temperatures of minus 60 degree Celsius or colder are not within the scope of McKesson's contract with the CDC. In the centralized model, the U.S. Government directs McKesson on the distribution of the vaccines and related supplies to point-of-care sites across the country. McKesson will make no allocation or prioritization decisions and we will not have any influence on which vaccine is shipped to which location. While it's still early in the process and a vaccine is not yet been approved for distribution, our role in Operation Warp Speed has been and will continue to be our Company's top priority since we were selected by the CDC in August. We've been working to scale up the infrastructure necessary to be ready to distribute approved vaccines as soon as they are available. Given the uncertainty around the timing and volume of vaccines that may become available, future earnings tied to the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, as a centralized distributor for the U.S. Government, are not reflected in our current outlook. McKesson was also selected by the U.S. Government to manage the assembly and distribution of the ancillary supplies needed to administer the future COVID-19 vaccines. We're partnering with the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, to help equip healthcare professionals with the supplies they need to safely and efficiently administer COVID-19 vaccines once they're available. Supplies like syringes, alcohol prep pads, face shields and more will be selected and grouped together as directed by the HHS for future distribution to point-of-care settings across the country. We quickly ramped up our capacity outfitting and staffing four distribution center locations for assembling and storing the ancillary kits to be used in the administration of the COVID-19 vaccines once approved. Each kit contains enough supplies to be used for the administration of 100 plus vaccines. Our teams have been hard at work assembling these kits as part of the preparation needed when the vaccine is approved. Given the scope of our work with the HHS is well defined and that the work has begun the economics from this contract are factored into our improved outlook for fiscal 2021. We are honored and proud to serve the U.S. government in this dual role, and we believe it will help streamline delivery to frontline, and provide the most expeditious access possible to the COVID-19 vaccines. Before I elaborate on our second quarter results, I wanted to provide just a brief update on our board of directors. In mid-October, our board of directors welcomed Linda Mantia, as a new independent director. Linda most recently served as a Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer for Manulife Financial Corporation, where she played a critical role in defining Manulife’s corporate strategy and oversaw its innovation portfolio. She brings over 25 years of experience managing extensive financial services, operations and digital technology. Linda's appointment demonstrates our continuing commitment to refresh and diversify the experience backgrounds and perspectives on our board. Now let's get into the business. I'll remind you that this is our first quarter reporting in the new segment structure we announced back in July. I'll summarize the second quarter and then I'll turn it over to Britt to provide more details. U.S. Pharmaceuticals results in the quarter exceeded our expectations and reflect improved script and patient mobility trends versus the levels we experienced in the first quarter. Specialty volumes, particularly oncology, have continued to be resilient throughout the pandemic. Oncology patient visits, inclusive of telehealth visits returned to pre-COVID levels in the quarter and our provider solutions in U.S. oncology business continued to grow and are well positioned as innovative specialty products and biosimilars come to market. Our U.S. oncology research team recently celebrated a significant milestone. We have now been part of the trial process for 100 FDA approved cancer therapies. This achievement is the result of the hard work and the dedication to research for more than 165 research locations, conducting and participating in over 1600 clinical trials for cancer therapy. Our health mart franchises continue to play a vital role in community healthcare as they roll out COVID-19 testing efforts and expand immunization capabilities ahead of this year's influenza season. Transitioning to our international segment. As part of our segment realignment, we brought together our strong presence and non-U.S. based drug distribution and retail operations in Canada and Europe. Together, these businesses are positioned to further leverage the company's global footprint to drive value across key differentiators like the company's own retail pharmacy assets. I remind you as part of the reorganization in August, we named Rebecca McKillican, as the Chief Executive Officer for McKesson, Canada. She succeeded Domenic Pilla, who retired in August. I'm encouraged by the performance of our international business as we found ways to meet the changing customer demands and contain our costs. We continue to invest in the digitization of healthcare in both Canada and Europe. We've invested in new state of the art distribution centers to support digital growth and our e-commerce platforms in Canada our Well.ca business was recognized for the second year in a row as a leader in digital customer experience. And in Europe, Our Echo by LloydsPharmacy platform in the U.K. remains the U.Ks fastest growing pharmacy. I'm pleased to announce that on November 1, we completed the creation of a joint-venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance to combine our pharmaceutical wholesale businesses in Germany. As a reminder, WBA owns 70% controlling equity interest in the joint-venture and McKesson holds the remaining 30% ownership interest. We have a continuous process in place to look at review and evaluate our portfolio and our strategy. Sometimes the outcome is we find assets that were not the natural owner of or as was the case in this transaction, we believe that combining our German wholesale businesses with that of WBA is the right decision to secure the long term success of both businesses. The combined businesses will strengthen the ability to compete and deliver high customer satisfaction through evolving our customer value proposition and delivering on operational excellence. Let me move to Medical. Demand continued to improve across the businesses in the quarter. As physician offices reopened across the U.S., the pandemic has also created new demand for products like COVID-19 tests, and an unprecedented level of demand for PPE across the segment, both of which we view as near term drivers of growth in the segment. We're proud to have a leading position in the distribution of lab equipment and solutions in the provider space. Over the past several years, we've developed relationships with many lab partners and help position our providers with the tools they need to deliver better patient outcomes. Our investments in our lab business and in our private brand portfolio continue to position us to serve our customers evolving needs, particularly in times like these. Also, to meet this incremental demand, we work quickly to strengthen our sourcing partnerships around the globe. We've built our inventory across several product categories to be ready for incremental and often unpredictable levels of demand from our customers, improve patient mobility and a continuation of near term opportunities for McKesson to meet our customers evolving demands contribute to the revised outlook for the segment. Turning to Prescription Technology Solutions, we'll refer to as RxTS for shorthand, which brings together our RelayHealth pharmacy, our CoverMyMeds, and our RxCrossroads businesses. I want to just spend a minute here on the evolution of these businesses into the reportable segment it is today. Overtime, we have acquired capabilities that together create a broad set of commercial services businesses. RelayHealth is an asset that's been in the McKesson family dating back to 2006. This business processes over 19 billion transactions a year and connects us to over 50,000 U.S. pharmacies, giving us access to the workflow of the vast majority of pharmacies in the U.S. with the goal of delivering value added services directly into this pharmacy workflow. In 2017, we acquired CoverMyMeds whose mission is to help patients get access to the appropriate drugs for their care by automating and accelerating the prescription approval process known as electronic prior authorization, and otherwise very manual and very time consuming process. This business gave us access to the workflow of over 700,000 providers by automating the insurance approval process for drug coverage. And most recently, in 2018, we acquired RxCrossroads, a business that expanded our services and solutions for our biopharma partners, and gave us disease state expertise specifically focused on specialty therapies. Bringing these businesses together under one leadership team allows us to have a more cohesive strategy and a highly coordinated go-to-market effort. Together, these businesses help to connect pharmacies, providers, payers and biopharma for next-generation patient access and adherence solutions. Last quarter I talked about one of these solutions that we've continued to invest in, and how we've been able to reduce the average time to therapy by 18 days. Just one year ago, we had one brand on the platform. Today, we have several brands live and a good growing pipeline. Expanding our brand support programs for our biopharma partners help to offset the impact of lower prescription volume trends, specifically new prescriptions in the quarter. As an important part of our strategy, we are continuing to invest in these businesses so that we can provide innovative solutions for biopharma and these investment dollars are reflected in our results in the segment year-to-date. Summarizing at the enterprise level, while we expected challenges in the quarter, we significantly exceeded our expectations and it is in large part due to the execution of our 80,000 employees. Our teams move quickly and decisively to react to the evolving customer needs and our expanded government partnerships. I continue to just be so impressed by our teammates, particularly those on the front lines for their unwavering focus and dedication during this incredibly challenging time. And as part of our appreciation, we again made special payments to our frontline employees recognizing their courage and their service to our company, our customers, and frontline caregivers for these past several months. I mentioned how the second quarter was a good example of the non-linearity of the recovery, as our results far exceeded our original and even revised expectations. While we're encouraged by the positive trajectory of the recovery, we continue to believe a full recovery back to pre-COVID levels will take longer than we originally contemplated and is unlikely to occur within our fiscal year. We continue to expect in the second half of the year as compared to the prior year, driven by an improved market near term demand from our customers and our current work in the U.S. government assembling the ancillary kits to go along with future COVID vaccines once approved. While some of the tailwinds I mentioned are expected to be near term, we believe we have made the investments necessary to position us as a partner of choice for our customers and manufacturers to about this time on our -- would be changed. And that I thought McKesson was well positioned to respond and react to that change. And I believe the second quarter was a clear example of how McKesson shines when faced with challenges and new opportunities. Despite an evolving market landscape, we remain focused on executing against our priorities, which now proudly includes playing an even larger role in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, leveraging our deep expertise as we partner with the U.S. government on future COVID-19 vaccine efforts. I'm so proud of the execution I’ve seen across the business in the first half of fiscal 2021 and the dedication of our employees remains unmatched in my view. Thank you for your time this morning. And with that, let me hand it over to Britt to elaborate.
Britt Vitalone: Thank you, Brian. And good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share results in the second quarter. We delivered growth over our prior results and exceeded the expectations that we laid out on our Q1 earnings call despite an extremely volatile and challenging macro environment. We couldn't be more proud of the way our teams have executed and continue to deliver and innovate through this unprecedented period of uncertainty. We delivered solid core performance across our businesses in the quarter, including new product volumes and elevated demand in our medical surgical segment. This new volume includes an increase in the sales of COVID-19 tests, and increased volumes of personal protective equipment as we continue to respond to the needs of our customers during the pandemic. We also recognize gains in equity investments within our McKesson ventures portfolio, and I'll provide further detail on this. As a reminder, in our first quarter, we were impacted across our businesses by economic lockdowns and social distancing, which led to decreased healthcare utilization across the geographies that we operate in. However, in June, we began to see an acceleration of demand as volumes recovered earlier than we originally anticipated. As I mentioned during our Q1 earnings call, we expected a non-linear recovery from the effects of the pandemic over the remainder of our fiscal year. And we saw the non-linear course and recovery continue to play out in our second quarter results. Prescription volumes recovered from their lowest levels earlier in our fiscal year, although not back to pre-COVID levels. In primary care, patient visits continued to improve at a rate faster than we had anticipated. As Brian mentioned, in the second quarter, we observed increased volumes for COVID related products, particularly COVID tests as we stocked up to meet demands for additional testing and supplies, including personal protective equipment. We continue to respond to the dynamic and fluid environment and we're pleased with our execution throughout the first half of our fiscal year. This morning, I'll provide commentary on our second quarter results, and an update on the key assumptions that support our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2021. And my comments today will relate to our new segment structure. Let's turn now to our second quarter results, the summary of which including updated guidance can be found in the investors section of our website. And I'll start by pointing out two items that impacted our GAAP only results in the quarter. First within U.S. Pharmaceutical, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $50 million for an estimated liability related to the New York State Opioid Stewardship Act or OSA. The charge is the estimated share of the New York OSA surcharge for calendar years 2017 and 2018. As a reminder, we recorded an approval in the first and second quarter of fiscal 2019 for the estimated portion of the annual assessment under the OSA. The OSA was later ruled unconstitutional and the accrual was reversed in the third quarter of our fiscal 2019. That ruling was reversed in September of 2020. And therefore we took a charge in our fiscal second quarter. Secondly, within our international segment, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $69 million which was associated with segment realignment. Now to a discussion of adjusted earnings results for the second quarter, starting with our consolidated results on slide four. Consolidated revenues of $60.8 billion were up 6% compared to the prior year, primarily due to market growth, and higher volumes from retail national account customers in our U.S. pharmaceutical segment. Adjusted gross profit increased 4% year-over-year, driven by growth in our medical surgical segment, which saw increased demand for COVID-19 tests in higher volumes from customers in the U.S. pharmaceutical segment. Adjusted operating expenses increased 5% year-over-year, led by increased technology spend, which was partially offset by reduction in operating expenses due to the impact of COVID-19. Adjusted operating profit was $953 million for the quarter, an increase of 3% compared to the prior year, when excluding the $39 million contributed by Change Healthcare in the prior year, which was previously recorded in other. Adjusted operating profit grew 8%, which was ahead of our expectations. Interest expense was $50 million in the quarter decline of 22% compared to the prior year, due to lower commercial paper balances. And we now expect interest expense in fiscal 2021 to be between $220 million and $240 million. Our adjusted tax rate was 7.2% for the quarter in the range that we indicated on our first quarter earnings call in August. During the quarter, we realized discrete tax benefits of approximately $129 million. And we continue to assume a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 18% to 20%. Second quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $4.80, which was up 33% in the quarter compared to the prior year, driven by a lower share count, a lower tax rate and operating performance led by the growth in the medical surgical solution segment. These items were partially offset by the lapping of the prior year contribution from the company's investment in Change Healthcare. Second [ph] quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share also includes net pre-tax gains of approximately $49 million or $0.22 per diluted share associated with McKesson Ventures Equity Investments. Wrapping up our consolidated results, second quarter diluted weighted average shares were 163 million, a decrease of 11% year-over-year, which was driven by the successful exit of our investment in Change Healthcare, lowering our shares outstanding by approximately 15.4 million shares, and due to prior year share repurchases. Next I'll review our second quarter segment results which can be found on slides five through nine. As a reminder, effective with the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the customer revised its segment reporting structure. We now report results in four reportable segments, which include U.S. Pharmaceutical, International, Medical Surgical Solutions, and Prescription Technology Solutions, or RxTS. And I'll start with U.S. Pharmaceutical where revenues were $48.1 billion, up 5% driven by market growth in higher retail national account volumes, partially offset by brand generic conversions. In our Specialty Businesses, particularly in our U.S. Oncolocy Network, we saw patient visits approach pre-COVID levels. Adjusted operating profit increased 3% to $658 million, driven by growth in Specialty, partially offset by higher operating expenses in support of our strategic growth initiatives. In the segment adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 137 basis points, which was a decrease of three basis points. Next on to International, where revenues were $9.5 billion in increase of 2% year-over-year. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues decreased 1% primarily driven by lower volumes in the Canadian Pharmaceutical Distribution business, which was largely due to the exit of an unprofitable customer at the beginning of the fiscal year. This was partially offset by higher volumes in the European Pharmaceutical Distribution, and retail pharmacy businesses. Adjusted operating profit increased 20% year-over-year to $116 million. On an FX adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit increased 19% to $115 million driven by lower European operating expenses, including continued cost reduction initiatives and cost mitigation efforts in response to COVID-19. The segment adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 122 basis point, which was an increase of 18 basis points. As Brian mentioned in his remarks, yesterday, we announced the completed contribution of our German wholesale business to a newly formed joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. WBA now holds a 70% controlling equity interest in the JV and McKesson holds the remaining 30%. Going forward, McKesson will no longer consolidate the operating results of its German wholesale business, will recognize the 30% share of the JV earnings and losses in other income within our international segment. Moving on to Medical Surgical Solutions, we continue to see trends improve during the quarter. According to an October aculiar [Ph] report, primary care patient visits reached approximately 91% of the pre-COVID baseline. Our medical surgical business continues to play a vital role in the COVID-19 pandemic ramping up to meet customer demand with our delivery of COVID-19 tests and personal protective equipment. revenues were $2.5 billion in the quarter up 23% driven by higher volumes of COVID-19 test in personal protective equipment in both our primary care and extended care businesses. Adjusted operating profit increased 27% to $210 million driven by demand for COVID-19 test, early flu season volumes and contributions from the extended care business. In the segement adjusted operating margin was 829 basis points, an increase of 22 basis points. Next, Prescription Technology Solutions, revenues were $668 million an increase of 7% driven by new brand support programs which were partially offset by the impact of lower prescription volume trends. Adjusted operating profit decreased 10% to $104 million, which was driven by higher operating expense investment to support the company’s biopharma service growth initiative. For the past several quarters, we’ve outlined our strategic investment into the products and services within RxTS resulting in higher operating expenses to support future growth. We expect to continue to invest in the expansion of our technology offerings for our retail and biopharma customers to support the future operating profit growth of this segment. The segment adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 15.57% down from 18.37% in the prior year. And moving to Corporate, McKesson reported $135 million in adjusted corporate expenses in the quarter, an increase of 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by increased technology costs and lower interest income. This increase was largely offset by net gains of approximately $49 million on equity investments within our McKesson ventures portfolio. Now McKesson Ventures portfolio holds equity investments in several growth stage, digital health and services companies and we're pleased with the portfolio result and the insights obtained. While mark-to-market valuations in this quarter resulted in gains from three of our investments. The impacts were consolidated financials can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment, quarter-to-quarter. As a result, McKesson’s investments may result in gains or losses, the timing and magnitude which can vary for each investment. It's difficult to predict when gains or losses on our venture portfolio companies may occur and therefore our practise has been and will continue to not include Ventures portfolio activity in our guidance. And finally, we reported opioid related litigation expenses of $41 million in the quarter and for fiscal 2021, we continue to anticipate that opioid related legal costs will be approximately $160 million. Turning now to cash, which can be found on slide 11. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.1 billion. For the first half of fiscal 2021, we had negative free cash flow of $306 million. Our working capital metrics and resulting free cash flow varied from quarter to quarter and were impacted by timing included the day of the week that marks the close of the quarter. Looking at the cash flow dynamics, we saw higher levels of inventory this quarter, primarily resulting from the increased quantities of COVID testing and personal protective equipment and our participation in Operation Warp Speed. As we prepare for continued larger quantities of personal protective equipment, and Operation Warp Speed activity, we may experience additional working capital volatility. Year-to-date we made $265 million of capital expenditures led by internal investments in areas such as technology and continued investment in our strategic growth initiatives. We also made investments in data and analytics capabilities across the enterprise. For the first six months of the fiscal year, we returned $388 million of cash to our shareholders to $248 million of share repurchases and the payment of $140 million in dividends. We have $1.3 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorisation and we continue to expect diluted weighted shares outstanding in the range of $161 million to $163 million. Let me now turn to our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2021. As we've seen over the past several months, the trajectory of the COVID virus can change quickly, as evidenced by recent increases in case numbers in many parts of North America, in Europe. On our Q4 FY20, and Q1 earnings calls, we outlined two assumptions underlie our guidance for fiscal 2021 that we are reiterating today. First, we do not assume a new wave of COVID-19, which would lead to shelter at home and economic lockdown, which would preclude patient mobility and consumption of Healthcare Services. And second, we do not assume any systemic customer insolvency events. We continue to believe that the recovery will take longer than initially anticipated, and it will not be linear, as the full impact of the pandemic is likely to persist beyond the fiscal year. The non-linear nature of the recovery continued in our second quarter. As a result of our second quarter performance and outlook for the remainder of the year, including near term opportunities related to COVID-19 demand, we're increasing our adjusted earnings guidance range to $16 to $16.50 from our previous range of $14.70 to $15.50. While our guidance does not take into account any revenues or earnings related to future COVID-19 vaccine distribution, it does include volumes for marketing program in our medical surgical segment, which I'll provide more details on shortly. We anticipate consolidated revenues to increase 2% to 4% for fiscal 2021, and we now expect the consolidated adjusted operating profitable growth 2% to 6% for the full year, when excluding the results of Change Healthcare from the prior year, an increase from our prior guidance of a decline between 1% and 4%. We continue to anticipate enterprise adjusted operating profit to grow sequentially throughout fiscal 2021. And now on to the Segments. In our U.S. Pharmaceutical Segment, we expect revenue growth of 3% to 6% and segment adjusted operating profit to grow 1% to 4% compared to the prior year. This takes into account improved volumes, particularly in our specialty businesses. In our International Segment, we expect a revenue decline of 5% to 10% year-over-year, and segment adjusted operating profit to be flat to 4% growth driven by the performance in our European business. Let me now provide some details on our Medical Surgical Segment. As discussed in my opening remarks throughout the quarter, we saw increasing volumes of COVID-19 tests. We expect these sales to be a near term opportunity in the segment, and it's factored into our guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2021. We've also seen increased volumes of personal protective equipment. This category remains vital as we support our customers during the pandemic. We expect that volumes will continue to fluctuate through the balance of the year. As the largest seasonal flu vaccine distributor in the U.S., we continue to prepare for the influenza season, which is particularly important this year due to the impacts of COVID-19 and the nation's healthcare system. While it's too early to predict how the flu season will progress, we're actively preparing to meet the needs of our customers. As Brian mentioned in his remarks, we're also partnering with HHS on preparing and storing ancillary kits to be used in the administration of future COVID-19 vaccine. We’ve included in our guidance the net benefit to adjusted earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.15 to $0.20 in the second half of our fiscal year related to our partnership with HHS. As a result, we now expect fiscal 2021 Medical Surgical Segment revenue to increase between 20% and 25% and segment adjusted operating profit to grow in the range of 8% to 18%. In our Prescription Technology Solution segment, we expect segment revenue to grow 5% to 10% and segment adjusted operating profit in the range of down 5% to flat. We expect to improve it in this segment over the second half of the fiscal year as we continue to realize the benefits of our strategic investments. As this is our first quarter, reporting Prescription Technology Solutions segment, I want to provide some background in the drivers within the segment. Brian discussed in his remarks how this segment brings together our RelayHealth Pharmacy, CoverMyMeds and RxCrossroads businesses. Volumes in a RelayHealth and CoverMyMeds businesses are driven by pharmaceutical transactions including prior authorizations. Volumes in these businesses are also driven by adding drug brands to the existing platforms and services that we offer to our biopharma and pharmacy partners. Moving on to Corporate, we now expect corporate expenses in the range of $625 million to $675 million. Our Corporate guidance takes into account increased technology investments and the impact of our second quarter equity investment gains and our McKesson Ventures portfolio as previously discussed. Let me wrap up our outlook by turning to cash flow. We continue to expect free cash flow of approximately $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion. As a reminder, we historically have generated the majority of our cash in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. This consistent cash flow generation provides the financial flexibility to continue investing in our strategic initiatives, which position our business for long term growth. Our investment grade credit rating remains a priority and underpins our financial flexibility. We have two bonds totaling approximately $1 billion, which mature during the second half of our fiscal year. We intend to utilize a portion of our free cash flow to modestly deliver by up to $500 million, further strengthening our balance sheet and financial position. And we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through a modest dividend and through share buybacks. In closing, we're pleased with the results of our fiscal second quarter and we're confident in our updated outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Our focus and execution should drive another full year of operating profit growth, despite a challenging and competitive environment. We will continue to invest in high growth, high margin markets in strategic areas that will further leverage our differentiated positions in oncology and biopharma services. We're proud of our expanding partnerships as we work on the COVID-19 vaccine effort, and continue to be an important part of the pandemic response to maintain supply chain stability. And with that, Holly, let me turn the call back to you for Q&A.
Holly Weiss: Thank you. We will now take questions. In the interest of time, please limit yourself to just one question to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator?
Brian Tyler: Operator, can we go to questions please?
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Eric Percher from Nephron Research. Your line is now open.
Eric Percher: Thank you. Your role enabling the vaccination distribution is of great interest. Brian, could you help us understand what's required operationally, it sounds like you're developing some new DCs as well as using some of the existing infrastructure. And then Brett, can you help us understand the financial flows from a government contract of this type? Is some of the initial government investment flow through the P&L? And should we think of this as paid for preparation, or is it really tied to the amount of volume that ultimately moves through?
Brian Tyler: Well, good morning, Eric. Thanks for the question. We're fortunate to have had a H1N1 experience about a decade ago and provided a bit of a roadmap or a playbook for us to execute. I mean, based on the volumes that we've been given and projections, we have quickly been engaged in standing up some new facilities both for the vaccine distribution and for the kidding and frankly for just some storage. That is all in-flight on plan tracking, but yes, it will be -- it's a big effort to stand up several new facilities and onboard a lot of new employees, but something that we've successfully done in the past.
Britt Vitalone: Eric, let me address your second question. There's a couple different elements to this program. As we've talked about, previously, we were reimbursed for some of the costs to set up these new facilities. We will also when a vaccine is approved and we begin distribution, we’ll recognize a fair value for the services that we perform, similar to a third party logistics provider that's on the vaccine side. Obviously, that hasn't started yet. As the -- there's not been a vaccine that's been approved. On the kitting side, it will be very similar to you know, how we prepare kits that we did in H1N1 as we prepare kits, and produce those kits will recognize revenue as those kits are prepared and produced.
Holly Weiss: Next question, operator.
Operator: And next will be Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Robert Jones: Great, thanks for the question. I guess maybe just to stick with COVID, but look looking at the Med-Surg segment; it appeared that EBIT in the quarter, came in somewhere roughly around 50 million higher than what was implied relative to the back half guidance you guys had given previously. Just wanted to see if you could share or help us understand kind of what drove the performance as it relates to the increase in COVID-19 tests that you mentioned. And then the increased demand for PPE just trying to really get some context around just what the contribution has looked like in that segment from COVID test and PPE would be helpful?
Brian Tyler: Sure, thanks for the question. I'll start certainly, as the year has progressed we've seen some momentum in that -- in the segment, what we talked about in both of our comments and what we've seen through the through our second quarter, is that COVID-19 tests and personal protective equipment have increased in volume throughout the quarter. So they're a key driver for that. We also I also touched on early vaccine, flu vaccine sales, so too early to call the flu season, but we did see earlier of flu vaccine sales, and we had anticipated a little bit stronger than we had anticipated in the quarter. And we're seeing really strong underlying performance as flu vaccine, sales start to pick up as COVID-19 test kits pick up that really helps the core business, it drives more primary care visits, drives more supplies within our core business. So I think all of those things really play together. But certainly COVID-19 tests and personal protective equipment are key drivers in the quarter, and key drivers for our full year race.
Holly Weiss: Next question, operator?
Operator: And next will be Stephen Baxter from Wolfe Research. Sir, your line is now open.
Stephen Baxter: Thanks. Wanted to ask about the trajectory and seasonality of the Prescription Technology Business. It seems like the full year guidance implies a pretty big step up in EBIT relative the way you just posted for Q2. So I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the factors driving this increase whether there's anything to do with, some of the timing of investment spend that you cited in the release. And then just in general, what's the right way to think about seasonality in this business, trying to understand that we should be thinking about future periods using the second half of fiscal 2021 as a baseline or if there's other considerations that we should be keeping in mind. Thanks.
Britt Vitalone: Yes, appreciate that question. I'll start and then Brian can certainly elaborate. We have been making investments into this business. We think that this is a business where innovation can happen. And so we've been increasing our investments over the last year or so. And we'll continue to do that. Certainly, one of the things that we've noticed here is that lower prescription volume trends versus the prior year, particularly new prescriptions, or new branded prescriptions, has had an impact on that business from a top line perspective. We do expect that the second half of the year, we'll see some very strong growth. And typically in this business, you can expect that the fourth quarter is a little bit stronger seasonally than the other three quarter. So I think it's a few things. It's been the lower prescription volume trends year-over-year, investments that we continue to make in the business to drive new brand programs and innovation. And then we expect that the back half of the year will be stronger and typically seasonally, Q4 is a little bit stronger than the other three quarters of the year.
Brian Tyler: And not much to add to that other than we do think as we bring these businesses together and look at the connectivity we have and the providers and pharmacies we look at the automation experience and tools we have, and the expertise in various disease states. We think this is a growing part of the market. And there, we have opportunities to invest internally and innovation that will deliver superior returns over time. And we're we continue and are committed to making those investments.
Holly Weiss: Next question?
Operator: Next will be Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Your line is now open.
Kevin Caliendo: Thanks, and thanks for taking my call. Just a PPE question. You're saying demand is gone up. Your inventory levels have gone up. I guess, I'd like to understand the dynamics around the pricing of PPE and how that affects your revenues and/or or profit. PPE prices seem to be stabilizing or maybe coming down a little bit. But then also we're hearing there's a shortage of nitrile gloves. Can you just talk a little bit about pricing dynamics change your profit in the PPE segment?
Brian Tyler: Yes, sure. Maybe I'll just make a couple of general comments. We certainly have seen higher demand for these products over the course of the year. That demand can continued through the second quarter, more in the COVID 19 test kits in the second quarter, but PPE has been heavy demand as well. And look, we have very good and solid relationships from a logistics perspective with many different suppliers. We believe that that allows us to source competitively and clearly the market is it's a competitive market on the sell side. But again, we've seen some stability in the pricing in the first half of the year, but it's a volatile market, there's a lot of, the demand is changing as the year goes on. And our sourcing will adjust to that. And so what we're really trying to call out here is that we've seen a lot of demand in the first half of the year. It's been kind of volatile, and we would expect that we'll see good demand in the second half of the year, but certainly not in a straight line. But we feel that the relationships that we have with our suppliers put us in a good position to meet the customer demand.
Holly Weiss: Next question.
Operator: And next will be Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Lisa Gill: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Brian, just going back to your comments around Specialty and the resilience on the oncology side. If I start to think about biosimilars coming to the market, especially in the oncology area, one, can you talk about if there were any benefit from biosimilars in the quarter? And then secondly, if you or Britt can help us to understand the margin differential and the opportunity around biosimilars as we think about strengthen your Specialty business?
Brian Tyler: Sure, we've got a very strong provider base for specialty products, and that's our we call sometimes our non-affiliated or non-U.S. oncology and our U.S. oncology. The Oncology business in particular, I think, has been pretty resilient, probably visits even at the trough period or relatively stronger than many of the other specialties. And what we're seeing now is it combined the physical patient visits with the telehealth activities, we're seeing volumes really get back almost to pre-COVID levels. And, we have a tremendous footprint in that business. We have a broad set of scaled assets. And one of the things that where we think we'll be able to do and are doing and will continue to expand over time is take advantage of not just biosimilars, but other new speciality products that launch into that space. So, our conviction in the community provider settings and how -- what important role we think it plays in the healthcare landscape, and we continue to invest and expand our offerings to position us to take advantage of those opportunities.
Britt Vitalone: Lisa, maybe just to touch on your the last part. We have seen that biosimilars have grown this year. We’ve seen more biosimilars launch into the space particularly into specialty provider and oncology. We think that biosimilars are a win win win. They're lower cost opportunities for patients, they provide economics for physicians, and they certainly provide better economics for us. So we like that biosimilars are continuing to develop. They're not very material yet, but they do continue to grow. And certainly they provide better costs for the patient, the physician and better margin opportunity for McKesson.
Holly Weiss: Next question.
Operator: And next will be Jailendra Singh from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Jailendra Singh: Hi. Thanks, everyone. Quickly, a couple of clarification on the second half versus first half outlook. Your Medical-Surgical segment revenues, of course, it now includes the benefit from vaccine distribution in second half. But can you give us any flavor around what is the second half outlook on Med-Surg business on apples-to-apples basis compared with 9% growth you had in first half? And same thing on International segment, what is driving that high-single to low-double-digit decline for second half outlook versus down 3% in first half?
Brian Tyler: Thank you for the question. And I'll let Britt respond to it. But just to clarify, the medical business really is not the vaccine distribution, but it's the kitting operation or the production and storage of the kits that will support the administration of the vaccine. 
Britt Vitalone: Right. Thanks, Brian. And so what we are seeing in our second half is a continuation of some of the momentum that we saw in the first half, we expect that COVID-19 tests will continue to be a big portion of the business in the second half of the year. Our core business continues to have very strong momentum. And then as Brian just clarified, we do, we did put in guidance to kitting portion of the contract that will drive some top lines as well as the $0.15 to $0.20 of adjusted earnings that I called out. So what we have in our medical surgical business is a very broad based business that we've talked about many times across primary care, extended care. And we continue to grow there. And the opportunities that we have now through our relationships with lab suppliers and others is just providing additional momentum in the business.
Holly Weiss: Next question.
Operator: And next will be Michael Cherny from Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Michael Cherny: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I want to dive in a little bit on the U.S. pharma side, and particularly thinking about how the pacing of growth this quarter could influence or impact the growth in the back half of the year. You noted some of the higher volumes from retail national accounts. This is despite what appears to be market wide softness and what you've been called to in terms of the pacing of recovery. So heading into the second half of the year, outside of Specialty which I know you already addressed. What are the key drivers to support U.S. pharma revenue growth in particular? And how should we think about how those should drop down to the bottom line and incremental margins?
Britt Vitalone: Yes, I'll start. And certainly Brian can elaborate. I think what we are seeing in our U.S. pharmaceutical business, just to be clear, it's our traditional U.S. wholesale business to independence to retail national accounts and the health systems. We're seeing pretty good stability in that business. Now we're seeing quarter-to-quarter stable position, stable growth. You add to that the position that we have in our specialty provider businesses, the opportunities that we're seeing in oncology, and what you're seeing is a business now that is growing at a stable, you know, 2% to 4% that we’ve seen over the last several quarters. So I don't think there's anything specific. I think it's just the good execution, the stability of our customers and the stability of the environment, that's really allowing us to continue to perform.
Brian Tyler: Yes, I think that the brand market has been relatively stable, the generic markets been relatively stable. And we've been very focused on cost and efficiency initiatives in this business to help underpin that.
Holly Weiss: Next question.
Operator: Next will be George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
George Hill: Hey, good morning, Britt and Brian. Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering if you guys would quantify or detail, both from an office procedure perspective, and maybe from an RX volumes perspective, what percent of baseline you guys expect to achieve in the back half of the year as it relates to volumes. I know in the press release, it says you're still not expecting kind of a return to baseline, but we'd love to know what percentage you guys are thinking of getting back to?
Brian Tyler: Yes, great question. And always a little bit risky to prognosticate in the current environment. I mean, even given the way we've seen the disease progress in Europe in the U.S. in the last several weeks, shows the volatility that's still out there in the marketplace. I mean, you'll recall we early in the year, when we gave our first guidance, we assumed Q1 was going to be the trough that Q2 would get sequentially better, Q3 would get better. And by Q4, we would be back to what we call pre-COVID levels. If you think about the way the years unfolded, we had really high volatility in the first quarter, month-to-month, even week-to-week, the swings were pretty challenging. I think we saw that begin to stabilize a little bit as we got midway through Q2, and the trend lines started to look like they were they were leveling out a little bit. And so that's what gives us the pause or the revised view, I guess that that we won't get back to full pre-COVID elective procedures, physician office visits and scripts by Q4, but the recovery is likely to extend in well into the calendar 2021. And so that's our current view. And that's what we worked into our guidance.
Holly Weiss: Next question.
Operator: Next will be Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Your line is open.
Steven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So, you touched on this for the US just a minute ago. But, I guess, I'm curious to hear about the Rx volume progression throughout the quarter for Europe. Maybe any early color on trends in October as well, just given that some of the region in Europe seem to be going back into lockdown mode? Thanks.
Brian Tyler: Yes, we track these trends in Europe very closely. And frankly, what you see is it's really not a Europe trend. It's a country by country trend depending on how the COVID virus itself progresses and how local governments react to react with their social policy closed down, locked down and things of that nature. So it really is very different. We saw France for example, tended to be ahead of the U.K. and the way it experienced these waves. But the general theme has been pretty consistent. Then we had the trough and the key one period we had slow strengthening. We're very proud of the way our teams have operated there. Our pharmacies are open. They're servicing their communities. They've adopted all the new safety protocols and standards that enable them to provide that continuity of care. But I'd say at a macro level, I mean, while there is definitely difference between countries and the way, the way country governments react, it's generally the same.
Holly Weiss: Next question.
Operator: And next will be Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Ricky Goldwasser: Yes, hi. Good morning. As a quick follow-up question on the COVID vaccine benefit, if we think qualitatively about the relative contribution from kitting versus vaccine, how should we think about these two? Is vaccine contributions, in general, qualitatively tend to be higher than the kitting or vice versa? Thinking about the broader potential opportunity.
Brian Tyler: Yes, thanks for the question, Ricky. Yes, we've only quantified our relationship on the kitting side, that's really all that we can quantify at this point. We don't have a vaccine approved. So it's too early for us to really provide you any guidance on that. And I wouldn't try to relate the two, they're very different programs. I would say though, that the kitting program does provide us the opportunity to continue to expand our relationship with the government and others. We certainly have all the capabilities. And that's why we were selected to be able to continue to expand our capabilities and services. So we're focused right now on the programs that are in flight, but certainly there are opportunities for us beyond that.
Holly Weiss: Next question.
Operator: And next will be Glen Santangelo from Guggenheim Investment. Your line is open.
Glen Santangelo: Oh, yes. Thanks for taking my questions. Brian, I just want to follow up and maybe pivot towards the opioid litigation status. It's been a while since we've heard anything on this front. And, in the press release, you seem to suggest that you're going to reserve some monies for settling with the state of New York potentially. I was just kind of curious. I mean, has COVID really slowed the process here, it felt like we were making much greater progress in the beginning of the year tracking towards the settlement. Now it feels like, there's some inertia in the process. And I just kind of curious if you can maybe give us an update on any signposts that we should look out from this point.
Britt Vitalone: Hey Glen, just before Brian jumps in there, I just want to clear up. The New York charge that we took was related to the surcharge that was enacted in 2017, and 2018. And so what we're doing here is just picking up the approval for the reversal of that court litigation suit back in 2019. So it's not related to the larger opiod settlement at all.
Brian Tyler: Yes, great, I I was going to make that point. So, I mean -- and as regards to the larger discussions, I mean, I think it's fair to say there was a few months' period there where the nations and the AGs and the distributors focus was on responding to a pandemic. But that -- we're now in the eight-month of this. And just like all of us have had to find ways to return to normal business. We continue to be engaged with the AGs. We continue to believe we're making progress in the discussions. We continue to be hopeful we'll reach a broad resolution, because we think that that's the best way to accelerate relief for people and communities that have been impacted by various health crisis at this point. So, we remain very focused and hopeful.
Holly Weiss: Operator, we have time for one more question.
Operator: Certainly. And that question will come from Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore. Your line is open.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys, thanks for the question. And I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more in terms of details on AMP. Just in terms of like how you see the trajectory of that growing the types of drugs and potential and potentially also how you guys positive value proposition to customers and sort of if you could comment anything on margin, so that would be helpful. Thanks.
Brian Tyler: So I mean, relative to AMP. I mean, I really think about this, as you know, there are existing models out there to do access and adherence. That really frankly, hasn't haven't really innovated too much in a long time. And the opportunity we see here is to bring really the disease state expertise, the expertise we have over two decades supporting these access adherence like programs, but then leveraging the technologies that we have in a Relay or a CoverMyMeds to essentially automate and that process more efficient. Get patients started on their therapies quicker, help them adhere to them longer so that ultimately they get better health outcomes. And so, it's really the combination of these things, this kind of redesigning access and adherence model. And we've been very pleased with our early partnerships and the development of this, we've been very quick to take it from concept into market, and it's been quite encouraging and nice to see the number of brands on that program grow and the pipeline continue to expand.
Brian Tyler: Okay, well, I'd like to apologize for running a few minutes late. We wanted to be provide as much insight as we could on the call. I want to thank everybody for your great questions and thank Raul, for helping facilitate this call. I'm going to conclude my remarks today by once again thanking all of the frontline workers across the world who are working day in and day out to keep us healthy and keep us safe. And I want to recognize the great work of the McKesson team all 80,000 of them for their persistence, for their commitment, for their energy, resiliency during this time, they really are playing a vital part in keeping our communities healthy as well. So I wish you all a very good day. I hope you voted if you haven't, please do. And with that, we'll talk to you next quarter.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

===== 2021 Q1  (2020-08-03 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the McKesson's First Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Holly Weiss, please go ahead.
Holly Weiss: Thank you, Alyssa. Good morning and welcome everyone to McKesson's First Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, such as forecast about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's press release and our slide presentation and to the Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Additional information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results is included in today's press release and presentation slides which are available on our website at investor.mckesson.com. With that, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Holly and good morning everybody. Thank you for being with us on this morning's call. I hope that you, your families and your communities are staying healthy and safe. On our fourth quarter call in May I discussed that we were entering the new fiscal year with macro uncertainties and volatility in healthcare consumption patterns as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. And our first quarter results clearly reflect the effects of these dynamics. Today we are reporting results for one of the most complicated quarters in our Company's history. Our first quarter adjusted results while materially down against prior year due to the pandemic, finished significantly above our original expectations. We reported first quarter total company revenues of $55.7 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.77, both ahead of our original expectations. Through April and May, trends in the business aligned closely with our original expectations. However, we saw volumes across the business improve significantly over the back half of June, resulting in a strong close to the quarter. Based on our first quarter results and the current shape of the recovery versus our original expectations, we're raising our fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance range to $14.70 to $15.50 per diluted share. This is up from our previous range of $13.95 to $14.75 per diluted share. Despite the uncertainty brought on by the pandemic, our focus is on executing against what is within our control and that execution really underpinned our strong finish to the quarter, as customer demand began to improve from the troughs we experienced in April and May. From the beginning, our top priority has been to navigate the challenges and the fluidity of the situation brought on by the pandemic by focusing first on protecting the health and safety of our teams, so that we could continue to meet the needs of our customers and keep the healthcare supply chain operating at a high level. We've committed to increase safety measures for our employees and have maintained an unwavering commitment to our customers and our communities. In May, I talked about the essential role McKesson plays in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to partner closely with manufacturers and various government entities, so that we can react quickly as demand pattern shift with the spread of the COVID-19 virus. One such area that has evolved is the demand for personal protective equipment or PPE as frontline workers and our customers work to help treat and keep patients safe. We work with supplier partners, federal, state and local governments to get higher volumes of PPE to areas of critical need. Our partnership with Walmart to produce and deliver medical gallons in the US has continued to increase total gallon supply with over 30 million gallons shipped to the US since April. We're also continuing to invest in our communities. Our foundation made contributions to over a dozen food banks in some of the nation's most vulnerable areas. These investments translate into more than 6 million meals for individuals who would otherwise go hungry. Before I expand on our first quarter results, I want to provide just a brief update on the macro environment and the trends we've seen over the past 75 days, since we reported our fourth quarter fiscal 2020 results and issued our fiscal 2021 outlook. COVID-19 has continued to progress and persist here in the US, in ways we couldn't have predicted when we initially provided our outlook for fiscal '21. Several states including Texas where I am today are experiencing significantly higher numbers of cases, while others -- other parts of the country and frankly the world are in very different and various forms of recovery. This variability makes predicting an aggregate timeline for the recovery challenging. As we detailed on our fourth quarter call, we expected the most severe impacts to our business in the fiscal first quarter. And as a reminder, our original outlook assume the pandemic would have the most material impacts on our businesses with physician and specialty provider and oncology exposure. We expected a gradual stabilization beginning in our fiscal second quarter and ramping over the remainder of the fiscal year as doctors' offices reopen and patients return to their treatments. Through April and May, our results were largely in line with our original expectations with volumes across the enterprise materially down versus the prior year and well below pre-COVID levels. What we experienced in June however was an earlier than expected pace of recovery particularly the last weeks of the quarter, resulting in demand acceleration and higher volumes versus our original expectations. These impacts were the most pronounced in the primary care business within our Medical segment. Primary care patient visits showed encouraging signs of improvement in June, as patients returned to their doctors following the relaxation of shelter-at-home guidelines. Now turning to the business. I'll summarize the first quarter and then I'll turn the call over to Britt to elaborate. US pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions exceeded our original expectations in the quarter, underpinned by strong execution and improving volume trends in the business in the back half of June. Market stability, our disciplined approach to pricing and a growing specialty market continue to be foundations for us to build upon. We're very pleased to have recently renewed our distribution agreement with the buyer's alliance, sometimes referred to as TBA and doing so maintaining our disciplined approach to the market. I would remind you TVA [ph] is a group consisting of several health systems, retail national accounts and small and medium chain pharmacies. We're always looking for how we can best serve our customers and help them grow their business. This was evidenced by the growth in our specialty provider business in the midst of this pandemic, driven in small part by improved adoption of biosimilars in the quarter. While our specialty business recovered more quickly than we had assumed following the initial downturns in demand, we have certainly had to adapt to meet the needs of patients. At the onset of the pandemic, the US Oncology Network developed a rollout plan for telemedicine. And within four weeks, 80% of our network positions were able to initiate telemedicine follow-up visits and new consultations with their patients. To date more than 120,000 telemedicine visits have taken place with over 1250 providers. Our improved outlook for fiscal 2021 in the segment reflects the positive trends we saw in the quarter across the portfolio versus our original expectations. Let me make a few comments on Europe. While each of the 13 countries we operate in have had different responses and recoveries during the pandemic, we're encouraged by the segment's results in the first quarter. We also continue to take actions to better position the business for future growth, as evidenced by our ongoing efforts to evaluate our footprint and cost structure in our largest market, the UK. In the UK market, I'd remind you that our owned retail pharmacies are very healthcare focused with up to 90% of our mix coming from pharmaceutical volumes. While lower foot traffic through our pharmacies with a headwind in the quarter, our downside was limited due to our relatively small exposure to the front shop categories. A good example of how we're evolving this business is our 2019 acquisition of a company called Echo, now operating as Echo by Lloyds Pharmacy. This is an online prescription fulfillment business in the UK. It's all -- it is -- it was a timely acquisition for us, particularly given the impacts of the pandemic to meet customer demands in uncertain times. Our investment in our digital health care strategy in the UK has helped position the business to benefit from movement of patients to home and to omnichannel services. Let me move on to Medical. As I discussed earlier, in June we experienced a sharp increase in demand across our primary care sites. This directly correlates to the reopening of physician offices and resumption of performing elective procedures as patients started to feel more comfortable returning to their doctors and healthcare providers. In addition to a stabilization in primary care volumes as the quarter closed, our leading position in our lab business also puts us in a good place to respond to customer and patient needs during the pandemic. We have a strong history in this channel and as customers need solutions for COVID-19 and as our manufacturer partners develop and launch testing solutions, we remain a partner of choice and a leader across alternate site settings of care. The trends we witnessed in June combined with our improved outlook for the business over the remainder of this fiscal year give us confidence in our significantly improved outlook for this segment. Turning to Other, which now primarily consists of Canada and McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions following the separation of our investment in Change Healthcare in fiscal 2020. We're encouraged by the trends we saw in Canada to end the quarter as volumes began to approach pre-COVID levels in our distribution and retail businesses. Within the retail setting, our focus remains on building an enhanced customer experience through investments in people and reconfigured pharmacy formats. This has helped to strengthen our fundamentals and the role that community pharmacy plays in the Canadian healthcare system, which is especially important in times like these. Our owned Canadian pharmacies are continuing to evolve and will soon offer e-commerce and e-Prescribing platforms creating additional options for Canadian consumers, who want both a physical and digital shopping experience. Within MRxTS, we're making progress with our investments to create technology offerings that resonate with our retail and biopharma customers. Since launching in September of 2019, Access for More Patients. a product we call AMP has helped automate access to therapies for complex and chronic diseases, reducing the time to therapy by 18-days on average and we're continuing to expand the brand's taking advantage of this offering. The collaboration between our RxCrossroads and CoverMyMeds businesses to develop AMP is a good example of how our business evolves to meet the needs of our customers. As part of our ongoing evolution on July 1st, we announced the re-segmentation of our businesses effective in the second quarter of this fiscal year. We believe that this new organization structure better positions McKesson to focus and execute against our growth strategies and to meet the changing needs of our customers. With this re-segmentation, two new segments have been established, International and Prescription Technology Solutions. Kevin Kettler has assumed responsibility for the new International segment, which combines McKesson Europe and our Canadian business. Nathan Mott will lead the new Prescription Technology Solutions segment, which has been expanded to include the RxCrossroads business formerly reported as part of McKesson Life Sciences within our US Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment. In the quarter we also appointed Tom Rodgers as Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy and Business Development Officer. Tom brings more than 25 years of experience working in both emerging companies and large health care environments. In summary, we certainly faced unprecedented headwinds to begin fiscal 2021, but we're encouraged by the signs of recovery across our businesses as we exit our first quarter. We still believe the first quarter will be the trough of the recovery curve with the most material impacts in the business. We are pleased our first quarter results exceeded our expectations, reflecting great execution by our teams. The path to recovery over the remainder of our fiscal year is unlikely to be linear and we will continue to closely monitor the progression of COVID-19 through our communities and its implications for our business. The pandemic has reinforced the need for us to be agile in response to both customer demands and the ways in which patients choose to consume health care. One theme through the pandemic has been change and I believe McKesson is well positioned to respond to change, as the macro environment around us continues to evolve, McKesson will continue to evolve. I believe we have exited the quarter in a much stronger position than we entered it, stable fundamentals across the business, paired with focused execution against our strategic growth initiatives, give me confidence that McKesson will adapt to the near-term uncertainties and ultimately be positioned to thrive long-term. Thank you very much for your time. With that, I'll hand it over to you, Britt.
Britt Vitalone: Thank you, Brian and good morning everyone. My comments today will relate to our existing segment structure. As Brian discussed in his opening comments effective with the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we'll begin to report our financial results in four reportable segments, US Pharmaceutical, International, Medical-Surgical Solutions and Prescription Technology Solutions. We will issue a recast of financials in the new segment structure ahead of our second quarter earnings call to assist with your modeling under the new structure. Our June quarter was a testament to McKesson's ability to execute during challenging times. Our results speak to the dedication of our people, the resilience of our business and the important leadership role that McKesson plays in the healthcare supply chain. This morning I'll provide commentary on our first quarter results and I'll provide an update on the key assumptions that underpin our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2021. Throughout my comments this morning I'll provide an update of the recent trends we are observing and the implications to our fiscal 2021 results. As expected, our first quarter was severely impacted by the global pandemic as lockdown and social distancing requirements placed unique pressures on our customers and patients. We navigated the quarter with a combination of discipline and focus to what we continue to believe will be peak levels of global lockdown and restrictions. In the first quarter, we finished ahead of the expectations that we laid out in May on our fourth quarter fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. Those expectations included our assumption that patient visits in the physician, specialty provider and oncology segments and pharmacy interactions in our US, Canadian and European markets would bottom out and gradually improve beginning with our second quarter. Through April and May, the relative shape of the recovery curve was in line with this original guidance framework. However, as we progress through June, we began to see an acceleration of demand as volumes across our business has recovered at an earlier pace than our original outlook had contemplated. This increase in demand largely track the easing of restrictions and openings of markets across the world. Prescription transactions, patient interactions and elective procedures began to recover sooner than we had anticipated and had favorable volume impacts that were most pronounced in our Medical-Surgical and Specialty businesses. Let me turn now to our first quarter results. The summary of our first quarter results and updated guidance assumptions can be found in our first quarter earnings slide presentation, which is posted on the Investors Section of our website. Before I provide more details on our first quarter adjusted results, I want to point out one item that impacted our GAAP only results in the quarter. During the first quarter, we recorded an after-tax gain of $97 million for insurance proceeds received in connection with the settlement of the shareholder derivative action related to McKesson's controlled substances monitoring program. Now let's transition to a discussion of our adjusted earnings results for the first quarter, starting with our consolidated results on slide four. First quarter consolidated revenues of $55.7 million were flat compared to the prior year. Market growth and higher retail national account volumes within the US Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment were offset by lower prescription volumes and primary care patient visits, primarily a result of the negative impact from COVID-19. Although flat-to-prior year, this result exceeded our original expectations for the quarter. First quarter adjusted gross profit was down 4% year-over-year, as lower prescription transaction volumes and mix were results of the pandemic. First quarter adjusted operating expenses decreased 2% year-over-year, driven by cost mitigation efforts in response to the headwinds presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. These were partially offset by increased investments in the business. Adjusted operating profit was $707 million for the quarter, a decrease of 24% as compared to the prior year. When excluding the results of Change Healthcare from the prior year, adjusted operating profit was down approximately 14%, again ahead of our expectations. Interest expense was $60 million in the quarter, an increase of 7% compared to the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate was 22.3% for the quarter. We continue to assume a full-year adjusted tax rate of approximately 18% to 20%, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter and includes anticipated discrete tax items that we expect to realize during the course of the year. We anticipate reporting a favorable tax discrete item in our fiscal second quarter, which would result in the second quarter adjusted tax rate of approximately 5% to 10%. I would remind you that this could vary as a result of the mix of our worldwide earnings. First quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $2.77, down 16% in the quarter compared to the prior year, primarily driven by the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across the business and the lapping of prior year contribution from the company's investment in Change Healthcare. These items were partially offset by a lower share count compared to the prior year. In wrapping up our consolidated results, our first quarter diluted weighted average shares were $163 million, a decrease of 14% year-over-year, driven by the successful exit of our investment in Change Healthcare, which lowered our shares outstanding by approximately 15.4 million shares and due to prior year share repurchases. Next, I'll review our segment results, which can be found on slides five through seven and I'll start with US Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions. Revenues were $45.1 billion for the quarter, which were up 2% driven by market growth in higher retail national account volumes. This was partially offset by branded generic conversions and the negative impact of COVID-19 on prescription transaction volumes. Prescription transaction volumes were uneven in April and May, improved throughout the quarter and were above our expectations in June. Oncology visits were approximately 70% of pre-pandemic levels in April, however, improved over 95% in June. In telemedicine visits and our oncology practices now account for up to 15% of all visits. First quarter adjusted operating profit decreased 2% to $589 million, driven by lower volumes as a result of a pandemic and strategic investments, including our oncology portfolio partially offset by growth in the provider solutions business. The segment adjusted operating margin for the first quarter was 131 basis points, a decrease of 5 basis points. Next I'll talk about European Pharmaceutical Solutions, where revenues were $6.2 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 7% year-over-year. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues decreased 4% driven by the negative impact of the pandemic on the pharmaceutical distribution and retail pharmacy businesses partially offset by two extra sell days in the period compared to the prior year. First quarter adjusted operating profit was flat year-over-year at $35 million. On an FX adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit increased 3% to $36 million, driven by lower operating expense in two additional sell days in the period, when compared to the prior year, partially offset by lower volumes due to the pandemic. The segment adjusted operating margin for the first quarter was 56 basis points, an increase of 4 basis points. I'd like to spend a minute on the actions taken in the UK which Brian discussed earlier. The first quarter was a very difficult quarter and the COVID pandemic had a greater impact on our UK operations than the rest of our European operations. Our teams have adapted to a changing operating environment in the wake of COVID-19. We saw increased demand prior to the lockdown with material reductions after the state home orders were imposed. Volumes have remained steady, however below pre-pandemic levels. In our UK business, we identified an opportunity to accelerate our transition to digital. Our investment in Echo and our digital capabilities, but the strong growth in our online business moved quickly to increase capacity. Revenues from our Echo business grew over 300% from pre-pandemic levels and continue on a strong growth trajectory. Our investment in digital health care strategy in the UK positions us to benefit from the movement of patients to a digital environment. However, given the severity of the COVID impact in the uncertain outlook, we are accelerating actions in our UK business. During the quarter, we announced restructuring actions in the UK to adapt to the difficult and evolving operating environment in the wake of COVID and to continue to better position the business for future profitability. As a result, we took incremental charges in the quarter, which include further rationalization of our footprint in the UK, along with additional cost optimization efforts. Moving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions, we're encouraged to see improved patient mobility and procedure starting to return versus what we saw at the onset of the pandemic. For example, according to IQVIA, April in person primary care visits were down nearly 70% and it improved to approximately 10% to 15% declines as of late June. Revenues were $1.8 billion for the quarter, which were down 5%, driven by the pandemics impact on volume in our primary care business, partially offset by growth in the extended care business. First quarter revenues including increased volumes of personal protective equipment. First quarter adjusted operating profit decreased 22% to $124 million, driven by lower demand in the primary care business, in part due to temporary closures of physician offices across the US, as a result of shelter-in-place guidelines. Segment adjusted operating margin for the first quarter was 689 basis points, a decrease of 147 basis points driven primarily by customer and product mix. In finishing our business review with Other, revenues were $2.6 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 13% year-over-year. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues decreased 10%, driven by lower volumes in the Canadian business, which includes both the exit of an unprofitable customer at the onset of the fiscal year and the negative impact of the pandemic. First quarter adjusted operating profit was $137 million, down 50% on both the reported and FX adjusted basis, driven primarily by the lapping of the prior year contribution of $108 million from the company's investment in Change Healthcare, along with the negative impact in pandemic on the businesses within Other. Excluding the prior-year contribution from Change, Other was down approximately 18% year-over-year. And moving to Corporate, McKesson reported $178 million in adjusted corporate expenses in the quarter, an increase of 30% year-over-year, which was primarily driven by the lapping of a prior year one-time gain from investment activities and an increase in opioid litigation cost compared to the prior year. Excluding the prior year one-time benefit, corporate expenses increased approximately 10% year-over-year. For the first quarter, we reported net opioid related litigation expenses of $43 million. Now on to cash, which can be found on slide 10. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.9 billion. During the quarter, we had negative free cash flow of $1.2 billion. Our working capital metrics and resulting free cash flow will vary from quarter-to-quarter, impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of a quarter. The dynamics of the current operating environment resulting from the effects of COVID-19 has introduced further volatility in our cash flow. However, improving volumes and strong working capital fundamentals give us confidence we will continue to generate solid free cash flow. Investment in growth opportunities remains a key priority for McKesson and during the quarter, we made $170 million of capital expenditures. We continue to focus on internal investments in areas such as technology and our strategic growth initiatives. We return cash to our shareholders through the payment of $74 million in dividends. We have $1.5 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization and we continue to expect weighted shares outstanding in the range of $161 million to $163 million. We also continue to anticipate free cash flow in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion for fiscal 2021. Let me transition now and talk about our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2021. We continue to believe we are well positioned in the markets we compete with a clear strategy in a differentiated set of assets and capabilities. We remain confident in our long-term prospects, which are rooted in the important role we play in the healthcare supply chain. In May, we outlined two key macro assumptions which I am reiterating today. First, we did not assume a second wave of COVID-19 which would lead to shelter-at-home and economic lockdowns. And second, we do not assume any systemic customer insolvency events. Similar to my comments in May, I'd reiterate that one certainty is the defense will occur in the coming days and weeks that could cause these underlying assumptions to change from what we know today. As you think about our outlook, I'd highlight the strong relationship of our performance with two key factors. First, the macroeconomic environment and the intersection of prescription volumes in patient behavior. And second, our ability to continue to execute our strategy, with a disciplined approach to invest and position ourselves for growth in the areas of specialty, oncology and biopharma services. This remains a dynamic environment and while the situation has undoubtedly improved, the reality remains that the virus is not completely under control with many areas seeing increased positive cases in hospitalizations. The impact of the pandemic is highly fluid and likely to continue evolving over the coming weeks and months. We continue to expect the trajectory of the recovery to quarterly closely to the level of mobility of patients, prescription transaction volumes and the demand for healthcare interactions with primary care physicians, oncologists and elective procedure levels. We continue to believe the first quarter will be the most severely impacted and we expect to see sequential revenue and adjusted operating profit improvement over the balance of the fiscal year. However, we do not believe the recovery in our business will be linear. Based on what we've observed in the past 75-days, we believe that a full recovery may take longer than originally contemplated. However, we continue to expect growth in the second half of the year as compared to the prior year. Let me provide a few details of our outlook. As a result of earlier recovery in volumes versus original expectations, we now anticipate consolidated revenues to increase on the high end with the previously provided range of 2% to 4% growth for fiscal 2021. We now expect the consolidated adjusted operating profit will decline between 1% and 4% for the full-year, when you exclude the results of Change Healthcare from the prior year and this is up from our original guidance, the decline between 5% and 8%. And as I mentioned earlier, we anticipate enterprise adjusted operating profit to grow sequentially throughout fiscal 2021 and continue to expect growth in the second half of the fiscal year on a year-over-year basis. Let me talk a little bit about the segments. Given the earlier than anticipated recovery of the provider solutions business in the quarter and improved outlook for fiscal 2021, we now expect US Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions full-year segment adjusted operating profit to be in the range of down 2% to up 2% compared to prior year. In the second half of our fiscal year, we continue to expect adjusted operating profit of flat to 3% growth compared to the prior year. In Europe, our first quarter segment results were above expectations, driven by increased cost mitigation activities in response to the pandemic. As a result of this first quarter performance and modest improvement in the aggregate recovery timeline across Europe, we now expect European segment revenues to be in the range of down 3% to up 1% compared to prior year. Additionally, we now expect segment adjusted operating profit to decline between 4% and 9% for fiscal 2021. The operating environment remains challenging in many markets due to the earlier recovery in the flattening of the recovery curve, we now expect second half adjusted operating profit to decline between 4% and 6% in Europe. Turning to our Medical-Surgical Segment. As discussed in my opening remarks, we began to see volume improvements in the primary care business in the month of June. As a result of the pace of the recovery within primary care in the segment and higher volumes within extended care, we are updating our outlook for the segment. We now expect fiscal 2021 segment revenue to increase between 8% and 12% and segment adjusted operating profit in the range of down 3% to an increase of 3%. We continue to expect growth in the second half of the fiscal year, compared to the prior year and now project to be between 10% and 15%. Turning to Other, as a result of return to more normalized volumes in the Canadian business in the back half of June, we now anticipate segment revenues to decline between 5% and 10% for fiscal 2021. Excluding the impact of Change Healthcare, we continue to expect greater than 10% growth in the second half of the fiscal year when compared to the prior year. Within our corporate segment for fiscal 2021, we now anticipate that opioid-related costs will approximately be $160 million. Based on higher opioid-related costs and increased investment in the business, including technology versus our original outlook we now anticipate corporate expenses to be in the range of $690 million to $740 million. We have a solid balance sheet, healthy cash generation and financial flexibility, which underpins our investment grade credit rating. These dynamics form the foundation for a balanced approach to capital deployment, investing in growth areas aligned to our strategy and returning cash to our shareholders. Based on our solid first quarter results, our view of the macro environment and our updated outlook on transaction volumes across the business we are raising the full year fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $14.70 to $15.50 per diluted share from our previous outlook of $13.95 to $14.75 per diluted share. In closing, we're pleased with the results of our fiscal first quarter and we're proud of how we responded to a dynamic environment, supporting our customers despite the uncertainties that were brought on by this pandemic. Our disciplined execution delivered solid results, combined with our strong balance sheet and financial position, we're well positioned to deliver growth in the second half of the year as compared to the prior year. The external environment continues to present many unknowns, but our businesses have continued to be resilient with strong execution and stable fundamentals. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time I ask that you limit yourself to just one question to allow others an opportunity to participate. Turn over to the operator.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird.
Eric Coldwell: Hey, thanks very much. Congrats on navigating the tough environment. The question is pretty simple, it's on PPE. I'm curious if you can give us a sense on how much PPE demand help the growth or offset the challenges in Medical-Surgical. And then longer-term, do you see opportunities in PPE that expand beyond your core customer base, other industries that might be a need of these products and whether you have an interest in addressing that as well? Thanks.
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Eric. I mean the -- probably goes without saying the demand for PPE is up significantly whether you're talking about core healthcare markets or schools or workplaces. We certainly see that increased demand for PPE and that reflects, that does reflect in the Medical Group's results for the quarter. Our priority internally has been and continues to be to make sure we support the frontline caregivers and that we get the necessary PPE to them. And quite honestly, some of these customer segments historically didn't have a lot of demand for some of the products like N95 mask, it just wasn't necessary in the way they were in their businesses, that's the way they ran their businesses, that's obviously changed. And so we're working hard to source. Our sourcing teams are very active with various partners. Manufacturers around the world really to continue to make sure we can meet the needs of those healthcare customers. And we would not be looking to expand into industrial or other lines until we felt confident we could meet the core needs of the healthcare -- our healthcare customers today.
Britt Vitalone: Eric, I guess what I would add to that. You probably noticed that in addition to the strong volumes we saw in primary care in June, PPE contributed to that, and that was part of the reason why we increased our revenue guide for the year. If you recall, our original guidance for the medical segment was revenue to be down 3% to 8% year-over-year. We've now upped that to 8% to 12% growth and PPE was a part of that in addition to the strong primary care volumes that we saw at the back half of June.
Holly Weiss: Next question?
Operator: And next will be Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company.
Charles Rhyee: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. You guys noted a strong recovery in June. Maybe you can give us a sense on how July has looked then? And has volumes remained at the June levels? Or are you continuing to see a further acceleration? Particularly as we've seen more surges here in states like Texas, California and Florida, because it sounds like you're saying you're not assuming a second wave. So is that kind of the assumption that unlike the beginning of the pandemic where everything kind of shut down, you're assuming that these states largely stay open, which kind of changes how volume should be affected? Thanks.
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Charles. Certainly, April was a very soft month. I think we signaled that when we talked about our guidance for the year. April and May more or less tracked to the assumptions that we had laid out as we saw the recovery progressing. That held up early part of June, and then it really accelerated, and it's pretty correlated to, if you look at the timing of when states kind of relax their restrictions on movement and local economy, markets got opened back up and people got back to the business of healthcare. And we saw those volumes strengthen for us really through the conclusion of our June quarter. June ended right prior to the 4th of July holiday. So there's always nuances around timing of events like that. I think as we think about going forward, you're exactly right, we are not -- we have not built this plan around a presumption of a second lockdown, so to speak. We think economies will continue to stay open. I do think if you reflect on what's happened in Texas and Florida and Arizona and what's occurring now in other states as those states start to bend their curves downward, that's where we get to this idea. I think the word we used was linear. We don't think it's going to be steady progression. I mean based on states and cities and municipalities and how the virus accelerates or decelerates, we'll see some variability. But we are not anticipating a return to shelter in place, like we saw in the March time frame.
Holly Weiss: Next question?
Operator: And next will be Michael Cherny with Bank of America Securities.
Michael Cherny: Good morning and congratulations on the strong results. I want to dive in a little bit to the pharma segment. You had a comment in your release about the strength in national accounts, you talked about that going forward. Can you may be bifurcate a little bit in terms of the pacing of recovery you're seeing, the differences you're seeing broadly between those national accounts versus some of the independent pharmacies that you've traditionally served and how those should dovetail going forward given the various different pacings of openings across the country?
Brian Tyler: Sure. I would say as a general characterization, the pacing has been pretty consistent retail national account versus independent. Meaning the macro trend of when we saw volume soften in April, start to recover in May, continue to bounce back in June. I think those trend lines are largely consistent. A national chain probably has a little less exposure to a particular state or community that might be experiencing a better or worse COVID progression. So obviously, there's some almost built in risk mitigation from being a national chain. But by and large, I think the independents have held up pretty well. We have -- we stay obviously in close contact with them. We see many of, for example, our Health Marts, participating in some of the testing and I think people reflect now more than ever, the important role of community care and pharmacists as a point of community care in the recovery. So I don't think there's anything I would draw other than that.
Britt Vitalone: And I think it goes without saying that national accounts just based on their size, have a greater proportion of the segment. And I don't think you should take that as one part of the segment grew faster than the other. I think it's just given the proportion that national accounts make up within that segment, they had a bigger impact.
Holly Weiss: Next question?
Operator: And next will be Steven Valiquette with Barclays.
Steven Valiquette: Great, thanks. Good morning, Brian and Britt. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, if you go back about three months ago, there was a lot of chatter in the US prescription marketplace about mail order Rx taking share from retail Rx. I guess, I'm curious, just based on reorder patterns that you might be seeing as the June quarter progressed and into July. Are there any notable trends from your own book of business just on the strength of reorders in the mail order channel versus retail channel? Thanks.
Brian Tyler: Thank you for the question, Steven. I mean we obviously went early in the lockdown period and payers and health plans started relaxing some of their -- or changing some of their policies. There was an uptick in mail order. If you actually look at the trend lines for mail order and retail, though, after that sort of initial -- just take that initial period out, they actually are tracking pretty consistently. So we don't -- there -- one week, you can get a swing one way or the other. But if you looked over a period of a couple of months, they're actually tracking, would say, and kind of in lockstep. So I don't see anything systemic in terms of the way the market is going to change because of this.
Holly Weiss: Next question?
Operator: The next will be from Eric Percher with Nephron Research.
Eric Percher: Thank you. A question on the specialty business. I think you mentioned 70% volumes at one point in oncology. Certainly, the volumes don't look -- or your US. pharma volumes don't look like you saw that type of impact. Is it safe to assume that, that was visits and that administration has remained much more stable? And then any commentary on the non-oncology would be appreciated.
Britt Vitalone: Eric, let me start, and then Brian can add. Just to clarify, my comments were really related to visits. And so what we saw at the beginning of the quarter right after the pandemic is that visits ticked down to about that 70% level. And we saw pretty steady growth throughout the quarter to roughly the 95% at the end of the quarter that I referenced. And we also saw an increase in telemedicine visits, which I think helped the practices from an efficiency standpoint as well. So a comment, just to clarify, was really based on visits.
Brian Tyler: The only thing I would add to that is, obviously, we had a lot of tremendous insight into oncology. We're in a lot of other specialties. And it's one of the, I guess, nuances to the environment we're in right now is that each specialty, just like each of our market segments has got a bit of their own recovery curve [ph] and timing just kind of dependent on what's the nature of the disease, what's the nature of the therapies, what's the interaction with physicians, what's the applicability of telehealth versus not. So we really watch this by each of the various disease states.
Holly Weiss: Next question?
Operator: Next will be Glen Santangelo with Guggenheim.
Glen Santangelo: Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. I just had two quick financial ones. Britt, you raised the adjusted EPS number by $0.75 at the midpoint. I just want to be clear that this doesn't include any of the gain from the insurance proceeds or the one-time benefit that sounds like it's coming in 2Q? And then secondly, you raised operating profit and your EPS outlook, but could you may be discuss the impact on cash flows? Because, obviously, we had the negative timing thing in 1Q in maintaining the free cash flow guidance for the year, despite raising the operating profit and it seems like you have no repo in the guidance. I just want to make sure I have all those pieces clear. Thanks.
Britt Vitalone: Sure. Thanks for the questions. Let me try to unpack those for you. As it relates to the guide, first, as it relates to the insurance proceeds, as I mentioned, those are GAAP only. So those are not included in our adjusted earnings. As it relates to the comments that I made around tax, I would just refer you that our full year expectation on the tax rate is still within 18% to 20%. What I was trying to do is to give a little bit more visibility into the timing that we expect to see throughout the year. So, I think -- and as you think about cash flow, it's early. It's first quarter of the year. We're trending as we had assumed or roughly as we assumed in the first quarter. Our cash flow, as I mentioned in my comments, has historically varied from quarter-to-quarter, but I think the COVID environment places additional volatility on that. And so our -- as we think about this throughout the rest of the year as we get more visibility into patterns and working capital demands, we'll certainly provide updates as appropriate. But I wouldn't read anything into that. It's early from a -- for a -- to give a full year update on the cash flow guide.
Holly Weiss: Next question?
Operator: Next will be Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research.
Stephen Baxter: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. I was hoping you could touch on trends within the generics market a little bit. As we entered this COVID period, there are some concerns around API and potential drug shortages. So I guess, what, if anything, did you end up seeing on that front? And then kind of in line with that, it looks to us, at least the generic depletion trends moderated a bit in the quarter. Is that consistent with McKesson's experience? And then if so, do you have a view on what's driving that moderation and how sustainable it is? Thanks.
Brian Tyler: So, I'll start and let Britt add on, if he'd like. I mean, I think that the generic market has continued to perform in a way consistent with the past several quarters. As you know, we focus more on the spread, the difference between the sell price and the acquisition price, and we don't tend to comment on generic deflation too much. But I would continue to characterize that market as stable and is consistent with what we've seen over past quarters. I think it's -- I think the disruptions to generic supply from COVID have been well-managed and quite minimal and may not even be attributable to COVID per se. We do have a dedicated and focused team that we stood up at the outset of this pandemic to work closely with suppliers, not just existing suppliers, but other suppliers around the globe to forecast and track our views of inventory and inventory availability. But I would say thus far through certainly our first quarter, the supply situation has been well managed.
Holly Weiss: Next question?
Operator: Next will be Lisa Gill with JP Morgan.
Lisa Gill: Thanks very much. Good morning. I just wanted to go back to a comment, Britt, that you made around the macro-economic environment. I'm just curious, what do you currently have built into your expectations? I know that there's been some concern around layoffs and them staying permanent. But yet, as we look at membership across the managed care companies coming in a little bit better than expectations. I'm just curious as to what your thoughts are, obviously, going into the guidance. And then, as we think about that macro environment and go back to the last financial downturn, if I remember correctly, when we think about pharmaceutical utilization, it was pretty inelastic, right, had a little bit of an impact, but not very material. So I just -- I want to better understand what's in the guidance.
Britt Vitalone: Sure. Good morning, Lisa. Thanks for that question. I'll just refer you back to some comments that I made on the May call. And we track unemployment levels very closely. We track the solvency of our customers very closely, work very closely with them to make sure that they have all the resources that they need. What I said in May would still hold. We expect that the peak unemployment levels will be in the second calendar quarter. We still expect that to be the case. Obviously, unemployment has been stubborn for the last 18, 19 weeks, but we do believe that it will peak in this second calendar quarter. And so I think, to your second question, I think you're right. I think we do believe that prescription transaction volumes will be not as affected as the overall economy will be. And that's given us the confidence to really raise our revenue guide within that segment for the full year.
Holly Weiss: Next question?
Operator: Next will be Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser: Yes. Hi, good morning. So distribution of COVID vaccine captured headlines last week, and we've been getting questions from investors on what could the distribution infrastructure looks like. So just wondering how do you envision distribution of COVID vaccine when available in the market? Where would it be administrated? And what role would McKesson have?
Britt Vitalone: Thank you, Ricky. It's early days, I think, to forecast, A, when the vaccine will be available, which manufacturer, it might be available from and what the best method of distribution for that vaccine will be. You're as aware as I am, there's over 100 vaccines close to 150 in development. There's probably 10 to 20 at the front end of that funnel. We continue to work closely and are in discussions with all of those -- all of the manufacturers around these vaccines. Our company has a great capability in this area. We administer the vaccines for children's program today. We obviously have large channels in the medical business and in the pharmaceutical business that support community providers who administer these vaccines, and in over a decade ago, when our nation was dealing with H1N1, we continue -- it's a proud moment in McKesson's history of the role we were able to play in managing that vaccine solution. So, I think we have terrific capabilities. We're in active dialogue with everybody. Our first and foremost goal will be to do whatever we can do to help accelerate getting a vaccine to market. That's the most important thing we can do and what we're focused on right now.
Holly Weiss: Next question?
Operator: Next will be Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Jones: Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess, maybe just to follow-on to that. There seems to be a view that flu vaccines will be much higher utilized this year than in a normal year. So just curious how you're thinking about that and what's factored into guidance? And then -- and Brian, you made a comment during the prepared remarks around lab testing and the opportunity that McKesson is playing in just the COVID testing process. I was curious also there, if you could maybe just expand a little bit about how big that opportunity is and what's factored into the guidance. Thanks.
Brian Tyler: Sure. Thanks, Robert. So I'll start, I guess, just a few comments on flu. I mean, flu is a component of our medical business. I wouldn't overemphasize the role of flu vaccine there. Every flu season tends to be its own season, depending on the severity of the strand, depending on the effectiveness of the vaccination. So we've lived through lots of different kinds of flu seasons, strong ones and weak ones. And I think our best thinking at this point is this -- it would be a typical or average flu season. Now, it's still quite early to make that call with any specific insight into how flu may interact with COVID and patient perception. So it's something we'll continue to monitor and watch. And then relative to the comments about lab, I mean we -- by virtue of our position in the alternate care markets and supporting nursing homes and supporting physician offices. We just have great reach into the community. And so as the need for these -- this testing moves into the community-based setting, we're well positioned to take advantage of that.
Britt Vitalone: Maybe just to build on Brian's comment. The flu vaccine itself within our medical business is a component of pharmaceutical distribution within that segment. And it's not -- the vaccine itself is not material to the segment. And as Brian mentioned, we've thought about this as more of a typical flu season that we've seen over the last several years. Now if it's a little bit greater than it has been in prior years again, the vaccine distribution itself is not material to the segment.
Holly Weiss: Operator, we have time for one more question.
Operator: Certainly, that question will come from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.
George Hill: Hey, good morning, guys and thanks for squeezing me in. I guess nobody's asked the opioid question. I was a little surprised to see opioid litigation expenses up year-over-year. I guess, just do you guys feel like any project, any progress has been made on the opioid litigation front over the last quarter? Kind of any update in that process would be helpful. Thank you.
Brian Tyler: Thanks, George. I'll take this one. And I really don't have any kind of material update. We do continue to be engaged in discussions with attorneys, generals and others. We do remain hopeful that broad resolution can be achieved. We think it's important that if there's a path to accelerate relief efforts for people and the communities impacted that we find a way to take that path. You can imagine the amount of focus on COVID-19 over the past quarter, but we do continue the dialogue, we do continue to be optimistic that a broad resolution could be reached, and we do continue to prepare our defense in the event that it can't be. And that's about all I can add to that. Well, thank you, everyone, for your questions, and thank you for joining us on the call. Alyssa, thank you for helping us facilitate this call. I want to conclude my remarks today by just thanking all the frontline workers across the world who are tirelessly day in and day out working to keep us healthy and safe. And I certainly want to recognize the outstanding performance of our 80,000 employees, especially their commitment to helping their communities and to helping each other in this time of need. We wish you and your families good health and wellness. I look forward to the day we can be together. Thank you all.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.

===== 2020 Q4  (2020-05-20 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to McKesson's Q4 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Holly Weiss. Please go ahead.
Holly Weiss: Thank you, Lashana. Good morning and welcome everyone to McKesson's fourth quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, and Britt Vitalone, our will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, such as forecast about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's press release and our slide presentation and to the Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. During this call we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Additional information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results is included in today’s release and presentation slides, which are available on our website at investor.meckesson.com. With that let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Holly, and good morning, everybody. Appreciate you being with us on the call today. I sincerely hope that you and your families and your communities are staying healthy and safe as we navigate through these really extraordinary times. Today, we reported a strong finish to our fiscal 2020 with the trends we saw in the fourth quarter prior to the COVID-19 pandemic reflecting a continuation of the momentum we experienced coming into and really throughout our fiscal year.  Throughout McKesson's 187-year history, we've demonstrated time and time again our ability to adapt and swiftly respond to the evolving needs of our customers, particularly in trying times and the resiliency in the long-term strength of our business model. Today, my remarks will echo similar themes. I want to walk you through McKesson's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the essential role we play in the healthcare supply chain, the progress we've made this year against our strategic priorities, and our FY '20 results, including the impact COVID-19 had on our fiscal fourth quarter. I also want to talk about why I'm confident that McKesson remains well positioned now and especially over the longer term. Before I begin, I want to acknowledge and really sincerely thank all of those who are working so tirelessly to keep us healthy and safe during this crisis, including our customers and all frontline healthcare professionals, nurses, physicians, first responders literally around the world. Thank you to each and every one of our 80,000 McKesson associates for their passion, their energy, in many cases, courage these past several months, working around the clock to maintain McKesson's operations and support our customers and frontline caregivers during these challenging times. I want to particularly recognize our colleagues, who are on our front lines, like those in our distribution centers, in our pharmacies in Canada and Europe, supporting community practices and our transportation professionals, your commitment to making it happen, going the extra mile for our customers and rallying around one another in these times, it's -- well, it's just what makes McKesson's culture so special that makes me incredibly proud to be part of team McKesson. As one of the largest healthcare companies in the world we have, and we will continue to play an essential role in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. Our response has been guided by the key principles of protecting health and safety for the healthcare supply chain, for our customers and for our employees and the communities in which we all live. Early on, we enacted our business continuity and disaster recovery plans across the organization in order to maintain high-functioning operations around the globe. We assembled a critical care drug task force comprised of our sourcing specialists and individuals with clinical backgrounds in health systems/pharmacy to review guidelines and protocols and to forecast changing pharmaceutical and medical product demand. This task force in conjunction with guidance from our government partners is working to predict, allocate, and extend supply availability to serve the rapidly changing needs of our customers. In addition, our ClarusONE and our global sourcing teams in London are working closely with manufacturers to understand their plans and to create new capacity or scale-up production, so that we can be prepared to swiftly react as a supply chain in the coming weeks, months, and years ahead. McKesson is partnering with government agencies at the federal, state, and local level along with other along with other industry leaders to creatively solve for the most complex and pressing issues this crisis presents. As demand surges for personal protective equipment, or PPE, McKesson is doing everything within our power to identify new sources, manufacturers, and markets for these critically needed products. We are very proud of our partnership with Walmart to produce and deliver medical gowns to the U.S. Our two companies have collaborated in an entirely new way by bringing expert teams together and moving with remarkable speed, which has led to two million additional medical gowns in our country supply to-date, and we expect roughly 10 million will be added by the end of June. In Europe and Canada, our retail pharmacies have remained open, providing the essential community-based care that our customers rely on. We implemented several changes in our retail pharmacies to ensure our customers feel comfortable and safe, including limiting the number of customers in stores, installing protective shields at pharmacy counters, dedicating shopping times for seniors and for first responders, and regularly disinfecting all high-touch areas. We're also expanding our pharmacy services to include virtual health offerings, home delivery in certain markets, and increased online pharmacy capabilities. We've undertaken multiple measures to protect and promote the well-being of our employees. These include comprehensive sanitation protocols for our distribution centers and office facilities, work-from-home technology for our office-based employee, enhanced medical benefits including telemedicine and wellness offerings and emergency paid sick leaves. Some of our very first actions were to recognize the stress that this situation would put on our front-line workers and our communities, so we made special payments to reward the hard work of our associates on the front line and to bring some comfort and sense of calm to their families. We increased funding to our Take Care of Our Own Fund to help with expenses such as child care, groceries, housing, and utilities. And we increased our foundation funding to support our communities in their time of great need, including donations to support local food banks in communities where McKesson distribution centers are located around the U.S. Our approach to address the pandemic underscores our value system and how we carry out our vision to improve care in every setting, one product, one partner, one patient at a time. Turning now to our financial performance. We're going to review our fiscal 2020 results, our fiscal 2021 outlook, and why we're so confident in McKesson's long-term future, despite the near-term uncertainties that are really facing everyone. In fiscal 2020, McKesson delivered strong revenue and adjusted operating profit growth across the business. Our fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings per diluted share result of $14.95, which was up 10% versus the prior year reflects continuing momentum and transformation within our business. Coming into the CEO role a little over a year ago, I focused the organization around three strategic priorities, which I shared during our analyst meeting in December. I'd remind you, these priorities were growing our core U.S. pharma business, investing in the areas where we have differentiated capability and growth prospects and simplifying the business and better aligning the organization. I'm extremely pleased with the meaningful progress we made in executing against these strategic priorities in fiscal 2020. In our U.S. Pharmaceutical Specialty and Solutions segment, we finished the year with the highest level of adjusted operating profit growth in our last four fiscal years. And we again this year successfully renewed large customers while being disciplined in our approach to the market, most recently, having been selected by the VA to continue to serve as their prime pharmaceutical vendor. We believe our strong value proposition and superior customer service quality are foundational to this success. Our cost and working capital efficiencies underpin this growth and further fuel the strategic investments we're making in the business. We view our investments in data and analytics as investments in foundational capability, leveraging our scale to deliver greater value for our customers. We're also making investments into areas where we believe we have differentiated capability and opportunity for growth. In alignment with our strategic growth initiatives, we're expanding our manufacturer value proposition to drive more innovation, better patient outcome, and additional uptake for our manufacturer partners. We're harnessing our decades of experience in patient access and adherence programs and combining it with the connectivity and reach of CoverMyMeds within our MRxTS business to deliver new capabilities at accelerated speed. And we continue to prioritize specialty as a key area of future growth of investments. We have been building and investing in our portfolio of differentiated specialty assets for more than a decade, which gives us great expertise in areas like oncology. Our third strategic priority centered around simplifying the business and aligning the organization. We are becoming a more focused, more aligned and more agile company, a foundation that served us well during our COVID-19 pandemic response. In fiscal 2020, we transformed our operating model through initiatives like our spin smart program and centralizing functional services across North America and in Europe. Evidence of our success in rationalizing costs and streamlining back-office functions is also reflected in our positive European segment fiscal 2020 results. Our Canadian business successfully streamlined its organization structure to better serve our retail and wholesale operations customers. This strategic change, combined with the continued execution of actions taken in the prior year, translated into good profit growth for the Canadian business this year. We also invested a significant amount of time in our culture transformation and leveraged our corporate headquarters relocation to Texas to strengthen our management team. Five new members have joined my management team this year, and I could not new be more pleased with how quickly the team has united together to execute our strategic and cultural priorities. One of the most visible accomplishments we made in fiscal 2020 towards simplifying the business was the completion of our exit of Change Healthcare. This is a significant milestone in our company's history that was nearly four years in the making, and we're pleased to deliver on our commitment to create shareholder value through a tax-efficient exit. Let me turn now to the trends that we're currently seeing on our business and how and how we're planning ahead for fiscal 2021 in light of these near-term macro uncertainties. I'll discuss these trends really in kind of more real-time granularity than we typically would and then Britt will further elaborate on my comments. We really want to help you understand how the rapidly evolving environment impacted not just our FY 2020 results, but also our FY 2021 outlook. I'll start in the U.S. and Specialty Solutions segment. We saw increased demand in pharmaceutical sales during the month of March as consumers prepared for an extended stay-at-home. In turn, pharmaceutical sales declined below pre-pandemic levels in April, coinciding with the start of our fiscal year. More pronounced was the decline in specialty provider volumes, primarily in the non-oncology markets. In Oncology, as evidenced by U.S. oncology practices, despite a decline in routine office visits such as consults and follow-ups, we are seeing relative signs of stability in oncology volumes as patients remain on their treatment regimens. In our Medical business, our alternate site customers are facing significant headwinds, with providers and surgery centers seeing sharp declines in office visits due to shelter-in-place guidelines that have taken effect. In our Technology, our MRxTS business, we're seeing lower prior authorization volume as a result of provider office closures and relaxed and sometimes extended requirements from payers. And in Canada and Europe, our retail pharmacy operations are navigating how to adapt to changing consumer needs as retail traffic is impacted by social distancing guidelines. While it is still early in the quarter, we are currently seeing positive indicators and encouraging signs across all of our businesses that activities are beginning to pick up in the communities where shelter-in-place guidelines are being relaxed. With this as our environmental backdrop, we carefully and thoughtfully constructed our fiscal 2021 outlook based on what we know today. Our fiscal 2021 outlook of $13.95 to $14.75 of adjusted earnings per diluted share factors in several macroeconomic and business-specific detailed assumptions. Britt is going to take you through the detailed assumptions of our outlook, but let me comment on why we remain confident now more than ever in McKesson's future. We have proven our resiliency and natural ability to lead during times of crisis such as H1N1, SARS, recession of 2008-2009. I think the lessons we've learned and the expertise we've gained continue to serve us well. We operate from a position of financial strength. Our strong balance sheet, access to capital markets, strong credit ratings provide us great financial flexibility. Our fiscal 2020 results reinforce the operational momentum we're generating in our business and we have repeatedly demonstrated our willingness and commitment to make the right, not always easy, but right decision is the best position of the business for a long-term growth. Despite the near-term challenges, we remain focused on executing against our priorities and investing in our strategic growth initiatives. The positive energy, dedication, commitment and togetherness of team McKesson is unmatched, and I do believe our future is bright. Again, thank you for your time, and let me now turn it over to Britt.
Britt Vitalone: Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Our fiscal fourth fiscal fourth quarter was certainly very different quarter than we were expecting when we last spoke during our third quarter earnings call. The COVID-19 health crisis has impacted the way our employees, customers, partners and communities live and work. We could not be prouder of how our teams across the world have responded. In this new environment, our team supported our employees, customers, patients and communities and demonstrated the resiliency and strength of our business with solid financial performance during these challenging times. Let me start by reaffirming that the fundamentals of McKesson's business are solid. Our strategy is clear, and the prospects for the business remain unchanged and promising. Despite the challenges and uncertainties of the current environment, our businesses continue to play a leading role in the health care supply chain. Our focus, execution and financial discipline remain intact. Today, I'll provide you with more granularity than I typically do to help you understand our view on recent trends and how our business is performing in this uncertain and rapidly evolving environment. I have three primary goals for today's call. First, to provide an update on our fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 results, including the estimated impacts from COVID-19. Second, to provide an overview of the recent trends we are seeing. And third, to provide a detailed fiscal 2021 outlook. Many companies have withdrawn and not provided guidance. However, given the uncertainties in the environment and the wide disparity across analyst models, we felt it was important to provide our assumptions and views on the upcoming fiscal year. I will address our guidance in more detail later in my prepared remarks. However, I'd like to provide a bit of framing as it relates to fiscal 2021. The guidance we are providing today assumes that the first half of fiscal 2021 will be challenging with the most severe fiscal 2021 will be challenging with the most severe impacts from COVID-19 occurring during our fiscal first quarter ending June 30. We anticipate that we begin to see gradual improvement in our fiscal second quarter ending September 30 with continued improvement in our results over the second half of our fiscal year. Let me state at the beginning of this call. We expect the business will deliver growth in adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per diluted share in the second half of the fiscal year, as compared to 2020 when setting aside the fiscal 2020 contribution from our prior equity stake in Change Healthcare. Let's turn now to a review of our fiscal 2020 results. McKesson posted a solid close to fiscal 2020 with full year adjusted earnings per diluted share of $14.95. This result was 10% above fiscal 2019 and included a return to adjusted operating profit growth in all reportable cycles. Additionally, we're pleased to have completed the successful exit of our investment in Change Healthcare during the quarter through a tax-efficient split off transaction. Our exit resulted in a pre and post-tax gain of $414 million, which impacted our GAAP-only results in the quarter. With the split-off complete, we are well positioned to move forward with increased focus against our strategic growth initiatives. Our balance sheet remains solid, which underpins our investment grade credit rating. Our financial position provides us the flexibility necessary to navigate current market uncertainty and future growth opportunities. On our February 4 third quarter earnings call, I discussed momentum building across the business. This momentum continued to build through mid-March. On March 11, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Shortly after, our businesses experienced increased demand and consumer behavior patterns began to change, as the virus continued to spread. Pharmaceutical distribution volumes in the U.S., Europe and Canada, increased, as people stocked up on medications and personal protective equipment. This incremental demand provided a net tailwind to our fourth quarter revenue results. I want to take a moment to provide the estimated impact of COVID-19 on our fiscal fourth quarter consolidated results. There's approximately $2 billion of incremental revenue, resulting primarily from higher customer demand for pharmaceuticals. We expect this reverse in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Adjusted gross profit in the quarter was favorably impacted by approximately $65 million, offset by approximately $15 million in variable operating expenses, as a result of these incremental volumes. We also had approximately $45 million of one-time adjusted operating expenses in the quarter, including investments in our frontline employees, higher expenses to support a remote workforce and charitable contributions to support our communities. In summary, the impact of COVID-19 had a nominal effect on our fourth quarter adjusted earnings results, as the previously mentioned impacts largely offset. Let's transition now to a discussion of our adjusted earnings results for the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $4.27, up 16% in the quarter compared to the prior year, primarily driven by a lower share count in growth in the European Pharmaceutical and U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions businesses, offset by higher corporate expenses, which includes the one-time costs I referenced earlier. Moving to the details of our consolidated results, which can be found on slide four. Consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter increased 12% versus the prior period, principally driven by growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment. As previously mentioned, the estimated impact of COVID-19 was approximately $2 billion of incremental revenue in the quarter. Excluding these incremental sales, consolidated revenues increased approximately 8% year-over-year. Fourth quarter adjusted gross profit was up 7% year-over-year, led by growth in our Medical-Surgical and U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segments. Fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses increased 8% year-over-year, driven by increased investments to support future growth in our oncology and specialty businesses, technology infrastructure and the previously mentioned one-time expenses during the quarter. These incremental one-time and COVID-driven expenses accounted for approximately 3% of the year-over-year increase. Adjusted income from operations was $1 billion for the quarter, an increase of 1% as compared to the prior year. Interest expense was $65 million in the quarter, a decline of 7% compared to the prior year, due to lower commercial paper balances. Our adjusted tax rate was 17.3% for the quarter, mainly driven by our mix of business and discrete tax benefits. Wrapping up our consolidated results. Our fourth quarter diluted weighted average shares were 174 million, a decrease of 9% year-over-year. Our adjusted earnings results includes a $0.07 benefit from our previously mentioned split-off of Change Healthcare, which lowered our shares outstanding by $15.4 million. Next, I'll review our results, which can be Slides 5 through 8, starting with the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment. Revenues were $46.3 billion for the quarter, up 13% and driven by branded pharmaceutical price increases and growth from our large retail national account customers, including incremental volume resulting from COVID-19. These were partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Fourth quarter adjusted operating profit increased 3% to $772 million, driven by continued growth in specialty businesses, partially offset by previously announced investments in the oncology and manufacturer services. Segment adjusted operating profit for the full year increased 6% to $2.7 million and the segment adjusted operating margin for was 146 basis points, a decrease of 4 basis points. Next European Pharmaceutical Solutions, revenues were $7.2 billion for the quarter, an increase of 6% year-over-year. On an FX-adjusted basis, revenues increased 9% driven by growth in the Pharmaceutical Distribution business, including incremental revenue as a result of COVID-19. Fourth quarter adjusted operating profit increased 226% to $75 million. On an FX-adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit increased 239%, driven in part by lower operating expenses as a result of actions previously taken to rationalize our store footprint and streamline back-office functions and the lapping of a prior year inventory charge of approximately $20 million. Segment adjusted operating profit for the full year increased 5% to $231 million, driven primarily by expense rationalization and the previously mentioned prior year item. The segment adjusted operating margin for the full year was 84 basis points, an increase of 4 basis points. Moving now to Medical Surgical, revenues were $2.2 billion for the quarter, up 13%, driven by organic growth led by our primary care business, including higher pharmaceutical and flu test kit volumes. Segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter was down 1% to $170 million, driven primarily by higher expenses in the quarter, which included a provision for bad debt in our primary care business, partially offset by organic growth, principally in our primary care business. Segment adjusted operating margin for the full year increased 12% to $679 million driven by organic growth and the segment adjusted operating margin for the full year was 818 basis points, an increase of 24 basis points. Finishing our business review with Others. Revenues were $2.9 billion for the quarter, up 3% and on an FX-adjusted basis revenues were up 4%, driven primarily by growth in the Canadian and MRxTS businesses. Adjusted operating profit was $242 million for the quarter, down 6% on both the reported and FX-adjusted basis, driven primarily by a lower equity contribution from the company's investment in each healthcare, partially offset by organic growth in the MRxTS business. Other adjusted operating profit for the full year was down 4% to $953 million, driven by the lapping of a $90 million contractual liability reversal related to our investment in Change Healthcare in the prior year, partially offset by higher volumes offset by higher volumes in our MRxTS businesses. Included in Other, adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $253 million for the full year. As a reminder, McKesson will no longer record adjusted equity income for Change Healthcare beginning in fiscal 2021 as a result of the split-off. Moving to Corporate McKesson reported $224 million in adjusted corporate expenses in the quarter, an increase of 25% year-over-year, driven primarily by the previously mentioned onetime expenses and higher opioid-related legal fees. These onetime expenses accounted for approximately 8% of the year-over-year increase. For the full year adjusted corporate expenses were $685 million, an increase of 23% compared to the prior year. The year-over-year increase was a result of planned increases in technology-related investments and an increase of $36 million in opioid related litigation cost to $150 million for fiscal 2020. Turning now to cash, which can be found on slide 10. For the fiscal year, we generated $3.9 billion in free cash flow, which includes $506 million spent on capital expenditures. Fiscal 2020 represented another solid year of cash flow generation, resulting from our continued focus on working capital efficiency, deposit timing impacts in COVID-19. Similar to fiscal 2019, a portion of the fiscal 2020 result was due to favorable timing in our U.S. distribution and European businesses. We also benefited from the previously mentioned demand pull-forward in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which coincided with the end of our fiscal year. We estimate a COVID-19-related benefit of approximately $550 million which is expected to reverse in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $4 billion after paying down approximately $2.4 billion of debt in the fourth quarter, net of issuances, which include a repayment of $2.1 billion of outstanding commercial paper. And in fiscal 2020, we returned $2.2 billion to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. Wrapping up fiscal 2020 results. Our performance in the fourth quarter highlights the resiliency of our business model and the strength of our financial position. Fiscal 2020 marked a return to adjusted operating profit growth across every business, reflecting improved fundamentals and solid execution. Despite recent macroeconomic headwinds, the company is in a solid and stable financial position. With that, let me turn to our fiscal 2021 outlook. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we believe it is important to provide our views of the environment, insight into the trends we are seeing across our businesses and to provide an outlook for fiscal 2021. We believe it's constructive to provide you with our view of the business, including our perspective on the economic uncertainties surrounding the potential impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. We take a long-term approach to our businesses. And although the COVID-19 pandemic presents a near-term headwind, we believe this to be temporary. The underlying fundamentals of our business remains stable and on solid footing as evidenced by our Q4 and full year results for fiscal 2020. I'll start by providing a brief overview of the environment we are operating within. After the initial volume spikes following the March 11 World Health Organization declaration, volumes began to trend lower across our businesses. In April, the landscape continued to evolve quickly in state, provincial and local governments issued shelter in place orders. As a result, physician offices and surgery center sites began to close temporarily, meaning fewer patients going to see their doctors and delays in elective procedures. Throughout April, average weekly volumes in our medical and specialty provider business trailed off up to 50% of pre COVID-19 levels. Oncology visits declined, while volumes in our pharmaceutical distribution and retail businesses experienced greater levels of volatility, as customers adjusted to the environment and government orders and recommendations. From the onset of the pandemic in the U.S., elective therapies showed a sharp decline through April, especially within ophthalmology, where declines were nearly 30% versus calendar 2019. In the first couple of weeks of May, we've seen volumes begin to o stabilize and modestly improve in our pharmaceutical and retail businesses. Volumes in our medical and specialty provider businesses have also begun to stabilize, although well below pre-COVID levels. To this point, the relative shape of the curve is in line with our expectations and confirms our view on the progression of recovery over the course of fiscal 2021. I will note that the guidance we are providing today is based on what we know at this time, and I want to be clear that one certainty is that events will occur in the coming days, weeks and months that will cause these underlying assumptions to change from what we present to you today. Next, I'll provide some framing on a couple of key macro level economic assumptions. We are not assuming that a second wave of the virus returns, leading the shelter to home scenarios precluding patient consumption of healthcare services, supplies and pharmaceutical products. We are not assuming any systemic customer insolvency events. We do assume that unemployment peaks in our fiscal first quarter, and gradually begins to improve across the remaining quarters of our fiscal year. We do assume that physician in an oncology office visits and pharmacy interactions will begin to gradually resume in our fiscal second quarter and continue to improve in the back half of our fiscal year. Our view of the environment, in particular, our largest market, the U.S., assumes that the impact, in particular, to our medical, specialty provider and oncology businesses is more significant and severe in the first quarter and that the shape of the recovery gradually improves each quarter with a return to more normal volumes in our fiscal fourth quarter. With those underlying assumptions in mind, let me turn to our fiscal 2021 guidance. We expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $13.95 to $14.75, which is notably wider than past guidance ranges, given the economic uncertainty inherent in our previously mentioned assumptions. As I discussed in my opening remarks, we anticipate a positive progression of earnings over the course fiscal 2021. We expect Q1 to be sharply down on a year-over-year and sequential basis. We assume modest recovery begins in our fiscal second quarter and that this recovery progresses into the back half of the fiscal year, with the business returning to adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per diluted share, growth in the second half of the fiscal year. For a full list of fiscal 2021 assumptions, please refer to slides 12 through 14 in our supplemental slide presentation. Rather than outlining each assumption, I'll just walk you through the key items, starting with the segments. In the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, we expect 3% to 6% revenue growth, which considers current headwinds in our practice management and provider solutions businesses, as a result of office closures and delays in elective procedures. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be flat to 4% down as compared to the prior year, as a result of the previously mentioned headwinds in our specialty businesses. We expect that the second half adjusted operating profit result will reflect flat to 3% growth, in line with our previously outlined recovery assumptions. In the U.S. market, we anticipate mid-single-digit branded pharmaceutical price increases, largely consistent with our experience in fiscal 2020. As a reminder, approximately 95% of our contracted branded manufacturers are on a fixed fee-for-service rate basis. Moving to the European Solutions segment. We expect revenues to be flat to a 5% decline as compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating profit is also expected to decline between approximately 20% to 25% and driven by anticipated impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on customer behavior patterns over the first half of the fiscal year. We expect that the second half adjusted operating profit results will be flat to 2% growth as compared to the prior year with variability by country as each market opens and begins to return to normal. Transitioning now to Medical Surgical. As we've discussed previously, we have a dynamic and broad portfolio in Medical Surgical. Approximately 60% of our medical-surgical business supports primary care sites, physician offices, ambulatory surgery centers and reference lab locations. These sites of care have been impacted more significantly, as office visits and electric procedures have been canceled or deferred. In constructing our outlook for the Medical-Surgical segment, we developed several potential outcomes to inform the range from the low end to the high end of our estimates. We projected it could take a few quarters for patients to get comfortable returning to physician office sites, and with scheduling an elective procedure, but we do believe this demand will return. Over the past few weeks, we've seen our medical-surgical business begin to stabilize, and we see modest improvements in volumes. We expect the recovery and demand to continue through our fiscal second quarter with further improvements in the second half of our fiscal year. Therefore, we expect a 3% to 8% revenue decline, primarily driven by softened demand in the first half of the fiscal year. As a result of these macro level headwinds. We also expect a 10% to 20% adjusted operating profit decline for the full year. As demand continues to improve, we expect that the second half adjusted operating profit results will grow 5% to 15% as compared to the prior year. For the remaining businesses included in Other, revenue is expected to decline approximately 7% to 12%, driven by expected lower foot traffic in retail stores across Canada in the short-term and lower prior authorization volumes. As a reminder, fiscal 2020 results include our investment in Change Healthcare, which included $253 million in adjusted equity income in fiscal 2020. Excluding the Change Healthcare results in the prior year for comparison purposes, we expect that adjusted operating profit within other will be flat to down 5% for the full year, but it is expected to increase greater than 10% in the second half of the fiscal year as the businesses within other return to normal volumes. Now let me turn to the consolidated view. We expect 2% to 4% revenue growth and adjusted income from operations is anticipated to be a 10% to 15% decline as compared to the prior year. Excluding the results of Change Healthcare from fiscal 2020, we expect that adjusted income from operations will decline 5% to 8% for the full year, but will grow 6% to 10% in the second half of the fiscal year on a year-over-year basis in line with our stated economic recovery assumptions. We expect corporate expenses to be approximately flat compared to prior year, and this assumption reflects opioid-related litigation costs to also be roughly flat year-over-year. We remain focused on our cost savings programs. Our annual pretax gross cost savings target remains approximately $400 million to $500 million, which we are on track to substantially realize for the end of are on track to substantially realize for the end of fiscal 2021. Additionally, we've implemented mitigation efforts in light of the headwinds presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, including an effort continue to reduce controllable spend across all categories. Moving below the line, we expect interest expense in the range of $230 million to $250 million. We expect income attributable to non-controlling interest in the range of $200 million to $220 million. We assume a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 18% to 20%, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter and includes anticipated discrete tax items that we expect to realize during the course of the year. We anticipate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements be a net unfavorable impact of approximately $0.05. And we expect weighted average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2021 to be in approximately $161 million to $163 million. Let me wrap-up our fiscal 2021 outlook with a few comments on cash flow and capital deployment. We expect free cash flow of approximately $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses and includes the pull forward impacts of COVID-19 previously discussed. We will use our cash flow to continue to invest internally in our strategic priorities of oncology and manufacturer services. We anticipate property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses to be in the range of $400 million to $550 million. At McKesson, capital deployment starts with our continued ability to generate healthy operating cash flow. We will continue a disciplined and balanced approach to capital deployment. Our priorities remain clear and consistent. Our demonstrated history of solid cash flow generation provides us flexibility in our capital allocation program. First, we prioritize growth investments in our strategic assets. As an example, in Q4, we continued to invest into our oncology and manufacturer services assets and capabilities to extend our differentiated and leading positions. In fiscal 2021, we will continue to invest in our strategic initiatives to drive further differentiation and position our businesses for long-term growth. The current environment does not impact our desire to invest in M&A opportunities that are on strategy at multiples that offer superior returns on capital and accelerate future growth and cash flow generation. We also remain committed to returning to capital to our shareholders through a modest yet growing dividend and share buybacks. And I would remind you that we currently have $1.5 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We've maintained our investment-grade credit rating, which underpins our financial flexibility and our ability to access the long-term debt in commercial paper markets. We also have access to $4 billion through our revolving credit facility, which has not been drawn upon. At this time, we have no immediate need to access the long-term debt market nor draw upon our revolver to meet near-term liquidity needs. In closing, we are pleased with the results of our fiscal fourth quarter and proud of how we responded to the extraordinary demands brought on by this pandemic. We remain focused on our employees, customers, partners, and communities. While the external environment presents many unknowns, our businesses continue to show resilient and stable fundamentals along with consistent execution. We continue to have a solid balance sheet and healthy cash generation, which underpin our investment grade credit rating, and we'll continue to deploy capital to invest in growth areas aligned to our strategy, aimed at creating balanced returns for our shareholders. Despite the current macroeconomic headwinds, we remain confident in our business and in our ability to create stability and supply chain through the strength of our sourcing and distribution operations. And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I’d ask you to limit yourself to just one question to allow others an opportunity to participate.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Michael Cherny with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Michael Cherny: Good morning. Thank you for all the details. I wanted to just ask a bit of a follow-up clarification, additional question on the pharma EBIT guidance. In particular, you talked about 0% to 3% growth in the second half of the year on an adjusted profit basis, so as you think about the ramping, should we assume that you’ll be exiting fiscal 2021 at a –“normalized run rate?”, and in jumping into fiscal 2022 on what should be the normalized run rate of profit growth for the Pharma segment in particular?
Britt Vitalone: Mike, thanks for that question. I'll start and let Brian add on to that. We're very pleased with our performance in our U.S. Pharma and Specialty Solutions segment in fiscal 2020. We finished the year with full year adjusted operating profit of 6%. We had strong revenue growth throughout the year. And as we talked about, we expect that the first half of the year, we're going to have some more sharp impacts on our Specialty Solutions businesses, which will impact obviously the full year operating profit. As we talked about, we expect that to continue to improve throughout the year. And as we get to the back half of the year, that gradual improvement throughout each quarter will lead us to get back to growth for the second half of the year. And so I think that as you think about this, there's going to be gradual improvement across each quarter. As we get to the end of the year, we're going to be exiting on a growth basis again, and feel good about the prospects from that point forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Jones: Great. Thanks for the question. I guess, maybe, Britt, just to follow-up on that. I mean, coming into fiscal 2020, you guys had thought the U.S. Pharma and Specialty business could grow at 3% to 5%. I'm sure there was a little bit of pull forward in the 4Q. But generally, business performed in line to slightly better than that. I mean, just to follow-up on your previous answer. I mean, is the assumption that the business gets back to those levels as we get through the year, and in particular into 4Q? And then just one housekeeping. I know you mentioned the $45 million of one-time adjusted operating expenses in the fourth quarter. I was curious if that was included, excluded, and then what's the assumption for additional COVID-related costs in 2020 guide? Thanks.
Britt Vitalone: Yeah. Thanks for the question. Let me just step back to your first question. Again, as we talked about, in our U.S. Pharma and Specialty Solutions business, it's a broad business, U.S. Pharma distribution, but also a broad-based specialty set of businesses, which includes our multi-specialty provider businesses, which as we talked about have been more severely impacted in April and early May, and we expect to have a greater impact through the first quarter with just gradual improvement throughout the balance of the year. So as we think about that second half of the year, it's really going to be that continued improvement of not only volumes, but profitability across both of those businesses. And we feel comfortable that getting to a 0% to 3% growth in the balance of the second half, again, with that gradual improvement sets us up well to returning to that 3% to 5% as we go forward. We won't recover all of the volumes this year. We'll recover it gradually throughout the year. But again, I just would point out that our broad-based specialty business, which includes our provider business and our practice management business are more impacted and are going to gradually improve over the balance of the year. The $45 million that I referenced earlier on that was across all of our businesses. It was, as Brian mentioned, to pay bonuses to frontline workers in each of our businesses as well as donations that we made across communities as well as cost to set up remote work environments, again, in our corporate environment, but also in our businesses. That's obviously part of the year-over-year comparison that is included in our FY 2020 Q4 results, and that will be included in for comparison purposes in FY 2021.
Brian Tyler: Yes. Those are actions taken really early part of March as we assess the impact this would have on our teams, and frankly anticipated the impact on our communities. And we thought it was just an important part of who we are as a company to take those actions. Obviously, as we look to the year coming ahead, there will be some incremental expense to support social distancing, workplace reengineering, protection of customers, and employees, and will be continued to be committed to make whatever investments we need to, to take care of them.
Holly Weiss: Next question.
Operator: Your next question will come from Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird.
Eric Coldwell: Thanks very much. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. A couple of just unrelated questions. First one, share repurchase. You expressed interest in continuing with that program, but weighted average shares outstanding, guidance seems a little bit higher than we would have expected given the low share price right now. I'm just curious if you can give us any specificity on what you're thinking about share repos? Second question, unrelated. U.S. oncology. Would be great to get an update on what you're seeing real-time with your practice management business and what impacts you're getting from COVID? Thanks very much. 
Britt Vitalone: Thanks, Eric. Let me start and take the first one off the table and then turn it over to Brian. As I mentioned, in the fourth quarter through the exit of Change Healthcare, we retired 15.4 million shares. And we've given you a guide of 161 million to 163 million. Our capital deployment program will include broad-based, balanced approaches we always have, and that will include M&A as it presents itself on strategy and with good returns, but it will also include continued to return capital to our shareholders which could include share repurchases, and we do have $1.5 billion remaining on the authorization, and we'll continue to use that to return capital as it's appropriate.
Brian Tyler: Yes. Let me maybe take up the U.S. oncology question. So we worked very closely with our partners in the practices to respond to this unprecedented time, and it's impacted all care providers. The U.S. oncology patient visits have certainly declined as social distancing guidelines were implemented, and that impact is really varied depending on what kind of oncology, what kind of answer you're experiencing? You see in the very fast-moving aggressive cancers, patient volume has not fallen off so much and some of the solid tumor cancers where progression is slower, people are more hesitant to go in and get testing, get diagnosis, may feel they had some time to delay. So we have seen a bit of visit decline, but the revenue decline has been less than the visit decline, which is encouraging to us. We've also taken actions to implement things like telepresence or virtual consultation services, and we've ramped up that pretty significantly in the last few months. So overall, I think, I'd say, we feel good about our positioning, oncology of all the ologies or specialties has probably been a little more insulated as you think about diseases that's probably not unexpected. But we continue to work closely with our practices to think about all the ways we can help feel make patients feel more comfortable to returning to their care.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Eric Percher with Nephron Research.
Eric Percher: Thank you for the details and for your efforts. A question on MedSurg, the metric on 60% of this being provider focused was helpful. I imagine there's some very different dynamics in the ASC versus the physician office. Could you help us with an understanding of what your distribution business here focuses on? I'm thinking less on PP&E potential benefits there. Are there significant pharmaceutical elements? Is there a number that you can provide us relative to the pharmaceutical component of medical and any expectations for vaccines or experience with the vaccines for children's program? How is that running? And how might you participate in vaccines in the future?
Brian Tyler: Great. Thanks, Eric. Appreciate that question. Our medical business does have a significant footprint in primary care, which we include the ambulatory surgery center in there. And within the kinds of practices, and we serve basically all different kinds of practices from general practitioners, OB GYN, even up to special – more specialty-oriented practices with medical products. And so there's been a pretty wide variation in the way specific specialties or focuses of those practice would have responded. And as you're well aware, we have a very broad offering to these practices. It is PP&E, which is tends to be a pretty small, historically, a very small part of these practices. Obviously, in the last months with social distancing and all the changes we've all experience, the PP&E demand is up significantly. But we're also in specialty Rx, Rx, lab, equipment, reagents, I mean, we've very, very broad business. And what I would say to you is that, we see patients volumes decline, and as Britt reviewed the metrics that we've seen there. I mean, really, all of those various elements have been impacted. And as patients begin to return to the practices, we think we'll begin to see those volumes all rebuild over the course of the coming year. It's obviously, from a vaccine perspective, it's a little early. Vaccines are not on market. But I would remind everybody, we have quite an extensive footprint in the distribution of vaccines today. We do distribute vaccines through the medical business to all of our practice areas. We work with CDC and their Vaccine for Children program as a supplier of those vaccines. Many years ago when H1N1 hit us, we worked with public partners to facilitate a program to manage that vaccine. So we're very engaged with all the various agencies that will have interest in this interest in this with our manufacturer partners to make sure we're availing our insights and our knowledge and our capability. And I suspect that as vaccines come to market, acceptance ramps up, we'll have to look at what is the production, how does that production scale up and how fast? but we would expect to be very engaged in those discussions.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa Gill: Thanks very much and good morning. Brian, can you give us an update on where you are as far as an opioid potential settlement? I know we talked about the framework, which was several months ago. Sitting here today, I would anticipate that states being in a difficult financial position may be more likely to want to move forward. So if you could just give us any update there, that would be really helpful.
Brian Tyler: Sure, Lisa. I'd be happy to. I mean, probably goes without saying that our primary focus the last weeks and months has been on responding to COVID-19, supporting our communities and our customers in that response. And I'm sure the same has been true for a lot of the public officials that have been involved, I guess, on the other side of this opioid issue. I really don't think there's a lot to add to the opioid issue. I really don't think there's a lot to add to the commentary we provided last time in terms of the specifics of the settlement discussions. I mean, we continue to be engaged we continue to be hopeful that a broad resolution can be achieved. We do think that one of the drivers has always been for us, the recognition that people and communities have needs, and it would be great to get the resolution for them and those needs are probably greater now than ever.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey good morning guys. Brian or Britt, as I think about the guidance, and obviously, I appreciate all the color you've given in terms of your assumptions. But as we stare down a recession heading into 2021, I mean, based on your experience being with the company during the last recession, how are you thinking about just the likely decline in physician office visits and how your business will be resilient through that?
Brian Tyler: Great question. We've -- our business has been through many economic cycles over its history. Fortunately, Britt and I have been here for all of them, but we were here for the '08, '09. What I would say in general is, I think our business model is pretty resilient to an economic recession. And I think if you look back over history, you would see that to be the case. I will say this situation is a little bit different, though, because it's an economic recession, but it's really driven by an underlying health pandemic and so in my mind, the way the business will respond is a little bit more about how we respond to the health pandemic than a “Recession”. The faster patients get comfortable being out of their homes, the faster they get comfortable going into health care settings, the faster social policy, testing, tracing, all these things we're talking about in the business and the public community as these comes to place and our confidence resumes, I think that's really what's going to tilt the trajectory. And so for me, it's much more about how healthcare demand comes back than the general economic climate. I mean, there's always puts and takes with are you uninsured with no coverage? Do you go to the Medicaid? But those are -- we tend to be a little insulated from that. So I think it's really all about how quickly confidence comes back in patients consuming health care services.
Britt Vitalone: Yes. I might just add that our guidance really assumes that health care demand will return. We've seen that in prior recessions like this. And our guidance really assumes that it's a gradual build over the course of the year. We're already seeing some -- as I mentioned, we're seeing some evidence of modest increases in May that's early obviously, but we do expect that health care demand will return, and we do expect that we'll be well positioned for that and really in all the different settings that we participate in.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research.
Stephen Baxter: Hey, thanks for the question. I hope you all are doing well. This is a bit of a follow-up on the prior question about the economy in a more normalized recession. I was hoping you could spend a little time talking about how we should think about the financial healthier customers and how you could see the business being impacted by that in the coming months and years. For example, there are headlines in the news today were even large and well-funded businesses are seeking relief from landlords. So I guess, what, if anything, are your customers asking of you at this stage? Any insight into your conversations with your customers would be helpful? Thanks.
Brian Tyler: Thanks for that question. And it's a really good question. And we've been working with our customers since the pandemic really started, and particularly those customers who have had to shut their doors on a temporary basis. We did record a small incremental reserve in our medical business in the fourth quarter, and I called that out. It's really more a mechanical adjustment. We've been working very closely to try to understand when they -- when these customers would reopen, what the demand is in each of their businesses. And to this point, our customers have either been able to go out and get loans or access public funds that are available, we work very closely with us, and we've been able to help them and really understand what their situation is. So we've not really seen a degradation in credit quality to this point. We'll continue to work very closely with those relationships. At this point, I think our customers are very resilient as well, and we're very close in working with them to keep them as credit resilient as possible.
Britt Vitalone: Yes. And based on the way we've described our expectation for volume to come back gradually over the course of the year and based on what we see now, you did call out that we built into our assumptions is that there is no major insolvency event now our assumptions play out correctly based on our conversations and what we are seeing, that will continue to be true. So risk, we'll monitor very closely over the course of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays.
Steven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning, Brian and Britt, I hope everyone is staying safe. So I just have two interrelated questions on the European business. First, I guess, I'm curious how the German JV transaction with Walgreens impacts the FY 2021 guidance for the European segment. Germany generally included or excluded from the European guidance. And then second, I guess, whether Germany is in there or not, I guess, what really sticks out to me is that the magnitude of the expected decline in operating profit in Europe, minus 20% to minus 25% relative to the revenue guide, 0% to minus 5%, 6% out a little bit, suggesting some notable negative operating leverage in Europe versus some of the other segments. Any color on the dynamics there would help as well. Thanks.
Brian Tyler: Generally. So start with the German JV. I don't think this will be material to our fiscal 2020 -- fiscal 2021. It is in competition review right now. We think it's continuing to progress on the timelines we expected to. So not really a lot to add to that. As it relates to the fiscal 2021 impact on Europe, I mean, obviously, we're dealing with 13 countries that are going to have – have had 13 different kind of degrees of challenge and reaction with associated social policy to that challenge. And so, when we look at an aggregate level, it's going to depend a little bit on how these countries open and what their response will be. I will say that in the U.K., our largest country in Europe, I mean, they have been one of the more severely impacted and have had some of the more severe social restrictions implied, and that's what you're seeing really flow through our numbers.
Britt Vitalone: Maybe if I would just add on. Our German business, as we talked about previously, is relatively immaterial to the overall European results. It is included – we did include Germany in our FY 2021 plan. But again, it's relatively immaterial. I would just point to the fact that our second half European results in FY 2020 were quite good and we exited the year with pretty strong performance. And as we think about FY 2021, really gets back to what we've talked about with many of our other businesses, that there is a temporary shock that is more severe in the first half of the year. And as Brian mentioned, mix matters a lot. How do countries open, one by one, they'll open at different rates in different times. And that mix is really what you're seeing flow through our business and our 2021 outlook.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. My question is focus on generic pricing. We're hearing that manufacturing in India is below historical levels and obviously, freight costs are seeing some step up. So what are you seeing on the buy side environment. How are you thinking about return to generic inflation in mid or fiscal year 2021? And then also along the line of manufacturing yesterday, HHS gave some funding of manufacturing of drugs in the U.S. Any thoughts of whether we will see generic manufacturing coming back to the U.S.? And what role would you play in that type of a scenario?
Britt Vitalone: Thanks, Ricky, for that question. Let me start with your first question and then let Brian take it from there. From a generic perspective, we continue to have a very strong sourcing organization, which has really benefited us well as we've gone through this period. The relationships that we have with manufacturers, our ability to continue to secure supply in a very stable and consistent manner has played well for us. On the sell side, we continue to see a relatively stable environment. And so there's competition, but pricing has continued to be stable and competitive. And so that's allowed us to continue to earn a spread on our generic products. And I think it really – it starts with our ability to secure that supply in a consistent manner, and because one been able to do that very well over the last several years, honestly, and we expect that to continue into FY 2021.
Brian Tyler: Yes. I think from an overall perspective, I mean, it's been pretty good performance industry-wide in terms of supply availability. And obviously, we began monitoring this very closely. I mentioned we set up our critical care task force in really the end – very end of our fiscal 2020 to continue to monitor this, frankly get very detailed updates every week on that. So I think, generally, we still feel okay. I would say we've seen anything, I would describe the material change in pricing or ability to supply and things of that nature. I mean, to your last question about will generic supply come back to the U.S. or will – I think the broader question is, how will diversification and how will the supply community think about being a little bit more buffered for future events that may look like this. And that – those are – it's very early. I think there will be a lot of good questions asked, a lot of good work done. We do think anything done diversifies, availability of supplies creates kind of a insurance mechanism if you will.  We are supportive of that. We also have to recognize their trade-offs in that. I mean there are cost trade-offs and figuring out how that cost gets funded and whether that's working capital or cost of the product. We'll have to navigate ourselves through, but we're involved in many of these conversations, but I'd characterize them all as very early stage right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo with UBS.
Kevin Caliendo: Hi. Thanks for taking my call. I really wanted to delve into the cost side a little bit, understanding that there's an ongoing larger cost savings plan. But going through the businesses, if you would, talk about how much variable spending you have in each and really what the plan is just thinking and looking at the margins and backing into sort of what you're saying, the margins versus the revenues definitely look like, and I'm just trying to gauge how much variable spending you might be taking out of the business or not?
Brian Tyler: Yes. Thanks for that question. Certainly, each of our businesses is a little bit differently positioned in terms of fixed versus variable cost. And I think the challenge that we're having in our first half of the year in particular, is that the revenue declines are quite sharp and so that kind of revenue declines really putting pressure on the overall cost position. I did talk about the fact that we've implemented mitigation plans across all of our businesses and across all of our different cost categories, and this is an extension of what we're already working on with our cost savings program. So we're certainly making great progress on that. We do have some things in our structure that will remain the same year-over-year in our material, like that will the opioid litigation-related costs, which we expect, which we expect to continue to be $150 million. But generally speaking, our variable costs will adjust with the volumes that we're seeing. But because some of our businesses have more significant and severe declines in volumes over the first half of the year, there will be some deleveraging that occurs in our businesses over that period. And as the year goes on, cost savings initiatives that we put in place, not only our cost savings program, but these mitigation activities will generally start to benefit our businesses and lead to that growth that we're seeing over the second half of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Guggenheim.
Glen Santangelo: Yes, thanks for taking my call. I just want to follow-up on this negative operating profit leverage question. I mean, I appreciate all the details. But maybe, Britt, could you unpack the guidance a little bit at the gross margin line, particularly as it relates to things like mix and drug pricing and contract renewals because what I think all of us are probably trying to understand is maybe how much of the operating profit contraction may be the result of a weaker gross margin versus lower revenues or incremental expenses related to maybe help us better assess how much of the incremental expenses was maybe onetime versus ongoing? Thanks.
Britt Vitalone: Thanks for that question. Again, what I would come back to here is and I've tried to give you a little bit more detail into where we're seeing the impacts on our business. And in particular, if you just talk about our medical business for a moment, that medical business has an adjusted operating profit – rate of over 800 basis points that is one of the most severely impacted of our business. And we try to give you a little bit more detail in the sense that our primary care business, where we have lots of capabilities and services that we provide there, about 60% of that medical business is primary care sites, which have been the most severely impacted. So what I would say is, it's not necessarily a cost issue. And we have additional cost for protecting our employees, and sanitation and cleaning in our distribution facilities. This is more a first half mix issue, particularly in our provider businesses and our medical business which as you know has a higher adjusted operating profit rate.
Holly Weiss: Operator we have time for one more question.
Operator: That question will come from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.
George Hill: Hey, good morning guys. And thanks for taking my question. I thought Glen have just kind of stormed it, but I will dive in on the U.S. margin guide one more time. You guys called out in Q4 that branded generic conversions, which we normally think of as a tailwind to margins or a positive impact. I guess, as we look at the 2021 margin guidance in the drug segment, could you kind of rank order what's driving what's driving the margin erosion when we think of either customer mix, product mix, VA renewal or COVID, just kind of rank ordering the negative margin mix? Thanks.
Britt Vitalone: Yes. Thanks for that question. Again, I would come back to what we're seeing is within our business, our specialty provider businesses are most impacted. So that's certainly having a big impacted in the first half of the year. We've called out very similar types of mid-single-digit branded price increase rates that we’ve seen over the past couple of years, especially not an impact, renewables are not an impact we talked about, we've been able to renew our – three of our largest customers without an impact to our guide. So I'll just get back to -- as you think about where the recovery and the shape of the curve in our business is most severely impacted is our physician sites, our specialty provider sites, those tend to be higher growth and higher-margin businesses for us, and that mix is really what's impacting the business. There's nothing fundamentally or structurally going on within our business. Our business continues to be very, very fundamentally sound. This is a matter of a temporary decline in revenue and really, a mix issue of where that revenue is coming from, but there's nothing fundamentally changing within the business itself.
Brian Tyler: Great. Well, thank you. Thank you, everybody, for your participation today, for your interest in McKesson and certainly, your great questions. I want to thank Lashana for facilitating this call for us. Obviously, this was a little longer call than we typically have, but we thought it was very appropriate given the environment to try to provide a little more detail insight into what's going what's going on in the business. McKesson has navigated challenges many times before. Our industry and our countries have navigated these kinds of challenges many times before. I think it's fair to say, I know I and we all probably take great inspiration from our frontline health care workers and our essential workers like those in McKesson. I want to thank the 80,000 members of the team McKesson for their dedication and the inspiration they provide me every day. I am confident that, we're well positioned to emerge from this experience as a stronger business and in strong communities. On behalf of our team at McKesson, we wish you and your families good health and wellness. We very much look forward to seeing you soon.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-02-04 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to McKesson's Q3 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Holly Weiss. Please go ahead.
Holly Weiss: Thank you, Jack. Good morning and welcome, everyone, to McKesson's third quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. Today I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer, and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off followed by Britt and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements such as forecasts about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's press release and our slide presentation and to the risk factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Additional information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results is included in today's press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website at investor.mckesson.com. With that, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Holly. And good morning and thank you, everyone, for joining us on our call this morning.  Before I get into our third quarter results, I wanted to take a few minutes to provide a brief update on opioid litigation. As you know, we've been engaged in complex discussions with the state attorney generals and others about a settlement framework with the goal of achieving a broad resolution of opioid-related claims. Those discussions continue to narrow what's left to address to achieve resolution on all the items that remain.  However, to the extent our efforts to reach a broad resolution settlement framework are unsuccessful, McKesson continues to be prepared to litigate and vigorously defend the mischaracterizations that our company drove the demand for opioids in this country.  McKesson remains firmly committed to being part of the broader solution to this crisis. Given, however, the discussions and litigation are ongoing, I'll be somewhat limited in what I can say. I do appreciate your understanding. Now, let's get to our business results. Today, we reported third-quarter total company revenues of $59.2 billion. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $3.81 and I'm pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date execution across the majority of our businesses in our fiscal 2020. Also today, we reaffirmed our fiscal 2020 full year outlook of $14.60 to $14.80 of adjusted earnings per diluted share which we first provided on January 13. This update reflects our outlook for growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, primarily driven by specialty, strength in our medical surgical segment, lower-than-anticipated corporate expenses and the benefit from share repurchase activity in the third quarter. Our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment performed well in the quarter, reflecting stable macro fundamentals and good execution, and was aided by the continued strong growth across our specialty businesses. Let me walk you through the recent trends from an industry fundamental standpoint. For the third quarter, we saw branded price increases tracking in line with our expectations and we continue to assume mid-single digit branded price increases year-over-year for fiscal 2020. For generics, we remain disciplined in our approach to the market. We're sourcing effectively through our scaled sourcing venture and the sell side remains competitive, but stable. I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge how pleased we are that the VA announced in December it had again selected McKesson to be the prime pharmaceutical vendor beginning in August 2020. We've been the VA's prime pharmaceutical vendor for veterans hospitals and the department's mail-order pharmacies for more than 15 years. This is a great point of pride for McKesson and we're dedicated to hiring veterans and helping them build their careers after their service. And  At McKesson, we have many employee resource groups celebrating and leveraging the diversity of our workforce. The McKesson Military Resource Group, or MMRG as we refer to it internally, provides opportunities for all employees to recognize and welcome veterans and their families to McKesson. MMRG offers networking opportunities; facilitates personal and professional development; supports McKesson's recruitment, hiring and retention of veterans; and sponsors events within our communities for active duty military and veterans. I want to thank McKesson's veterans – and every veteran really – for their service. We're very proud to serve the VA and we look forward to continuing our long-standing partnership. Moving to specialty, as you've heard me discuss at several recent events, we have a differentiated portfolio of assets and capabilities that was built over time, with targeted internal and external investments. First, we distribute specialty pharmaceuticals via the traditional wholesale model to retail and hospital pharmacies. And although these products are margin and rate dilutive, we benefit from this growth at the top line and in our gross profit dollars. Next, we distribute specialty products that are primarily infused in the community-based setting and typically require special handling, including temperature control. We also provide other services, like group purchase organization activities, data and technology services in oncology and other multispecialty practices. And then, we have our leading practice management business, specifically The US Oncology Network, which now includes more than 1,200 oncology physician, providing 12% to 13% of all community-based oncology care. We handle all aspects of managing the practice, so that the physician can focus on treating the patient. In addition, we're active in clinical trials, research and formulary development. The practice manager business, combined with the wholesale distribution and specialty product distribution and services business, are the scale channels we leverage to provide services and solutions to our many biopharma partners, including commercialization, hub and patient assistance services. We help manufacturers find patients that are appropriate and relevant-for-care, help them get started on that therapy sooner and work to keep them adherent to that therapy for the course of their treatment.  This results in a patient getting the best possible outcome from their treatment. These services not only support better outcomes for patients, but they also provide tremendous value to our manufacturer partners.  We're really pleased with the growth we're seeing across these businesses and we remain focused on specialty as a key tenet of our strategic direction. We're also pleased that we're returning the growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment in fiscal 2020, while continuing to invest in our future. Now, let me turn to Europe. In mid-December, McKesson and Walgreens announced a joint venture agreement that we expect will bring together our respective wholesale operations in Germany. After review of our business in Germany, we believe this is the right course of action as the combined business will have large reach and scale, driving increased efficiency and performance in a market where scale is vitally important. The transaction is subject to merger clearance and approval and that process is expected to take at least six months from the time of the announcement. As such, this transaction will not have any impact on adjusted earnings in our current fiscal year. In the UK, we continue to monitor the retail pharmacy funding dynamics. As we detailed earlier in the fiscal year, the retail pharmacy industry experienced underfunding by the NHS in our first quarter. While there was a modest improvement in our fiscal second quarter, further upward revisions have not yet been implemented. We continue to monitor the situation in the UK closely and engage in active dialogue with the NHS related to industry funding and the role pharmacy can play in managing NHS's overall cost, quality and access challenges. Outside of the UK, we're continuing to see performance in line with our expectations for the other countries in this segment. Next, our Medical Surgical business. Again, this quarter, we had good growth across multiple markets, such as our home care delivery business and product categories, including pharmaceutical sales into the primary care space. Customers are repeatedly choosing McKesson because of our relentless focus on providing what they need to take care of their patients. We differentiate ourselves in the marketplace through innovation and a focus on operational excellence, breadth of product and service offerings, along with one of the largest and most tenured sales forces in the industry. We also saw an early start to the influenza season in the third quarter, which we are continuing to monitor for severity and duration. In addition, our results continue to reflect the integration of the MFD acquisition, which we lapped during our first quarter, and our focus is now on driving synergies. This acquisition continues to perform in line with its business case. Turning to other, which primarily consists of Canada, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions, sometimes referred to as MRxTS, and our investment in Change Healthcare. In Canada, we're now capturing the benefits of previous actions we've taken, including our investments in people and in reconfigured pharmacy formats as community pharmacy plays an important role in Canadian healthcare.  And market fundamentals are stable, which helped to drive growth in our wholesale operations year-over-year. In addition, McKesson Canada also has broad specialty assets and capabilities and we are well-positioned to participate in the growth of specialty in the Canadian market. Moving on to MRxTS, which is a key area of investment. We're making investments to ensure we have the right product and personnel resources in place to support the growth trajectory of these businesses and are looking to launch new products that leverage our existing technologies and build upon them. As we look at how MRxTS is performing year-to-date, we're pleased with the growth in the business, which is net of several investments we are making to drive and support our future growth. Let's move on to Change Healthcare. As we discussed previously, we continue to take the customary steps toward an exit of our investment in Change Healthcare.  As part of the exit process, registration statements were filed today with the SEC. The previously discussed timing, expectations are unchanged and this is simply a necessary step as we move through the process of exiting our investment in change healthcare.  Recently, you've heard me talk about aligning McKesson under one vision, to improve care in every setting, one product, one partner, one patient at a time. We've been transforming and energizing the culture at McKesson. We've got a great collaborative workspace at our new headquarters in the Dallas area. We've rolled out new enterprise behaviors, building on the already-strong foundation of our ICARE and ILEAD values and getting everyone aligned around our strategy on how we want to work together to execute it. We're looking to become a simpler, more focused and nimbler organization. We've centralized some of our functions and are looking at ways to work more efficiently and to utilize technology for day-to-day tasks that can be automated, freeing up time to focus on strategy, a work that drives value for the organization and better leverages our teams.  We're seeing great execution across the enterprise, including cost savings, as we track towards our target of $400 million to $500 million in gross pretax savings by the end of our fiscal 2021. Our organization has rallied around these efforts and it's showing in the culture and the results. I could not be prouder of the McKesson team. And with one quarter to go in fiscal 2020, I'm confident in our reaffirmed adjusted earnings outlook of $14.60 to $14.80 per diluted share. As we look forward, we're in the initial stages of planning for fiscal 2021. Let me walk through some of the things we're thinking about. The timing and impact of the exit of our investment in Change Healthcare as exit activities are currently underway.  For customer renewals, the VA contract goes into effect in August 2020. As a reminder, we've stated that this new contract will not be a material headwind to our fiscal 2021 outlook. We are continuing to progress against our cost savings target with a portion of those savings falling to the bottom line and a portion being reinvested for growth. And finally, from a capital allocation perspective, we would anticipate benefits from share repurchases completed in fiscal 2020. As we think about the market and the macro perspective in the US, we're entering an election year and will make assumptions related to any potential impact we might expect based on our analysis, including related to drug pricing trends. McKesson will continue to engage with policymakers and industry partners to ensure that any reforms support solutions to improve cost, quality and access. The policy landscape remains a dynamic environment and we remain confident in McKesson's path forward. As it relates to the UK, we're continuing to monitor the market environment and NHS funding as well as Brexit activities.  We will review our businesses and expectations, including the impact of external factors, and will provide our fiscal 2021 outlook in May when we report fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal 2020 earnings. Before I turn the call over to Britt, I want to take just a moment to thank Kathy McElligott who just retired from McKesson. In her role as Chief Information and Technology Officer, she helped McKesson increase its focus on data and analytics and accelerate our technology modernization. Kathy, thank you for your contributions to McKesson. And on the flipside, I'd like to also welcome Nancy Flores, who is succeeding Kathy as CIO and CTO. Nancy has a long track record of success in healthcare IT and we look forward to utilizing her experience as we remain focused on our mission to improve healthcare in every setting by leveraging technology solutions for our company, our customers and our business partners. And with that, let me turn the call over to Britt to go through the financials.
Britt Vitalone : Thank you, Brian. And good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here this morning to talk about a solid third quarter for McKesson. I'll focus on our third quarter results and full-year fiscal 2020 guidance, including changes you could consider as you update your models. Brian walked you through high-level puts and takes as we think about our fiscal 2021 guidance and we'll provide detailed assumptions for fiscal 2021 when we report fourth-quarter and full-year results in May. We're pleased with our adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per diluted share results in the third quarter which were ahead of our expectations and represent solid execution. We continue to see momentum across the business as we execute against our strategic initiatives. As a result of this momentum and based on the confidence in our fourth-quarter outlook, on January 13, we raised and narrowed our fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $14.60 to $14.80 per diluted share from the previous range of $14 to $14.60 per diluted share. And today, we're reaffirming that adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance. Updated guidance assumptions can be found in our third quarter earnings slide presentation, which is posted on our Investors section of our website. Before I provide more details on our third quarter adjusted results, I want to address one item that impacted our GAAP-only results in the quarter. During the third quarter, we reported a pre and post-tax charge of $282 million, with a remeasurement to fair value of the net assets from the majority of McKesson's German wholesale business in relation to the expected formation of a new German wholesale joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. Moving now to the adjusted earnings results for the quarter. Our third quarter adjusted EPS was $3.81, an increase of 12% compared to the prior year, which was primarily driven by organic growth in U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, the Medical Surgical segment and the European segment. To better understand our third quarter results, let me remind you of two discrete events in our prior-year third quarter, both within our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment. First, the $60 million pretax charge related to the bankruptcy of Shopko. And second, a pretax benefit of approximately $17 million related to the reversal of accrued New York State Opioid Stewardship Act charges. If you normalize for these two items, Q3's fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 7%.  Moving to the details of our consolidated results on slide four. Consolidated revenues for the third quarter increased 5% versus the prior period, primarily driven by growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, driven by branded pharmaceutical price increases and higher retail national account volumes. We continue to anticipate mid to high-single digit percent consolidated revenue growth for the full year. Third quarter adjusted gross profit increased 4% year-over-year, principally due to organic growth in our Medical Surgical and U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses increased 3% year-over-year, driven by higher corporate expenses which include planned technology investments. Adjusted income from operations was $958 million for the quarter, which was up 4% year-over-year or 5% on an FX-adjusted basis. As a result of this solid performance and our updated outlook, we're guiding full year adjusted income from operations to increase a low single-digit percent. Interest expense of $64 million in the quarter declined 4% compared to the prior year and our adjusted tax rate was 17.1% for the quarter, which included discrete tax benefits of approximately $36 million. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate assumption remained approximately 18% to 19%.  Wrapping up our consolidated results, our third quarter diluted weighted average shares were $180 million, a decrease of 8% year-over-year. During the quarter, we completed approximately $500 million of share repurchases, bringing our year-to-date total share repurchases to $1.9 billion. As a result, we now expect diluted weighted average shares of approximately 182 million for the year. Next, I'll review our segment results which can be found on slides 5 through 8. Before I start with my review of the segments, including updated full-year guidance, I want to reiterate that we provide full-year guidance and do not provide quarterly guidance. As a reminder, there are a number of items, particularly in our largest segment, U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, that can cause fluctuations on quarter-to-quarter basis. While this can make comparing year-over-year results in a quarterly basis difficult, these items do tend to balance out over the course of the year.  These items include customer volumes, customer and product mix, brand price increases and the timing of discrete tax item. We anticipate that there could be additional fluctuations in our fourth-quarter results. Let me now start with U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions. Revenues were $46.9 billion for quarter, up 6%, driven by branded pharmaceutical price increases and continued growth by our largest retail national customers, partially offset by branded to generic conversion. Third-quarter adjusted operating profit increased 11% to $658 million, primarily driven by the execution and growth in our differentiated portfolio of specialty businesses.  As I mentioned earlier, there were two discrete items included in our prior-year third-quarter results. A $60 million pretax charge related to the bankruptcy of Shopko and a pretax benefit of approximately $70 million related to the reversal of accrued New York State Opioid Stewardship Act charges. If your adjust for these two prior-year items, the segment adjusted operating profit was up 3.5% year-over-year in the quarter. Also, as a reminder, this is the final quarter in which we are lapping the effects of the lost Shopko earnings, which was approximately $8 million per quarter in terms of operating profit. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 140 basis points, an increase of 6 basis points.  On a year-to-date basis, the segment adjusted operating profit is up 7%. You adjust for the prior-year impact of the $60 million pretax charge related to the bankruptcy of Shopko and the prior-year earnings contribution of approximately $24 million from three quarters of Shopko results, segment adjusted operating profit increased 5% year-to-date.  For the third quarter, brand price activity trended in line with our expectation. Additionally, based on manufacturer price actions taken in January, we are maintaining our full-year fiscal 2020 assumptions for brand price increases to be in the mid-single digit percent range. I would remind you that our branded pharmaceutical contracts are primarily fixed fee for service rate in nature. And as a result, our compensation with branded manufacturers is less impacted by price increases when compared to several years ago. To wrap up this segment, given the underlying strength in the quarter and the year-to-date performance, we have confidence that segment adjusted operating profit growth will be on the high-end of the previously provided range of 3% to 5% growth for fiscal 2020.  Next, European Pharmaceutical Solutions. Revenues were $6.9 billion for the quarter, which was flat year-over-year. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues increased 3%, driven primarily by market growth in the pharmaceutical distribution business. Segment adjusted operating profit was up 16% to $80 million, driven in part by lower operating expenses as a result of actions previously taken to rationalize store footprint and streamline back office functions. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 116 basis points on a constant currency basis, an increase of 16 points. Moving to Medical Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $2.1 billion for quarter, which was up 6%, driven by organic growth, led by the primary care business, including higher pharmaceutical volumes and an earlier start to the influenza season. Segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter was up 8% to $184 million, driven by organic growth. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 859 basis points, an increase of 14 basis points. Year-to-date, the segment adjusted operating profit growth is 18%. As a result of the organic growth in the segment year-to-date, we now anticipate that the segment adjusted operating profit for fiscal 2020 will increase by a low double-digit percent year-over-year.  And finishing our business review with Other. Revenues were $3.2 billion for the quarter, which was up 6%, driven primarily by organic growth in the Canadian wholesale business. Other adjusted operating profit was down 4% to $214 million, in part driven by higher strategic product investments in our Prescription Technology Solutions business, or MRxTS, partially offset by growth in our Canadian wholesale business. Closing our segment review with Change Healthcare. Adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $51 million for the quarter. As a reminder, our equity investment ownership in Change Healthcare was approximately 58.5% in our fiscal third quarter 2020 point as compared to 70% in the prior-year. As Brian mentioned earlier, registration statements were filed this morning with the SEC, disclosing our intention to exit our investment in Change Healthcare via an exchange offer. This is the next step in the process to exit our investment in a tax efficient manner. I direct you to today's filing for additional information. Next, McKesson recorded $170 million in adjusted corporate expenses, which was an increase of 29% year-over-year, driven primarily by planned technology investments, which included investments in data and analytic capabilities. For the third quarter, we reported net opioid-related adjusted operating expenses of $36 million and year-to-date $108 million. For fiscal 2020, we continue to anticipate that opioid-related costs will approximately be $150 million. We continue to make solid progress against our cost savings programs, which include a focus on our core operating expenses, by leveraging the scale of our enterprise and the continued transformation of back-office functions. We remain on track with our previously announced annual pretax savings of $400 million to $500 million, which is anticipated to be substantially delivered by the end of fiscal 2021. As we discussed, the portion of these savings will be reinvested back into the business, in line with our growth initiatives and the remaining will flow the bottom line. As a result of our performance year-to-date, we now anticipate adjusted corporate expenses to be in the range of $660 million to $700 million. Now that I've wrapped up our results, let me discuss our updated fiscal 2020 outlook. We feel really good about our steady execution throughout fiscal 2020. The recent narrowing and increase to our fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings per diluted share to a range of $14.60 to $14.80 reflects the following. Solid core performance in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, driven by continued strength across our differentiated portfolio of specialty businesses; organic growth in our Medical Surgical segment; improved second-half performance in our European segment as compared to the prior year; lower corporate expenses than originally anticipated; and a lower share count as a result of share repurchase activity year-to-date. This solid performance was partially mitigated by continued planned investments in strategic initiatives, including incremental second-half investment in our differentiated oncology and manufacturer services businesses, the investment in our technology products; and investment in technology infrastructure, including data and analytics. We remain confident that we are well-positioned to execute in our fourth quarter. Turning now to cash which can be found on slide 10. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.1 billion. In the quarter, McKesson used $121 million in cash flow from operations. After deducting $154 million in internal capital investments, McKesson had negative free cash flow of $275 million. I would remind you that our working capital metrics and resulting cash flow may be impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of the given quarter. It is not uncommon to experience net use of cash during our fiscal third quarter, primarily driven by the build in inventory for the holiday season. In our fiscal fourth quarter, we typically generate more than two-thirds of our annual operating cash flow. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $500 million of common stock. We've now repurchased approximately $1.9 billion in common stock for the first nine months of fiscal year. The repurchase of our common stock underpins our belief that McKesson shares are undervalued. Combined with the confidence in our execution and our outlook, we view this as a prudent use of capital. For the first nine months of the fiscal year, McKesson paid $97 million for acquisition and $222 million in dividend. We now expect internal capital investments to be in the range of $500 million to $600 million and we continue to anticipate free cash flow in the range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. In closing, we are pleased with the solid operational results of our fiscal third quarter and our performance year-to-date. We will build on our third quarter performance and we remain confident in our business as we focus on a strong finish to the year, which is reflected in our expected adjusted earnings per diluted share range of $14.60 to $14.80 for fiscal 2020. As I look at our performance over the past several quarters and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2020, it clearly demonstrates focus and execution against our strategy, as well as continued, steady improvement in our financial results. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator? 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Your line is open.
Charles Rhyee: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe, Brian, if I start with – just on opioids real quickly. What are the remaining points that are being negotiated? You kind of said that the negotiations are going well or seem to be progressing and some of the points are being resolved. Maybe you can give us a sense of what are some of the remaining kind of sticking points perhaps.  And if I understand correctly, the framework is being discussed among – or is being led by four state attorney generals. During these kind of discussions, are the other constituents, let's say, the other states or some of the bigger municipalities that are in this lawsuit or part of this multidistrict litigation? Are they able to sort of see the progress as well and understand what is being kind of negotiated, so that when we get to maybe a final framework, the process with them to review and to accept is kind of in tandem or is this kind of being done in kind of a closed session and then opened up later?
Brian Tyler: Thank you for the question, Charles. And I think the way you frame the question, naming the number of parties or counterparties or folks involved in this discussion helps to frame why it's moving at the cadence that it's moving. We do continue to be in constructive dialogue with the AGs. The AGs have broadened their group and they continue to talk amongst themselves.  The good news from my perspective is the basic framework that we've laid out is still the framework that's being discussed and the details for the many component parts of that are progressing well. There is still a long way to go with regard to ultimately getting as broad of AG support as we can and then AGs themselves going to their subdivisions and extending that broad support. So, there is a lot of work that is ongoing. The discussions are really continuous. It would be too early for me to try to project a timeline or where the finish line might be. But I am pleased that the framework that we've been negotiating continues to be the framework, the details are progressing. And I think as we get through the coming months, we'll begin to assess what the various AG and sub-municipality positions are.
Charles Rhyee: Great. If I could have a follow-up, just on the core business, obviously, you increased your outlook on the core pharmaceutical segment here. It seems like a lot of things are moving in the right direction. Is there anything you'd point to specifically that is kind of driving the improved outlook here? Thank you.
Brian Tyler: Maybe I'll start and then Britt may want to offer a few comments. I think if you think about the general kind of industry fundamentals, the brand price inflation has been in line with where we thought it would be. The generic market is continuing to behave in a way that we had forecast. And by that, I mean our skill sourcing entity continues to produce in line with our anticipation. We are going in the market with a very disciplined approach, reflective of the transition our industry has been in. And we think that the competitive – the sell side in the generics market remains stable. It's competitive and there's pressures, but it's stable.  I think we're seeing the benefits of a lot of the work and planning that we've been – for the last several quarters, we've been executing and implementing. And so, combining that I think with the market fundamentals and our really good positions in specialty is driving the results that you see.
Britt Vitalone: Maybe I might just add. I think Brian you hit on it here. The focus and our execution against our differentiated assets, particularly specialty, and you talked a lot about that, I think is really driving a lot of this.  And then, I would just reiterate that our cost programs are really driving, not only in our corporate line, but also across our segment. And so, that focus is not only on our core set of differentiated assets, but just disciplined and focus around costs across not only our corporate segments, but our business segments.
Charles Rhyee: Thank you.
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Charles.
Operator: And next will be Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut : Hi. Good morning. And congrats on a good quarter. So, I guess, the question for me, as I think about it, Brian, you talked about the execution and how you guys seem really positive about it. So, how do you think about the runway remaining in specialty as we head into fiscal 2021, without going into guidance specifically, and just how you're looking at the volume outlook from the key accounts because it sounds like that's a volume driver that's been driving some upside as well? Thanks.
Brian Tyler: Yeah. We're really pleased with our specially businesses. We talked a few weeks ago about the "core," the distribution of these products to hospitals and retail pharmacies as being our biggest segment. Clearly, we benefit there from the growth that these products have just in general. And the pipeline, if you look at the pipeline of the innovative products coming, they tend to look that way. And as you know, we've got established scale channels across both of these segments. And then, if you think about community setting, oncology, we have a clear leading stake. We're a leader in many of the other multispecialty settings. They're going to benefit from that same pipeline.  And I also think, if you step up from a more macro view, if you think about the challenges that the cost of healthcare represents in this country, we have a fundamental belief that to get access, cost and quality, care needs to continue to shift into the community-based settings. So, that's where our community provider business, I think, from a macro standpoint is well positioned.  And then, our US oncology business, we have particular depth and strength in oncology. And if you look at the pipeline there, that continues to be strong. So, I would say all those things are what are giving us our confidence. But at the bottom, at the end of the day, it's really the execution of the business that lets you capitalize on those macro trends and opportunities.
Brian Tanquilut : I guess my follow-up, Britt, you mentioned the cost cuts and the opportunities that you've found there. So, do you think there's a lot of runway left as we think about cost opportunities both on the corporate side and also on the operations side?
Britt Vitalone: Yeah, our cost program, Brian, what we talked about, we would capture these cost savings by the end of fiscal 2021. So, we're still making progress not only in leveraging the scale of our enterprise across all of our business units, but some of the things that we've talked about previously in terms of back office function transformation, and there's still opportunities there as the size of our enterprise allows us to continue to work across and collaborate and drive additional cost synergy. So, I would say that that program, as we talked about, is – we expect it to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2021. However, as the business grows and our focus and execution in specialty continues, there's still opportunities for us to leverage our scale and transform our back office function.
Brian Tyler: Efficiency is a core part of the way you have to run a business like this at this scale. So, it is a program that we implemented a few years ago. But most importantly, for me, it's a mindset. It's a part of the way we think about how we manage and run the business.
Brian Tanquilut : Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And next will be Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Jones: Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess just to go back to the segment guidance, and specifically the US Pharma segment, it seems like if I look at what's implied with 4Q, at the high end, it seems like you're kind of calling for year-over-year flat EBIT there in that segment. I know there's a number of moving pieces, Britt, but maybe could you just help us think about what the major swing factors are in 4Q because you guys highlighted the business there, in particular specialty seems to be performing well and there're some momentum, but it seems like 4Q, you're implying at least that things could potentially slow a bit? So, just want to make sure we had the moving pieces there correctly.
Britt Vitalone: Yeah, sure, Bob. You're right about the implied. What I would just come back to and point out is that I've talked about, in a business the size of ours, with customers that are growing and you have mix that is changing in terms of customer and product mix, we are going to see fluctuations from quarter to quarter. We've seen that historically. I think we're seeing that a little bit more of this year, some of our larger retail national customers are growing a little bit faster.  I think what we're pleased with, though, as Brian talked about, there're some stability in the pricing environment, particularly with branded pricing, certainly continue to – good progress against generics. But what you should expect, as I talked about at the beginning, is that we are going to see some items that are going to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We don't manage our business that way. We manage our business for the long haul. We look at our business on an annual basis. And these items do tend to balance out over the course of the year. We're very pleased that we started the year with being able to guide back to growth in this segment and we're very pleased that, given the momentum and the execution that Brian talked about, particularly in our specialty business, we could raise that guidance today to the upper ends. We're making good progress, but I think you should expect to continue to see some fluctuation in our quarterly results.
Robert Jones: No, that's fair. And then, I guess, Brian, you opened the door to a little bit of preliminary 2021 thoughts, and so I know we'll get more detail in May, but if I heard you correctly, it sounds like core drivers playing out in line this year with your expectations. You guys have highlighted the VA is not a material headwind. It sounds like cost savings will continue. It could be a benefit from capital allocation. All seem pretty neutral to tailwinds. Is there any major headwinds you would have us start to contemplate as we start to think about framing 2021 more specifically?
Brian Tyler: Well, look, as we come to May, we'll try to be very thoughtful and share with you our view of the thinking. If I think about what could materialize as headwinds, the policy arena has been dynamic probably for most of my career, but certainly for my tenure as CEO. And yet, while the clouds always seem to be gathering, nothing has really materialized. I would suspect we'll hear some commentary tonight. I think as we come into the face of election year, we'll be evaluating not only the policy proposals, but the politics that surround – that sort of set the framework for the likelihood of any of that really getting done. But to me that's just a normal part of being in healthcare and a normal part of being in this business.  I think, though, our European business is coming off of a good quarter, but our experience there, particularly in the NHS, has been – been challenges around being – having good line of sight into how the reimbursement mechanisms really play out. So, while we're encouraged that we have a five-year macro agreement with NHS for the pharmacy community there, I think underneath the nuances of the timing and the different mechanisms that make up that framework, we'll have to continue to monitor and evaluate. And those are the two things that first pop to mind. Anything you want to add, Britt?
Britt Vitalone: No, I think you captured them correctly, Brian.
Operator: And next will be Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa Gill: Good morning. Brain, I just want a follow-up on that last point as you talk about the policy arena. Clearly, specialty has been a growth area. You've talked the whole call about specialty. What are your thoughts around IPI and what it could mean your specialty business?  And then, secondly, as we think about the European markets, what have you learned from the European markets where it is a fixed cost environment versus here in the US?
Brian Tyler: Great. Thanks, Lisa. I'll take the IPI business first, the question first. So, IPI is – I guess there's been a lot of different constructs around getting to part B. There's been discussions of caps or limiting ASP rates, future caps on allowable inflation. IPI would be a proposal to index what the US pays based on a basket of internationally referenced prices for various products. I think there's even been some debate or discussion around MFN or most favored nation type clauses. So, the proposals have really been very wide in the spectrum. And without commenting on any of them specifically, I would say, first and foremost, we think any reform in Part B should be constructed – and we work with industry, the government and our partners to advocate for this – in a way that pushes care into the community. It's clearly the low cost, high access setting and we believe it has extremely high quality as well. So, it kind of hits all the three macro principles. And so, any reform that were to happen in our view should move care to the community. Anything that would move the opposite way would be counterproductive really for the US spend on healthcare in general. Now, relative to IPI, if something were to occur, the way I think about this is, in most instances, in our core pharma distribution, in our community provider setting, this is an implication to our customer. So, it'll be a secondary effect really from a wholesaler perspective. The one place we would have some exposure would be in The US Oncology Network, where – I'd remind you – through our partnership we share in the practice economics. So, we continue to watch this very closely. I'm not sure there's been a proposal that's had more commentary and more aligned commentary to kind of come out against it because of that impact potentially to patients and patient access and cost of care, but I suppose we'll see what we hear tonight.
Lisa Gill: Great. And then, just my follow-up, I just – Britt, you talked about the Change exit as being one of the key component to 2021. And you said it's consistent with what you've said before. Can you just remind us what you've said before on the timeline of the exit?
Britt Vitalone: Sure, Lisa. So, what we've said previously, dating back to our Q2 earnings call, from that point in time, we would expect to exit our transaction in 6 months to 12 months, although it could be before the end of our fiscal 2020. So, I would reiterate that language today.
Operator: And next will be Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Ricky Goldwasser: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. I had follow-up question on the cost cutting initiative. I think you reduced your corporate expense guidance by about $45 million. Part of it is flow through of cost savings to the bottom line and some timing of investments. By our calculation, it's about $0.18 of EPS. So, as we think about the ongoing benefit of cost cutting, can we just kind of like run rate that $45 million that you said in the fourth quarter?
Brian Tyler: Yeah. Let me answer that, Ricky. Certainly, we are pleased with the progress that we're making against our cost initiatives. And I reiterate that we expect to generate $400 million to $500 million of savings by the end of 2021. So, the cost programs are ongoing.  As I called out at the beginning of the year, there were some additional investments that we were going to be making, particularly in the areas of information security management and data and analytics. We continue to make those investments, but we're seeing good efficiency across the organization. So, I don't think you can necessarily take our performance this quarter and just run it out. We're continuing to make investments in the business, but we're also continuing along getting the efficiencies from scale and some of the back office function.  So, what we wanted to do today was to update our guidance based on some of the benefits that we've seen in performance and execution, but we're continuing to make investments along as we generate those savings.
Ricky Goldwasser: Okay. And then, one follow-up up on Change. Obviously, I understand that the exit is tax efficient, but can you just remind us, directionally, kind of like the mechanics? Should we expect Change – what should we expect in term of impact? Would it be neutral to UPS, accretive or dilutive? And same, how should we think about just directionally the impact to cash?
Brian Tyler: Yeah. So, let me just remind you that today is the filing that is another step along our exit. We have nothing included in our FY 2020 guidance related to Change. So, there's no additional information that I can provide you on that. And in terms of when we exit, depending on – regardless of how we exit, there'll be no cash impact. 
Operator: And next will be Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi. Good morning, guys. Just a broader long-term picture on the specialty side, how do we think about the ramp up in sort of additional specialty services you're providing, in particular on the US oncology side, but maybe also in the core business? Are there key moments that cause either providers or other customers to take up those services? Is it something gradual? I'm just sort of looking for a longer term vision of that.
Brian Tyler: Yeah, it's a great question and it's obviously an area that we have some excitement about and we have spent really a good part of the last 10 years or 15 years building out, some through internal development and some through acquisition, a set of capabilities that are really oriented around helping manufacturers identify which patients are appropriate and should be benefiting from their therapy, finding those patients and getting them started on that therapy and then ensuring that they stay on that therapy through the full clinically appropriate course, so that they can get the best possible outcome.  So, the first good news in that is that the patient gets the best outcome. We think it's good for the patient, it's good for the healthcare system. Obviously, for our biopharma partners, that can result in more patients benefiting from their products. That has obvious benefit to them and that's a service. Therefore, they're quite interested in paying us for it.  So, as we think about building off of really our 20-year experience in this marketplace, building off of sets of assets that we've required for the commercialization of these products, there's opportunities to both refine and deepen and develop the tools we offer today. A few weeks ago, I shared an example of a program like that, we're calling, Access for More Patients, which fundamentally is getting at the same issue, but it's doing it in a more automated, efficient way that lets us find more patients and get them on those therapies faster. As we look at that as a core, we think there are opportunities to extend downstream and to get earlier stage services to support pharmaceuticals. And as we think about some of our provider segments, there's opportunity to do some integration with providers downstream. So, this is an area that we think, as you look at the pipeline, as you look at the products, as you look at what's happening in terms of – in the clinical trial space and the fragmentation of population that there's going to continue to be a good opportunity here for McKesson.
Elizabeth Anderson: Perfect. That's really helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And next will be Eric Coldwell with Baird.
Eric Coldwell: Thanks. Good morning. So, maybe just focus on the Med Surg segment for a second. You've mentioned the early flu season, consistent with peers. I'm curious if you could carve out for us what you think the incremental benefit of early flu was or heavy flu. And then, I know it's probably a bit early and maybe evolving situation, but coronavirus, any issues with sourcing out of the Asia-Pac region or pricing changes, demand changes in the US as maybe some facilities pre-stock certain gloves, gowns, masks et cetera? Just any questions on interzone coronavirus impact so far would be interesting. Thanks so much.
Britt Vitalone: Good morning, Eric. This is Britt. I'll take the first one and let Brian comment on the second. As I talked about in my remarks, we're really pleased with the performance of the medical business. We had good organic growth really across our business, but primarily in our primary care business. And then, I also called out higher pharmaceutical volumes as one of the drivers.  We did see some modest impact from early flu season. I would remind you, though, that typically the flu season has a larger impact on our fourth quarter than our third quarter. We did plan the year for a normal flu season, so we saw a little earlier start than we had anticipated. But, again, I would just remind you that the strong core organic growth across our primary care business, which was inclusive of higher pharmaceutical volumes, was really the driver for the performance.
Brian Tyler: I'll take the coronavirus. Maybe before that, we've been around this business for a long time. And we chart every year what the flu season – influenza season looks like in the US. And every season has its own cycle of rhythm, if you will. And so, I think it's fair to say, we have seen an early start. Ultimately, how that plays out will depend on the duration and the severity and it's probably hard to predict that right now.  Relative to coronavirus, I guess, let me start by first saying, our thoughts and sympathies go out to those, particularly in China, but really Asia, that are obviously dealing with this in a very real time way.  We, at McKesson, have really been working across industry partners, peers, trade associations, government agencies for the better part of three or four weeks. So, we try to jump on these things early and get ahead of them. And so, we're monitoring this very, very closely.  I would remind everybody that we don't manufacture these products. We procure them, we sell them and we distribute them. And we do have a domestic supplier base, although the majority of the products, the masks and the disinfectants and gowns are sourced from Asia or China.  I guess, fortunately or unfortunately, depending on your perspective, we had some experience with SARS and H1N1. And so, what we're doing is implementing the protocols, the monitoring capabilities that we built up through these prior experiences and working in close coordination with government agencies and industry partners to make sure we can keep the continuity of supply.  Now, what that ultimately looks like depends really on how does the virus continue to proliferate. Does it stay contained in a region? So, those are things that we just have to watch. But we wake up every day thinking about the markets that we serve and how we make sure we have products available for our customers that operate in those markets.
Operator: And next will be Michael Cherny with BofA Securities.
Michael Cherny: Thanks so much for taking the question. I guess, a lot of the key topics have been asked.The one thing that did stand out, you highlighted the recent success of the transaction side medical, really rocking it. Pretty low so far from an acquisition perspective, at least in terms of your historical spend year-to-date. As you're heading into fiscal 2021, as you are getting rid of the Change position on the balance sheet and the ownership stake, as you think forward of the portfolio, are there any macro trends that you think would drive some areas or opportunities for you to go and drive inorganic growth or anything from a broader picture perspective where your customers are really asking you to pursue an area that you may not be in or as strong as you would like to be right now?
Brian Tyler: Great question. I think we probably, if you look back over the past few years, we came through a cycle of pretty heavy M&A as we really bolstered some of the capabilities and assets that we thought surrounded our specialty biopharma manufacture value prop and our oncology business or ecosystem, however you want to think about that. And as we've done the work to integrate those, and it's a lot of work to integrate these things and to integrate them properly, in parallel, we've really been refining our strategies.  And you've probably heard me say this before. All good M&A follows a good strategy. And so, as we've put this strategy together, we've identified the areas that we think we have differentiated capabilities in markets that have good overall growth prospects.  So, when I think about capital deployment, we've obviously got to deploy capital to be invested in efficiency and some client and safe, secure, always-on environments. And then, the second area we'd look for is growth, but those growth investments, meaning M&A investments, have to be closely aligned to the strategy, and I think that that's what you should expect from us. So, we like growth investments. We like growth capital, either extend our capabilities or add scale to the places that we have capabilities. And while we always have to balance, I would say your strategy can't be based on M&A. It takes a buyer and a seller and it takes a price that you can agree on. So, as we've looked at the market and looked at those tradeoffs, obviously, the past 12 months or so, we've been favoring to deploy our capital or buy back our shares because we think those are a great investment, but we continue to be very active in looking for areas we can inorganically help support the growth. 
Operator: And next will be Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research.
Stephen Baxter: Hi. Thanks for the question. So, I wanted to ask about the generics business. You guys have been very clear that gross profit is growing here and that appears to be a pretty different result than the rest of the industry. So, from a macro point of view, it looks to us like the broader market is relatively flat. Just hoping to better understand what's driving your growth here in bigger picture terms. Are you growing generic revenue against the backdrop of stable margins, stable revenue with improving margins, really any color you can add on how you're achieving those results, so we can better assess sustainability going forward would be appreciated. Thank you.
Britt Vitalone: Good morning. I'll start and certainly Brian can add on. As we've talked about previously, we're really pleased with a couple of dimensions that lead – that are around our generics business. First of all, we have a scaled and efficient sourcing operation. We think we source as well as anybody and we continue to find opportunities from a sourcing perspective. We continue to be disciplined in a stable, yet competitive environment. We think that those dynamics are leading to our ability to generic gross profit growth. We are seeing some growth in units. And you combine that with scale in a competitive, but stable market, we think that those are dynamics that are really helping us be very successful in the generics area.
Holly Weiss: Operator, we have time for one more question.
Operator: Certainly. That question will come from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Your line is open.
Eric Percher: Thank you. A quick one on Europe. Loud and clear on expense reduction and a little benefit from the UK helping the uptick this quarter on op profit. Is it correct that the German business has not been moved to discontinued ops? So, is that still flowing through? And at some point, would we see that a benefit or maybe a loss might be removed from that segment when the JV is struck or approved?
Britt Vitalone: Good morning, Eric. It is true we have not moved it to discontinue operations as it doesn't qualify for discontinued operations. I did talk about a GAAP-only charge that we took in the quarter. And we have the assets as held-for-sale on our balance sheet.
Eric Percher: And can you state anything on whether that is in a loss position?
Britt Vitalone: I'd just go back to my comments in terms of the loss that we reported from a GAAP-only perspective in the quarter of $282 million.
Brian Tyler: Okay. Well, I think that runs us out of time. I want to thank everyone for your great questions and your continued interest in McKesson. I want to thank Jack for facilitating this call.  To conclude, McKesson continued to execute well in the third quarter and we remain confident in our fiscal 2020 outlook. I am extremely proud of how our employees are embracing the team McKesson culture, and I want to thank them for everything they do day in and day out, not only to deliver these results, but most importantly to improve care in every setting we serve.  Thanks again for your interest in McKesson. We will release fourth quarter earnings results in early May. Look forward to talking to you then. Goodbye.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect. And have a great day.

===== 2020 Q2  (2019-10-30 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to McKesson’s Q2 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Holly Weiss. Please go ahead.
Holly Weiss: Thank you, Susan. Good morning, and welcome, everyone, to McKesson's second quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. Today I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off followed by Britt and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, such as forecast about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's press release and our slide presentation and to the risk factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Additional information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results is included in today's press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website at investor.mckesson.com. With that, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Holly. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on our call today. Today, we reported second quarter total company revenues of $57.6 billion. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $3.60, which was in line with our expectations, and when excluding the $0.33 prior year benefit from the reversal of a contractual liability associated with McKesson's investment in Change Healthcare, second quarter results per diluted share increased more than 10% year-over-year. Our first half fiscal 2020 results give us confidence in our reaffirmed fiscal 2020 full-year outlook of $14 to $14.60 of adjusted earnings per diluted share. This continues to reflect year-over-year adjusted operating profit growth in each of our segments. Before I go deeper into our second quarter results, I want to take a few minutes to discuss one topic I know is top of mind for everyone and that is opioid litigation. Last week, McKesson along with two other distributors, reached a collective $215 million settlement with two Ohio Counties, Cuyahoga and Summit in the first track of the multi-district opioid litigation. McKesson's portion of the settlement was $82 million which was recorded in our second quarter results. We strongly dispute the allegations made by these two counties. However, settling the bellwether trial was in our view an important stepping stone to achieving a broad resolution to opioid litigation and to accelerating relief efforts for the people and communities impacted by this public health crisis. Over the next few months, we will be working hard with other parties on the settlement framework that includes States and their subdivisions. While we have made good progress, there are many details and variables that remain open and still needs to be addressed. We are optimistic that a broad resolution can be achieved and that remains our goal. All along, we've said the goal is to ring-fence the risk. However, to the extent the broad resolution settlement framework is unsuccessful; McKesson is prepared and continues to be prepared to litigate and to vigorously defend the mischaracterization that our company drove demand for opioids in this country. The litigation process if necessary will be costly and can take many years to conclude causing a significant and substantial delay to crisis mitigation efforts. I've stated this before, McKesson remains firmly committed to being part of the broader solution to this crisis. And while I appreciate there are many, many questions on this topic, given that discussions are ongoing, we will be somewhat limited in what we can say, and I'm sure you can appreciate this, and we thank you for your understanding. I also want to provide a brief update on our Board of Directors. In mid-October, our Board of Directors welcomed Maria Martinez as a new Independent Director. Maria has served as Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Experience Officer for Cisco since April, 2018. She brings deep experience in customer experience, technology and innovation, which we look forward to benefiting from. Maria's appointment, in addition to Ken Washington joining our Board of Directors in July, demonstrates our continuing commitment to refresh our Board and add valuable expertise and new perspectives. Now let's get to the business results and share why I am so confident in McKesson's positioning and our outlook. If you step back from a macro perspective, trends continue to support growth in healthcare. We have an aging population as well as increase in chronic conditions. We are also seeing growth in innovative specialty medicines. The pipeline is rich with such medicines, including biosimilars. Our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment reflected solid execution in the quarter against this macro backdrop. Branded pricing is tracking in line with our fiscal 2020 assumption of mid-single-digit price increases. For generics, consistent with prior quarters, our ClarusONE Sourcing venture is performing in line with expectations and the sell-side remains competitive, but stable. Independent pharmacies continue to demonstrate resiliency and remain an important customer of McKesson. Recently our McKesson RxOwnership team partnered with the National Community Pharmacist Association to sponsor it's 10th annual Ownership Workshops Series. RxOwnership supports the future of pharmacy ownership by giving pharmacists the knowledge, the support, and the tools required to achieve their ownership goals. In the past year, RXOwnership assisted more than 725 owners in launching a new pharmacy and since 2008, our team aided in the ownership or transfer process of roughly 6,000 community pharmacies. We are proud of the long-term investments we've made in helping independent pharmacies deliver exceptional care to their patients and communities. I am also pleased with the strength we continue to see from our Specialty businesses where we have a broad array of assets and capabilities. When I talk about our Specialty businesses, I'm largely referring to our Provider Solutions and Practice Management businesses that serve the community setting, primarily in oncology, but also in other ologies like ophthalmology, rheumatology and neurology, and our life sciences business that leverage our provider footprint and differentiated services to drive solutions upstream for our manufacturer partners. These businesses are organized in three strategic areas. First, Provider Solutions which is the largest of the three businesses, includes the distribution and GPO services that are core to McKesson and to the needs of our physician customers. Also in this business, we have technology and tools that enhance value-based care delivery and products and services to help expand practice revenue. Next is the practice management business. We discussed the U.S. Oncology Network quite often. This organization supports more than 1,400 physicians across 450 sites of service. We provide a unique value proposition which allows the physician to remain independent, while utilizing McKesson services and staff to ensure the practice is running efficiently and effectively. This allows the physician to focus his or her time on treating patients. McKesson has 15 practices in the U.S. Oncology Network that are participating in the Oncology Care Model or OCM. The centers for Medicaid and Medicaid innovation recently released results for the fourth performance period related to the OCM. I'm pleased to report that all 15 practices earn high marks for quality performance. The practices improved care and provided an enhanced patient experience and also saved Medicare approximately $35 million during the performance period as compared to the established benchmark. We are committed to ensuring that community practices have access to all the resources necessary, including access to clinical trials to successfully accomplish the challenging practice transformation required by the OCM and the other value-based alternative payment models. The third business is our McKesson life sciences business. This business includes third party logistics, specialty pharmacy solutions for oncology and other rare and orphan products, patient access, adherence and affordability solutions, clinical education services, and a suite of data services providing commercial insights and real world evidence. These services help ensure biopharma manufacturers are successful in the post-launch commercialization of their products. These three businesses are well-positioned as innovative specialty products, including biosimilars are coming to the market and McKesson is often the partner of choice throughout the lifecycle of a therapy. As you can see, two of our strategic imperatives, supporting specialty and the manufacturer services value proposition are underpinned by the strong portfolio of our existing offerings. And we consistently look at ways to expand those offerings and create new value-added services for our customers. We are investing in these businesses, specifically in the areas of oncology and biopharma services. We're making these investments in order to further expand our capabilities and support our future growth. Let me turn now to Europe. As a reminder, last quarter in our UK Retail business, we experienced industry-wide underfunding by the NHS. Consistent with our expectations in July, we did see a nominal tariff increase in the month of August. And we do expect a further upward tariff revision later this fiscal year, which should result in a partial recovery of the underfunding we've experienced year-to-date. Outside of the UK, in Europe, we continue to see in aggregate year-to-date performance in line with our expectations for that segment. Britt will discuss our full-year outlook for the segment in a few minutes. A few words on our Medical-Surgical business. We continue to see above market growth as we operate in strong markets and care shifts out of the hospital to alternate sites of care. McKesson has a full range of products and services for our physician, health system, post-acute and home care provider customers. So we can serve their needs comprehensively and our customer benefit from our enterprise mindset as our MedSurg team partners closely with our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions business to ensure physicians received the pharmaceuticals they need to run their practices. This continues to be an area of growth for our business. And the MSD acquisition, which we fully lapped in the first quarter, is on track with its plan integration as we worked to consolidate the business and position ourselves to effectively scale. Turning to the other segment, which primarily consist of Canada, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions or MRxTS and our investment in Change Healthcare. As we evaluate ways to further leverage the scale and expertise of our businesses. In Canada, we've recently streamlined our leadership team structure into a retail and wholesale operations focus. We've introduced two new Senior Vice President Physicians responsible for leading the core operating businesses of retail, which includes digital and loyalty programs and our distribution solutions and specialty health business in Canada. This strategic change will enable our Canadian operations to work even better together as we deepen relationships with manufacturers and retail partners and drive real value for patients. I believe we have the right talent to move the Company forward and contribute to a better healthcare system for all Canadians. Moving on to MRxTS. The business continues to show strong growth in both new and existing products. In addition, our CoverMyMeds business, which is focused on electronic prior authorization, continues to innovate across the organization. During the quarter, CoverMyMeds and RxCrossroads by McKesson announced the launch of AMP, which stands for Access for More Patients, a first-in-class technology driven patient support solution that transforms how patients access afford and adhere to their medications. This collaboration brings together the robust technology platform and established provider network of CoverMyMeds with the deep specialty experience and commercialization expertise of RxCrossroads by McKesson and is designed to automate access to specialty medications for physicians and patients. The traditional hub model has had complex requirements and in many times relied on time consuming manual processes, which typically delay treatment sometimes significantly. In our pilot case study, McKesson's AMP solution enabled patients across the U.S. to access their specialty medications 27% faster than traditional hub programs. Fundamentally improving the way patient support is provided. AMP also provides high-touch services for patient cases that need intervention support beyond the automated technology platform, such as proactive clinical support, behavioral coaching and financial assistance, improving adherence and helping to support better outcomes for patients. We're very excited about this cross collaboration as it again exemplifies our mission to improve patient care by providing innovative offerings and demonstrates the value of our McKesson team and our broad set of capabilities. This represents another example of how we're investing in our differentiated businesses. Let's move on to Change Healthcare. Our value-creating transaction with Change Healthcare provided McKesson with a cash payment upfront that allowed us to retain 70% ownership of the new company. It created a scaled healthcare, software and analytics, and technology enabled services company that will unlock the value of our legacy MTS businesses. We have begun activities to exit the investment in the next 6 months to 12 months in a tax efficient manner. This drove certain charges that impacted our results for the second quarter. Britt will walk you through these accounting details later in the call. In the Change Healthcare transaction, we found a way to create value while exiting businesses that weren't core to our McKesson strategy. It's a great example of how McKesson regularly evaluates our portfolio to ensure we have the right set of assets for the present, but also for the future. I'm very pleased by the execution across our businesses in the second quarter. That execution included the impact of our cost savings initiatives across the enterprise. Britt will get into more of the details, but I think from my remarks you can see evidence of not only the savings efforts, but the partnership across the businesses and overall cultural change happening across the organization. For example, we centralize our IT organization, implementing a center-led hub model to increase efficiency. In MedSurg, I talked about the partnership with U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment to ensure physicians receive the pharmaceuticals they need to run their practice in an easy way. And in MRxTS, I talked about the partnership with RxCrossroads business to launch AMP. Overall, we're evolving behaviors as it relates to company collaboration and spending and are focused on moving with speed in an ever-changing healthcare landscape. We're building upon our strong culture, leveraging our diverse perspective to make decisions with an enterprise first team McKesson mindset. I feel confident in the execution I've seen across our businesses in the first half of fiscal 2020 and I feel great about the future of McKesson. And with that, let me turn the call over to Britt to go over the financials and some of the details I alluded to. Britt?
Britt Vitalone: Thanks, Brian, and good morning. I'll begin with a few comments in second quarter results, including changes to our guidance for you to consider as you update your models. We were pleased with our adjusted earnings per diluted share results in the second quarter, which were in line with consensus and grew 10% over the prior year when excluding a one-time $90 million benefit in FY 2019. Our performance to the first half of fiscal 2020 was solid, and we are pleased with the momentum across the business and we're reiterating our fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings outlook of $14 to $14.60 per diluted share. Updated guidance assumptions can be found in our second quarter earnings slides posted to the investors section of our website. Before we get into the details of the results, I want to address two items that impacted our GAAP only results. First, we've concluded it’s the appropriate time to exit our remaining stake in Change Healthcare and we begun activities expected to lead to an exited the investment, which we anticipate will occur within the next 6 months to 12 months. As we previously communicated, we will execute this transaction in a tax efficient manner and we expect that this transaction will continue to deliver value to McKesson's shareholders. We believe that this transaction better positions McKesson to focused on its core set of businesses. As part of this work, we completed a market value assessment and recorded a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $1.2 billion in our fiscal 2020 second quarter. It's important to note this charge in no way reflects the future value of Change Healthcare. Rather, it's an adjustment of the book value to the current market value from one of the necessary accounting activities within the planned exit process. Overall, the Change Healthcare transaction has been and continues to be value creating from McKesson's shareholders. Second, as Brian mentioned earlier, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $82 million after settling all claims against McKesson and the suits filed by Cuyahoga and Summit counties of Ohio in the first track of the multi-district opioid litigation. Moving to the adjusted earnings results for the quarter. On Slide 3 of the presentation, our second quarter adjusted earnings of $3.60 per diluted share was flat year-over-year. As a reminder in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, McKesson recorded a $90 million or $0.33 per diluted share pretax benefit related to the reversal of contractual liability associated with our investment in Change Healthcare. Excluding this one-time item, second quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 10% driven by a lower share count and growth in the Medical-Surgical and Prescription Technology or MRxTS businesses. Year-to-date, adjusted earnings per diluted share was $6.91, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Excluding the previously mentioned one-time benefit in FY2019, year-to-date adjusted earnings per diluted share grew 12% year-over-year. Moving to the details of our consolidated results on Slide 4. Consolidated revenues for the quarter increased 9% year-over-year, due to higher than anticipated growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions Segment in part related to increase Caremark volumes associated with the on-boarding of a new customer. Taking this into account, we are updating our consolidated revenues guidance from low-to-mid single-digit growth to mid-to-high single-digit percentage growth year-over-year. Adjusted gross profit increased 2% year-over-year or 3% on an FX adjusted basis, mainly driven by strong Primary Care pharmaceutical volumes within our Medical-Surgical segment, continued growth in our Specialty Providers Solutions business within our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions Segment, and growth across our existing MRxTS offerings, principally within our electronic prior authorization products. Second quarter adjusted operating expenses increased 5% year-over-year. Excluding the prior year $90 million contractual liability reversal, operating expenses increased 2.5% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis. Adjusted income from operations before tax was $859 million for the quarter, 6% below the prior year. However, excluding the one-time prior year $90 million benefit, adjusted income from operations before tax increased 4%. Interest expense was $64 million for the quarter, a decrease of 3% compared to the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate was 17% for the quarter, which included discrete tax benefits of approximately $31 million, and we continue to assume a full-year adjusted tax rate of approximately 18% to 19%, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter and includes anticipated discrete tax items that we expect to realize in the back half of the fiscal year. During the quarter, we completed $750 million of share repurchases and our diluted weighted-average shares outstanding were $184 million for the quarter, a decrease of 8% year-over-year. As a result of share repurchase activity this year, we're updating our guidance to diluted weighted-average shares of approximately $184 million for the year. Moving now to our segment results, which can be found on Slides 6 through 9. I'll start with U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions. Second quarter revenues were $46 billion, up 10% year-over-year driven by branded pharmaceutical price increases and the previously mentioned increase in Caremark volumes, which were largely specialty products and were partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Based on the revenue development in the first half of the fiscal year, we are updating our guidance to revenue growth of high single-digits. Segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter increased 1% year-over-year to $641 million due to continued growth in our Specialty businesses led by the Provider Solutions business, partially offset by customer and product mix, which includes the new customer volumes that are flowing through Caremark. Year-to-date, segment adjusted operating profit growth is 6%. As Brian discussed, we have differentiated assets and capabilities in the areas of oncology and manufacturer services. As such, we will be investing an incremental $25 million in the second half of the year to extend these leading positions. Inclusive of these additional investments, we are reiterating our adjusted operating profit guidance of low-to-mid single-digit percent growth for the full-year. Next, European Pharmaceutical Solutions. Second quarter revenues were down 1% year-over-year to $6.6 billion. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues grew 4% in line with our original expectations, driven by market growth in the Pharmaceutical Distribution business. Segment adjusted operating profit was down 23% to $41 million. On an FX adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit was $43 million, down 19% due to continued weakness in the UK retail pharmacy environment. As Brian mentioned, we are expecting partial recovery of the underfunding we experienced year-to-date by the NHS, and while we continue to anticipate improvement in the second half of fiscal 2020, we are however, updating our full-year guidance for Europe. Our updated revenue guidance is flat to low single-digit percentage decline and adjusted operating profit growth in the low single-digits. Moving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Second quarter revenues were $2.1 billion, up 6% year-over-year driven by growth in pharmaceutical volumes within our Primary Care business. Segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter increased 20% to $166 million, primarily reflecting the previously mentioned organic growth and the lapping of $8 million of bad debt expense in the prior year. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 807 basis points an increase of 99 basis points, driven by organic growth and lapping of prior year bad debt expense. And finishing our business review with Other revenues were $3 billion for the quarter, up 4% year-over-year due to organic growth in the Canadian Wholesale business and higher volumes of our prior authorization products within the Prescription Technology or MRxTS business. Our original revenue guidance for Other, reflected the anticipated exit of an unprofitable customer in our Canadian business at the onset of the fiscal year. This transition has been delayed and as a result, we are updating revenue guidance for Other to grow low single-digits in fiscal 2020. Other adjusted operating profit decreased 26% to $221 million driven by the prior year $90 million contractual liability reversal and lower contribution from our investment and Change Healthcare, partially offset by higher transaction volumes in our MRxTS business, principally from our electronic prior authorization products and growth in our Canadian Wholesale business. Excluding the prior year $90 million contractual liability reversal, Other adjusted operating profit grew 5% versus the prior year. And we continue to expect adjusted operating profits to be down low-to-mid single-digits. Year-to-date, our adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $147 million and we continue to anticipate the adjusted equity earnings from our investment in Change Healthcare in fiscal 2020 to be in the range of $250 million to $270 million. Moving now to corporate expenses. McKesson recorded a $146 million in adjusted corporate expenses in the second quarter, an increase of 2% compared to the prior year, resulting from planned investments in technology. McKesson recorded $36 million in opioid-related litigation expenses in the second quarter and $72 million year-to-date. We continue to assume opioid-related litigation costs to be approximately $150 million in fiscal 2020. Based on the progress against our cost initiative program and the anticipated timing of planned technology investments, we are updating our corporate expense guidance through range of $695 million to $745 million for the year. Turning now to cash, which can be found on Slide 10. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.4 billion. For the first half of fiscal 2020, McKesson used a $159 million in cash flow from operations. We used $184 million for internal capital investment, resulting in negative free cash flow of $343 million. For the first half of the fiscal year, McKesson also paid $95 million per acquisition and we returned $1.6 billion to our shareholders through the repurchase of $1.4 billion in common stock and payment of $148 million in dividends. Finally, I would remind you that our working capital metrics and results in cash flow maybe impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of a given quarter. I would also remind you we typically generate the majority of our annual operating cash flow in the second half of the fiscal year with more than $3 billion generated in each of the past two years. In fiscal 2020, we continue to expect internal capital investments of between $500 million and $700 million and free cash flow of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. Our disciplined approach to capital deployment is committed to maintaining our investment grade rating, which underpins our financial flexibility and delivering value and returns to our shareholders. Before I wrap up, we are updating our guidance around the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movement to a net unfavorable impact of up to $0.05 per diluted share year-over-year. And in terms of fiscal 2020 earnings progression, we continue to expect that the fourth quarter will be our largest in terms of EPS contribution similar to prior years and the first half earnings progression is compared to the second half will be similar to FY2019. Let me take a minute to update you on the optimization of our operating model and cost structure. Our cost program is called [Venn Smart]. This emphasizes that everyone in the organization must think like an owner and that we will leverage the scale of the enterprise. We are seeing good progress in reducing costs via competitive and lean operator. As we've stated previously, we expected a portion of these savings will flow through profit, as evidenced by our lower corporate expense guide and overall operating expense results, and a portion will be reinvested in growth, such as the investments I discussed earlier in oncology, in manufacturer services. Additionally, we are on track to successfully transition several business unit functional and back office services to a more centralized hub model, allowing us to further increase standardization, gain efficiencies and drive focus to our customers. We've already made great progress in transforming finance and IT and we've seen tangible results from our investments in technology, more specifically data and analytics, and we're confident that our focus in this area will unlock additional benefits. The collective efforts and focus of our associates across the enterprise have resulted in meaningful savings for the organization. In closing, we are encouraged by the continued positive momentum across our businesses through the first half of fiscal 2020, led by the focus and execution of our associates across the enterprise. As a result, we are reiterating our fiscal 2020 outlook of adjusted earnings per diluted share of $14 to $14.60. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interested time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Percher of Nephron Research. Your line is open.
Eric Percher: Thank you. Maybe to begin, it's hard to disaggregate the underlying gross margin trend and for pharma in particular given what has gone on in the EU. Can you give us some perspective on what gross margin is doing and maybe gross margin and absolute gross profit?
Britt Vitalone: Yes. Hey Eric. Thanks for that question. As we talked about, we had significant growth in revenues in the quarter. And as I mentioned, specifically in our U.S. Pharma and Specialty Solutions business, we had growth that caused us to raise our guidance for the full-year. And I also pointed to the fact that a great portion of that came from specialty products and in particular from the growth of Caremark through growth of new customers there. And that had an impact on our gross profit rate in terms of comparing that to our revenue growth. We did have a 1% impact from foreign exchange. So when you looked at our gross profit, 3% when you exclude the impact of foreign exchange. But I would point you back to the fact that our revenue grew faster than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. It's largely coming from the onboarding of some customer wins through Caremark and there's a customer and product mix aspect to that where the products are largely coming through specialty products. And that's really what's driving that delta between revenue growth and gross profit growth.
Eric Percher: In an absolute basis, you're seeing growth from specialty and is it also reasonable to expect that given the stability you speak to in the generic marketplace and given sourcing that we're seeing generic profitability grow on an absolute basis?
Britt Vitalone: Yes. Eric, we are seeing that. As Brian talked about, we continue to see great benefits coming from our ClarusONE Sourcing organization. We're able to generate a good savings there this year. We're seeing stability on the sell-side and that's allowing us to continue to create a spread from a generic perspective. In our Specialty businesses, Brian, I think talked a lot about our provider business, our advances that we have in manufacturer services, and the lead that we have in from a U.S. Oncology as an asset. But we're seeing a lot of growth that is coming through our full line wholesale distribution. And as I mentioned, that's particularly coming from the growth of large customers like Caremark.
Eric Percher: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Lisa Gill: Great. Thank you. Good morning. Brian, I just wanted to go back to your comments around the opioid litigation and settlement. If I do the math, 38% of the settlement was McKesson. Should I think about that that was the market share in those two counties, or do you anticipate just given your overall market share with the independence in the U.S. that if we think about any settlement, it would be, somewhere in that type of range on a percentage basis?
Brian Tyler: Good morning, Lisa. Thank you for the question. You did your math correct. We were 38% of that settlement. Obviously, there is data in the marketplace, the ARCOS data in particular that many of you are aware and familiar with. That data can be cut lots of ways depending on how you look at time periods, and how you look at customer segments, and whether you consider doses, et cetera, et cetera. And so part of the discussions that we had to go through was a methodology and we landed on a data-based methodology, and so you can roughly think of 38% as the McKesson representation of “our share”.
Lisa Gill: Okay. That's helpful. And then just as we think about the timeline of this. I know you said that you're prepared to defend and litigate if needed. My understanding is that the next court cases until some time next summer. So does that mean that that kind of gives you this time between now and then for a settlement? And any update that you can give us on where you are on a potential global settlement? Because if I remember correctly, I think that's what you've talked about in the past, right. Ring-fencing those and having a global settlement not doing these one-off…
Brian Tyler: Yes. That's right. Thank you, Lisa. I mean our objective and priority continues to be, we'll call it, sometimes global resolution or ring-fencing and that remains our priority. Our view on these two counties and coming to the settlement agreement we did with them was that that was an important stepping stone or building block or momentum for those, for the more global discussions to progress. And so we're encouraged by the status of the discussions. There is a lot of activity and things that we need to continue to work through, and we are actively working through those. We're working through those with some urgency. But it will take a bit of time to get through those. We're talking about 50 States and we're talking about subdivisions within States. So we've got a framework that we're very optimistic about. The teams are working diligently to address the issues. We'll progress it as quickly as we can, but obviously, we contemplate the two paths we've always talked about. There's a path to litigate, which only can project amount of time and amount of dollars to go down that path. And then there is a path that we think ring-fence is a risk and give us other resolution that it will take the path that we think is most beneficial for our shareholders. We certainly are anxious to find a resolution that takes care of the patients in the communities they serve as quickly as they can. But as we pursue these discussions, we continue to invest in our defense and we think it's only prudent to do that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brian Tanquilut: Brian, just as I think about your comments about the trends that you saw with the medical side on the primary care physician offices and new supply, how are you strategizing? Or how are you thinking about the emergence of retail-based client care delivery in the primary care side, whether that's Walmart who's your client obviously, or the competitors in the retail space?
Brian Tyler: Yes. Great. Thank you for the question. Maybe to frame it my answer a little bit, I'll go back in time. I think the medical business has been very successful at following the emergence of new channels in the alternate site settings. At one point in time that was urgent care clinics. We have a large footprint in the retail-based clinics that are out there today. And so we think as these new models for community-based care emerge, the solutions that we have in the medical business are right on point for the needs that those businesses and services will have. So my view is that's just a continued evolution in a new segment and our team has proven quite adept and quite effective at evolving our capabilities, and really leading the way as these segments emerge. And I would expect that's what the team is focused on today.
Brian Tanquilut: And then I guess just my follow-up for Britt. As I think about calendar 2020, is there – what are your expectations in terms of brand pricing, just for 1-1?
Britt Vitalone: Yes. What I would say is that we're reiterating our view that brand price inflations mid single-digit. We don't see anything that has occurred on the first half of the year or this quarter that would change that expectation. So we're continuing to view brand price – in the mid single-digits. Obviously, January is a usually an important month historically. But at this point, we're not changing our view on branded price inflation.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Baxter of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Stephen Baxter: Hi. Thanks for the question. So I'm trying to understand the magnitude of the revenue revision in the U.S. Pharma business. Now I appreciate the color on Caremark, but it sounds like you're suggesting this is coming in a lot better than expected levels. So I guess first, can you help us understand why that is? And then I guess the follow-up will be you're raising revenue guidance here by what looks like roughly 3% to 5%, but not changing your EBIT growth outlook. I get that we're talking about specialty and Caremark, but surprising there isn't really any noticeable drop due to earn ins. So, I guess how should we be thinking about that and is there something about the rest of the business, we should be keeping in mind? Thanks.
Britt Vitalone: Yes. Thanks for that question. So let me just step back to the revenue guidance. Our prior revenue guidance was low single-digit to mid single-digit. And so we've updated that to high single-digit, and that's largely reflective of the growth that we're seeing that's coming from Caremark and particularly, Specialty products that are going through that customer. That's really what's driving this. In terms of the drop due to the bottom line. We're really pleased that we're able to make investments in the business. I talked about $25 million of investments in our oncology and manufacturer services capabilities. And despite those investments, we're pleased to be able to hold and then affirm our guidance for the segment on AOP at that low single- to mid single-digit number. So I would call this as a growth from one of our customers that is primarily coming through Specialty. We're making investments where we have leading positions and great capabilities and I talked about that as being an additional $25 million, but we're still holding and affirming the AOP guide or the segment.
Stephen Baxter: Got it. And I guess just coming back to – like what is better than was expected going into the year? Is there any clarity you can provide on that? I appreciate what the driver is in absolute terms, but understanding what is prior expectation would be great? Thanks.
Britt Vitalone: Sure. Well, I'd just reiterate a couple things that branded price inflation is performing as we had anticipated. We're seeing really good progress out of ClarusONE and so our – from a generic perspective, everything is performing as we had anticipated, still stable competitive marketplace. I think a couple of things that I would point out that Brian really talked about is our Specialty Provider business is performing quite well. And certainly the investments that we've been making in our manufacturer services capabilities and that we're continuing to make there, that’s also performing well. So I think as you think about our Specialty business, we're getting a lot of growth through customer wins in our Wholesale Distribution business. We're making great advances in our Provider business and our manufacturer services capabilities.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Michael Cherny: Thanks so much for taking the question. So I wanted to go back to the comment you made, Brian, about the stability of what you're seeing on the sell side relative to generics. And now it's been about three years since we had a shift in the independent market, you also highlighted some of the value that you provide in terms of the independent customers. And so I guess as we go forward, how do you think about the activity and the kind of – the puts and takes that go on with the independent market, and how they think about negotiating, especially as they all tend to get into their own specific buying groups?
Brian Tyler: Yes, sure. Thank you. Thank you for the question. I mean I referenced in my comments the RxOwnership program and the fact that 700-ish pharmacy – new pharmacy owners, we helped in opening or establishing or transferring into the business. And that's not a unusual number. I mean if you go back many, many years, we often see lots of exits, in the Independent Pharmacy segment. Some of those are family planning and transition exit. Some are script file sales, but we also see as many new – as many new openings or many new storefronts come into play. And so it's been remarkably stable over the years. And that trend we continue to see today. And we do, over the years we have and we continue to invest in these tools and these services that we think help independent pharmacists stay independent, stay healthy businesses and stay vibrant in the communities and the patients that we serve. But we really haven't seen anything that I would say was a massive trend break in terms of there's always ins and there's always outs in the Independent segment.
Michael Cherny: Thanks. And then just one quick question on capital deployments, as you think about the discussions and debates going on relative to the push for a global settlement? Does that have any impact on your cash availability or capital deployment priorities? And I know not from a reserving perspective per say, but do you think about keeping some level of cash to present itself for any type of potential settlements?
Brian Tyler: I would say this. I think we've been pretty clear on what our capital deployment philosophy has been in the past, a very balanced approach to that. What I would say is we have not made a change to that for that portfolio approach. We continue to make investments internally that we think will drive future growth. We continue to be open to M&A, where we can find that the M&A that makes sense, balancing obviously valuation expectations, where our share prices, what alternate returns of that capital are. But that was a long answer to give you the short answer that we really – it really has not impacted our approach to capital deployment.
Britt Vitalone: And I think if you look at how we've deployed capital in the first half of the year, it's pretty historical amount of capital that's been deployed. We've returned a lot of capital to our shareholders, particularly in the second quarter. And as Brian mentioned, we'll continue to evaluate, really on a balanced perspective. But we haven't made any changes to the amount or how we're deploying capital at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee of Cowen. Your line is open.
Charles Rhyee: Yes. Hey, thanks for getting the questions. So I just wanted to go back, Brian, about the framework here. You're optimistic about in terms of getting sort of more global kind of settlement here. Just to clarify, with this any kind of discussions, is it clear to you that you’ve encompass all point us you might have mentioned, I just didn't catch that clearly.
Brian Tyler: You were breaking up a little bit. Let me – I think the question was, coming back to the framework, is it going to be all encompassing of all the litigation. And what I would say is that relative to the States and relative to the subdivisions in those States, our goal is to get as comprehensive of a settlement within that framework as we can. And that is the majority of the outstanding litigation. But it is not all of the cases.
Charles Rhyee: Is that something mechanically that, you kind of reach this framework and then wait for all the parties to then look at it and say, we're okay with this. And that sort of – and if there's some type of from your standpoint and you kind of look at them and thanks. This is enough that we will move forward or not enough and we will not agree to this because it's maybe you might have thought, some large percentage, we're okay with that. But in the end, a lot of them subdivisions say, this is not – we're not satisfied with this. And in this case you go to the - different tracks?
Brian Tyler: Yes. So I guess that the easiest way to answer that is to say that, this is a complex legal situation. We have established a framework and had good discussion around that framework. It is very much a process though, and we are very much working through the details of how that process will unfold. And it's really not a lot more I can add to it at this time.
Charles Rhyee: Okay. Very good. And Britt, just a follow-up one real quick question on the European segment from the guidance. Is it that you’re still looking for operating profit guidance to low single-digit and really size heavy back half maybe a little bit more thoughts on what's going to get there in the back half? Thanks.
Britt Vitalone: Yes, thanks for the question. I think as we've talked about, we expect that the business will continue to improve its performance in the back half, and then Brian also talked about some nominal increases in the tariffs in the UK. And we would expect that there could be additional increases in the back half of the year. So that's really what is driving that second half performance.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Your line is open.
Steven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question here. So I guess this has been touched on a little bit, I guess I'm looking for any update on the ClarusONE progress and tied into that, based on a little bit of the margin compression in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty business, should we assume that the relationship between the procurement price on generics versus your sell-side pricing, it may have fallen off a little bit during the quarter or in your mind, was that relationship still relatively consistent during the quarter? Thanks.
Brian Tyler: Yes. Thanks for that question. We're really pleased with the performance of ClarusONE and it's performing in line with what our expectations were at the beginning of the year. We're continuing to see that organization drive great value, which is very helpful. As we think about the sell-side, which is – as we've talked about now for several quarters. So competitive, but stable environment. We're pleased with ClarusONE. It’s performing as we had anticipated. We think that there's still great value to be gained out of that organization. And we were pleased with the partnership that we have with our partner Walmart as we continue through – in that relationship as well.
Steven Valiquette: Okay. And what about the relationship then between the buy-side versus the sell-side pricing? Was that consistent during the quarter or was there some slight erosion? Just curious to – just a high level comment on that.
Brian Tyler: Yes, sure. No, I say it's consistent. We're seeing consistency over the last several quarters now and again, a good performance on ClarusONE in a stable competitive environment on the sell-side, and that's in line with our expectations and what we've seen now for the several quarters.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Bob Jones of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Robert Jones: Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess just a couple to go back to Specialty, Brian, if I could. You discussed the three main areas within Specialty, it sounds like generally very pleased with the performance across the board there. And I think most of us get the mixed dynamic that you guys have discussed within Specialty Pharmacy and Caremark, specifically. But I guess if we take a step back, the operating profit for the overall Pharma and Specialty segment was up 1% in the quarter. Just sounds like there's a lot of secular tailwinds there. So I guess just wondering if you could shed a little bit more light on how you think about overall EBIT growth as it relates specifically to what seems like some pretty strong tailwinds within specialty?
Brian Tyler: Yes. Great. Thank you. And we reflected on the questions we've had over the last few quarters and that's why we included a little more description or color on the Specialty businesses that we have in the Pharmaceutical Solutions segment. And if you think about the three segments we highlighted, they are all performing very well. And we think in all cases, we have assets that are not only competitive with the market, but probably one of the most robust set of solutions and services when taken in the aggregate. And so those businesses are continuing to perform well. They're delivering good growth and they're performing right in line with where we thought they would for the year. Obviously, there is another segment in specialty that is the more retail mail order oriented specialty products. And Britt talked a lot about the impact we've seen of the growth in the Caremark book of business that has been – the mix has been slanted towards those specialty products, which tends to be the lower margin profile for us. So when you net all out, that's where you get – that's how you get to the results that you're seeing today.
Robert Jones: And then I guess just to follow-up on that, maybe Britt. I mean, just to maybe understand that a little bit better. I mean these kind of outsized growth within Caremark products. I mean these aren't margin or EBID dilutive I guess I would say. And then just on the $25 million investment that you mentioned in the back half, maybe just a little bit more specificity around what area within specialty those would be pointed out would be helpful too. Thanks.
Britt Vitalone: Yes, as we've talked about before and as we think about specialty distribution in our wholesale – line of wholesale business, they do have a dilutive impact on the rate. We still participate in the profit dollars. It's just grown a lot faster than we had anticipated and that's at a much more dilutive impact on the rate of growth. As we think about the investments that we're making as Brian talked about, we are very pleased with our positions in oncology, our positions that we're developing in manufacturer services, and as we think about this $25 million, it will be largely invested in oncology capabilities and assets. But again, we're continuing to invest in our manufacturing services capabilities as well. But you should think about this investment as investing where we have leading-edge positions and oncology is certainly one of those.
Brian Tyler: Yes. Just to build on that. I mean, these investments are tied to our strategy. Our strategy is anchored and where we typically – we have differentiated capabilities and we have good marketplace growth. And so we're very happy to be able to say we're continuing to make these investments and still delivering on the year as we committed.
Holly Weiss: Operator, we have time for one more.
Operator: Okay, great. Our last question for today is Kevin Caliendo of UBS. Your line is open.
Kevin Caliendo: Hi. Thanks for getting me in guys. I appreciate that. If we think about the CVS relationship in the fact that it was just sort of re-upped for June, is there some anticipation that over time the margin with them could get better, meaning like are we in a situation right now where the first sort of 12 months of this relationship, the margins from that contract might be worse and over time they could get better?
Brian Tyler: Well, first let me say, we are always happy to renew our customers and we're always happy when they grow. We are experiencing a shift in the mix of business – on our margin rate perspective as you see in our results, I mean great topline growth, but there is a margin rate impact in there. We're never disappointed when our customers grow and we think it's always additive to the business.
Kevin Caliendo: One quick follow-up. Can you talk about the performance and impact NorthStar would have had in the quarter?
Brian Tyler: We don't specifically talk about NorthStar, but when we think about our generics portfolio, NorthStar is obviously a critical part of that and we're very pleased with the performance of NorthStar, and we're pleased with the progress that we're making there.
Britt Vitalone: I think the relationships with the manufacturers in NorthStar have really evolved over the years that are quite productive, and I think that's what's supporting the success that we're seeing there.
Brian Tyler: Okay. Well, thank you everyone for your questions, and thanks again for your interest in giving us some of your time this morning. Thank you, Suzanne, for facilitating this call. Just maybe to conclude, I really think the fundamentals inside the business were strong. The macro healthcare environment is supporting a stable market. We executed well in the second quarter. I'm very proud of the teams and the execution. We're continuing to drive cost savings. We're continuing to speed up our decision making. We're continuing to make investments where we think we have opportunities for growth, and I feel good about our fiscal 2020 full-year outlook. My confidence is of course, rooted in the 80,000 employees that come to work every day for McKesson for our shareholders, really embodying our values, including integrity. They do the right thing and our execution and success are a direct result of their contribution. So I want to say thank you to them. None of this is possible without you. And now let me hand the call over to Holly for review of our upcoming events. Holly?
Holly Weiss: Thank you, Brian. We will participate in the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco in mid-January and we will release third quarter earnings results in late January. Thank you, and goodbye.
Operator: And thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

===== 2020 Q1  (2019-07-31 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the McKesson Q1 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Holly Weiss. Please go ahead.
Holly Weiss: Thank you, Justin. Good afternoon, and welcome everyone to McKesson's first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, such as forecast about McKesson's operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's press release and our slide presentation, and to the risk factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Additional information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results is included in today's press release and presentation slides, and is also available on our Web site at investor.mckesson.com. With that, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Holly, and thanks to everyone for joining us on our call today. We're please today to be able to report a strong start to our fiscal year 2020. For the first quarter, we achieved total company revenues in excess of $55 billion, and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.31, ahead of our original expectations. On our fourth quarter call, in May, I discussed that we were entering the fiscal year with positive momentum. And I feel really good about this underpinning our first quarter results. We're seeing healthy growth across many parts of our business, which is a direct result of the actions we have been and are taking to execute on our strategic imperatives, which are enabling us to become a more focused and efficient company. And our balance sheet remains strong, giving us the flexibility to deploy capital that can differentiate McKesson and create shareholder value. As a result of our first quarter performance, combined with our confidence in the business as we look ahead, we're raising our fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range to $14.00 to $14.60. This is from our previous range of $13.85 to $14.45. Now turning to the business, I'll summarize our first quarter results, and then turn the call over to Britt to elaborate. The U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions had a good start to the year, driven by our broad set of specialty biopharmaceutical capabilities focused on both providers and manufacturers. I'm particularly pleased as this demonstrates the progress we're making on one of our three key strategic imperatives. We continue to see biopharma dynamics that are trending in line with our annual guide of mid single-digit price increases on branded drugs. In addition, given our presence in the provider space and particularly oncology, where we are well positioned as biosimilars continue to become prevalent. Talking about generics for a moment, similar to the last few quarters, our ClarusONE sourcing platform continues to deliver yield in line with our expectations. With its scale, we're able to buy at prices that are competitive with our peers. On the sell side, we continue to see a market that is competitive but stable. A few comments on Europe, our U.K. retail business performance was impacted primarily by temporary wide NHS underfunding which we believe should improve in the second-half, and to a lesser extent volume weakness. Performance in the other European countries was not enough to fully offset these challenges. Britt will speak to the expected full-year impact. Before I address the NHS more specifically, let me remind you of the actions we're previously taken in the U.K. and across Europe to reposition the business for long-term profitability. With new leadership at the helm, we're making solid progress towards further rationalizing our store footprint and streamlining our back office functions. And we continue to evaluate our cost structure as we do in all our businesses. Turning back to the NHS, we're pleased by recent announcements, first, to increase the retail tariff, beginning in August. And we would expect to see further upward revisions in tariff later in the year, which should make up partially for any underfunding. The NHS also announced the new five-year Community Pharmacy Contractual Framework. This framework brings greater clarity and long-term certainty by maintaining the current level of industry funding for community pharmacies for the next five years. While certain elements of the funding allocation are yet to be fully defined and could evolve over the five-year time horizon, we view this as an incrementally positive development for our European business. McKesson remains active in its support of and direct discussions with the U.K. government on the future of community pharmacy and healthcare in the U.K. Turning to MedSurg, our Medical-Surgical business continues to generate above-market strong organic growth with its focus on delivering care and low-cost patient setting, and we have now lapped the Medical Specialties Distributor or MSD acquisition, which is delivering results in line with our expectations. We saw good growth across multiple markets and product categories, including Lab, Pharmaceutical, and McKesson Private Label. The non-acute space continues to be an encouraging area for us. Like others in healthcare, we continue to see care shift to these non-acute settings where we currently operate. With investments such as MSD and our new technology in our distribution centers, we're continuing to expand our services to these providers and to their patients. Turning to the other segment, which primarily consists of Canada, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions or MRxTS, and our investment in Change Healthcare, we see improving prescription trends in our owned Canadian retail business which reflects our focus on the retail customer experience. We've made investments in people and in reconfigured pharmacy formats. With strengthening fundamentals, we believe this can reinforce the role that community pharmacy plays in Canadian healthcare. Within MRxTS, we continue to see good growth in CoverMyMeds and the RelayHealth Pharmacy, driven by unique technology offerings that resonate with both our retail and biopharma partners. We continue to make investments in this business to position us for future growth. Change Healthcare achieved an important milestone with the completion of its initial public offering, in June. Britt will speak more about this and what we can expect going forward. We're also investing in platforms that enhance our data and analytics capabilities. We realized benefits across the enterprise in the first quarter, and we expect to see expanding benefit in the future. I now want to touch upon drug pricing reform and the policy landscape. I had the opportunity recently to spend a few days in Washington, D.C. McKesson continues to engage as a key stakeholder in educating policymakers to address issues that may impact patients, our industry, and community-based pharmacy and medical practices, and helping to drive the necessary change to support access, quality, and affordability for a sustainable healthcare system. These objectives align with the administration's goals, and we're committed to continuing the dialogue with policymakers and industry partners on sound, sustainable, and pragmatic solutions. It remains a dynamic environment, yet we remain confident in McKesson's path forward. The critical role of the services we provide to the healthcare industry today, and our ability to identify and apply solutions to address the most pressing challenges to the healthcare system globally. Let me address two of the most recent developments. The Senate Finance Committee published a package of measures last week. We anticipate there might be further modifications as the package makes its way through the legislative process. So at this point we're not in a position to go into great detail on specific provisions. However, we will continue to engage with policymakers and industry partners to ensure that these reforms support the efficiency, sustainability, and security of the supply chain as we seek to improve cost, quality, and access. Finally, earlier today, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, announced a Safe Importation Action Plan. Given how recent this announcement is we haven't yet had the full time we'd like to digest or study this plan, but maybe a few just quick preliminary thoughts. Obviously McKesson's presence in both U.S. and Canada gives us a unique perspective on supply chain considerations and the impact to stakeholders and patients as we navigate this complex question of importation. There are legitimate concerns that importation could potentially introduce counterfeit or fraudulent products into the U.S. Importantly, we have a primary responsibility to maintain a safe, secure, and efficient supply chain, and to ensure that we confirm to FDA safety and efficacy standards in addition to the safeguards put in place by the 2013 passage of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act. These objectives are paramount as we evaluate the two pathways announced in today's plan. Before I wrap up, I'd like to spend a couple of minutes on the opioid epidemic. We continue to believe distributors are being disproportionally targeted given our important but limited role in the supply chain. Filling orders from licensed pharmacies who are in turn filling prescriptions written by licensed healthcare providers, any suggestion that McKesson drove demand for opioids in this country would reflect a fundamental misunderstanding and mischaracterization of our role as a distributor. We will continue to fight that mischaracterization in the multiple venues, both state and federal, where lawsuits have been filed by thousands of plaintiffs. These are clearly novel, complex, and unprecedented claims that must be navigated. We remain deeply concerned about the impact of this crisis on families and communities across the U.S., and are passionately committed to using McKesson's capabilities to be part of the solutions. This includes partnering with government, industry, social institutions, and other players to help bring this crisis to an end. I've spoken about it before, but let me remind you of the investments we've made and continue to make in our programs, our processes, our technologies dedicated to preventing diversion, and our corporate initiatives, announced last spring, to help [technical difficulty] the epidemic. Those include educating the pharmacies and hospital to whom we deliver about the importance of compliance with the EA Regulation, creating a nationwide clinical alerts system that uses patient prescription history to identify patients at risk of opioid overuse, abuse, addiction or misuse, and actively advocating for public policies that will help address the opioid epidemic. In addition, we contributed $100 million to establish the foundation for opioid response efforts a foundation dedicated solely to driving solutions to the epidemic. I'm proud of our teams and our team members who ensure the safety and security of our supply chain day-in day-out. With that, let me turn the call over to Britt.
Britt Vitalone: Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon. McKesson posted another solid quarter and strong start to fiscal 2020. Slides on reviewing with you this afternoon are posted to the Investors section of our website and include our full-year fiscal 2020 guidance assumptions. Today we reported first quarter adjusted earnings of $3.31 per diluted share ahead of our original expectations and we're raising the full-year fiscal '20 outlook by $0.15 to a range of $14 to $14.60 per diluted share from our previous outlook of $13.85 to $14.45 per diluted share. Let's move right to our first quarter results. Our first quarter adjusted earnings of $3.31 per diluted share were up 14% year-over-year driven by strong performance in the U.S. pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions business, Medical-Surgical Solutions and our MRxTS businesses. A lower share count higher contribution from our equity investment in Change Healthcare, a one-time gain from investment activities and expense timing. These items were partially offset by the anticipated year-over-year increase in opioid litigation and technology costs which we outlined with our initial outlook in May. Also had a lower profit contribution from the Europe segment and a higher adjusted tax rate. Let me start with the details of our consolidated results, which can be found on slide four. Consolidated revenues for the quarter increased 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment. Adjusted gross profit increased 2% year-over-year, mainly driven by a few key operational items. Within our Medical-Surgical business, the contribution from the MSD acquisition, which we have now lapped, and above market growth in pharmaceutical products, volume growth across our MRxTS offerings, and growth in our specialty provider solutions business within the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, these items were partially offset by foreign currency effects and lower retail pharmacy margins in the U.K. First quarter adjusted operating expenses increased 1% year-over-year partially driven by the acquisition of MSD in the prior year. Adjusted income from operations was $933 million for the quarter, 9% above the prior year. Interest expense was $56 million for the quarter, a decrease of 8% compared to the prior year primarily due to lower commercial paper balances. Our adjusted tax rate was 22.6% for the quarter, mainly driven by our mix of business. We continue to assume a full-year adjusted tax rate of approximately 18% to 19%, which may vary from quarter to quarter and includes anticipated discrete tax items that we expect to realize during the course of the year. Income attributable to non-controlling interests was $54 million for the quarter, a decrease of 7% compared to the prior year and in line with our expectations. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations totaled $625 million and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding were $189 million for the quarter, a decrease of 7% year-over-year. Next, I'll discuss our segment results, which can be found on slides five through eight, and let's start -- I'd like to start with U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions. First quarter revenues were $44.2 billion, up 8% year-over-year driven by solid contributions from our largest retail national pharmacy customer's, growth across our specialty businesses and continued solid performance within our health systems segment partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter increased 11% to $600 million primarily due to strong growth in our specialty businesses continued strong performance by our sourcing operations and the lapping of prior year opioid-related expenses. As a reminder, the State of New York adopted the Opioid Stewardship Act in the first quarter of McKesson's fiscal 2019. Although the Act was being challenged in court, we recorded an accrual in both our GAAP and adjusted results of $15 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment which accounted for the estimated portion of the annual assessment. This legislation was later ruled unconstitutional and the approval was reversed in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 136 basis points, an increase of four basis points. Next European Pharmaceutical Solutions, first quarter revenues were down 3% year-over-year to $6.7 billion. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues were up 3% driven by our market growth in the distribution wholesale business. Segment adjusted operating profit was down 50% to $37 million on an FX adjusted basis mainly due to the weak retail pharmacy environment in the U.K. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 50 basis points on an FX adjusted basis, a decrease of 55 basis points. Our first quarter results were lower than expectations resulting from weak retail pharmacy margins in the U.K. due to industry-wide underfunding by the NHS. We anticipate this underfunding will modestly improve in the second-half of fiscal 2020. As Brian discussed earlier in fiscal 2019, we took actions in the U.K. and across Europe to reposition the business for long-term profitability. These actions included further store rationalization and cost actions. We continue to execute against these restructuring actions as we further evaluate our cost position. As a result of the U.K. outlook, we now expect European segment adjusted operating profit growth to be on the low end of our original assumption of low to mid single digit percent growth. Moving now to Medical Surgical Solutions, first quarter revenues were $1.9 billion, 12% year-over-year. Excluding the MSD acquisition which closed on June 1 of 2018, segment revenue increased 4% driven by growth in our primary care and Extended Care business including strength in pharmaceutical products and our home delivery business. Segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter increased 27% to $159 million driven by organic growth in contribution from the MSD acquisition. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 836 basis points an increase of 102 basis points due to market growth and cost management. Finishing our business review with other, revenues were $3 billion for the quarter down 1% year-over-year. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues grew 2% primarily by growth in our MRxTS business. Other adjusted operating profit increased 31% to $279 million on an FX adjusted basis mainly driven by increased equity income from our investment in Change Healthcare and continued strength in our MRxTS business. Included in other, adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $108 million for the quarter as compared to $64 million in the prior period. Let me take a minute and update you on our equity investments in Change Healthcare. On June 27 of 2019, Change Healthcare began trading on the NASDAQ. This was an important milestone for Change Healthcare, well Change Healthcare is now a publicly traded company McKesson will continue to report the equity income from our interests in Change Healthcare based on our equity ownership percentage and we will continue to report Change Healthcare results on a one-month lag. As a result of the IPO, McKesson's equity ownership in Change Healthcare is approximately 58.5% effective beginning with McKesson's second quarter. When taking into account McKesson's new equity ownership percentage as well as Change Healthcare's repayment of long-term debt following the completion of its IPO, we anticipate the adjusted equity income attributable to our interest in Change Healthcare in fiscal 2020 to be unchanged from the prior range of $250 million to $270 million which it assumes 70% ownership throughout fiscal 2020. I would point out that our adjusted equity interest assumption for Change Healthcare as well as our future results and commentary on Change Healthcare will be specific to McKesson's ownership interest based on McKesson definition of adjusted earnings, our equity ownership percentage in Change Healthcare and the period from which we are reporting which again will be on a one-month lag. Any questions related to the operating performance or the outlook for Change Healthcare will be addressed by the change management team. The IPO was an important next step in McKesson's efforts to unlock value for our shareholders as we progress towards exiting our investment and Change Healthcare in a tax efficient manner. As we've detailed in the past, there are lockup periods in other milestones, which must be met prior to our exit, which include first the customary six month lockup period following the IPO, then Blackstone or equity partner and Change Healthcare has the opportunity to do a secondary offering, covering up to a three month period, falling that there would be a three month lockup period. Given all of these factors, our exit could extend to a period of 12 to 18 months. However, depending on the necessity of certain milestones, we may have the opportunity to exit by the end of our fiscal 2020. We will provide updates as we progress through the respective lockup periods then milestones, as we move closer to our eventual exit. Moving out of corporate expenses, McKesson recorded a $137 million in adjusted corporate expenses in the first quarter, an increase of 44% compared to the prior year. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by the increase in opioid-related litigation costs, and the overall timing of technology investments in the fiscal year, partially offset by a one-time benefit recorded in the first quarter of approximately $0.10. As it relates to opioid-related litigation costs McKesson recorded $36 million in expenses in the first quarter. We continue to assume opioid-related litigation costs will be approximately $150 million in fiscal 2020. Based on the one-time benefit recorded in the first quarter, we now anticipate corporate expenses to be on the low-end of the original assumption of $725 million to $775 million. Turning now to cash, which can be found on Slide 9, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.9 billion. During the quarter, we had negative free cash flow $162 million. This performance was ahead of our expectations. I would remind you the cash flow will vary from quarter-to-quarter impacted by timing, including the day and a week that marks the close of a quarter. We continue to expect free cash flow of approximately $2.8 billion to $3 billion for fiscal 2020. Investment in growth opportunities remains a key priority for McKesson. During the quarter, we made $111 million of capital expenditures and spent $46 million on acquisitions. We continue to focus on internal investment in areas such as data and analytics and information security. We use cash in the quarter to continue returning value to our shareholders. We repurchase $684 million in common stock, and they have $2.8 billion remaining and our share repurchase authorization. We also pay $75 million in dividends in the quarter. And yesterday, the board approved an increase to our quarterly dividend of $0.02 to $0.41, an increase of 5%, which will be payable to shareholders in October. In closing, we are pleased with a strong start to the year. In the first quarter, we had growth across the majority of our businesses, which more than offset the weakness in the retail pharmacy market in the U.K. Our results for the first quarter, which include an unplanned one-time benefit of $0.10, have given us confidence in our full-year fiscal 20 outlook. As a result, we're increasing our adjusted earnings guidance of $0.15 cents to a range of $14 to $14.60 per diluted share, which represents solid growth of approximately 5% at the midpoint versus fiscal 2019. I would remind you that we do not provide quarterly guidance. However, to better inform your modeling. We continue to expect a percentage of adjusted earnings per diluted share in the first-half of the year as compared to the second-half to be similar to fiscal '19. Overall, we're pleased with the focus. The execution of the performance across the company and we are off to a great start at fiscal 2020 and with that Brian and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Lisa Gill with JP Morgan.
Lisa Gill: Thanks very much, and good afternoon. Congratulations on a nice start to the year. Brian, I know that it just came out, you know, this new safe [ph] importation action plan, but just being in Canada, how realistic is this that the manufacturers are going to allow product to go to Canada, then come back to the U.S., and just given the size of the Canadian market. And what role do you think that McKesson can play as the largest distributor in Canada to make sure that, one, product that meant for Canada stays in Canada? And two, anything that does potentially come to the States is safe?
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Lisa, for the question. We do think McKesson is in a uniquely informed position given our business in Canada and our presence here in the U.S., obviously. There were two tracks discussed in the plan that came out today. I will say I was encouraged by the fact that it was an invitation for industry and industry participants to bring their perspectives and knowledge into the discussion. And we will plan to be actively engaged in that. So our first and foremost responsibility and priority will be the safety and security of the supply chain, both in the U.S. and in Canada. Now, you rightly point out the Canadian market, from a population standpoint is less than a 10th of the U.S., and I suppose that various manufacturers will adopt various perspectives on what they may or may not do. We will carefully evaluate with various industry partners what the opportunity may be. But the overarching goal will be safety and security for citizens both north and south of a Canadian-U.S. border.
Lisa Gill: And then just as a follow-up, clearly what they're trying to solve first here is overall drug pricing. Can you talk about what we saw in the quarter around drug price inflation on the brand inside as well as the generic, clearly quarterly results coming better and better, especially on the drug distribution in the U.S. component of the business? So just wondering some of the key drivers there, as well as what you're seeing on both inflation and deflation in generics and branded?
Britt Vitalone: Thanks for that question, Lisa. I'll start, and Brian can add. As we talked about, in Brian's remarks on the branded side, what we saw from an inflation perspective was right along in line with our expectations. As you know, the first quarter is generally a softer quarter for branded inflation historically. And what we saw this quarter was really in line with our expectations. And as we think about the full-year, we are reaffirming our guidance of mid single-digit inflation on the branded side. On the generic side, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of our sourcing operation, ClarusONE. What we've seen thus far in terms of our sourcing performance is right in line with our expectations. And on the sell side, as Brian mentioned, we continue to see a competitive market, but we continue to see a stable market. And so we're pleased with our ability to continue to source very competitively, which is certainly benefiting our customers, and we're certainly pleased with the ability to bring that to the sell side and our customers.
Lisa Gill: Great. Thanks for the comments.
Operator: And next will be Michael Cherny with Bank of America.
Michael Cherny: Good evening. Thanks for all the comments so far. Britt, I want to dive in a little bit more into the U.S. pharma performance, maybe a microcosm for the rest of the business. It seems like just given the sheer magnitude of the performance and the outperformance on revenue, relative to at least your guidance, that a lot of it had to be driven by pharma. That being said, we didn't see a ton of gross margin pull-through. Now I might be splitting hairs a little bit here, but can you just talk a little bit about the dynamics in terms of what was the rationale for the slower gross profit growth relative to the revenue growth?
Britt Vitalone: Sure. Thanks for the question. As I mentioned in my comments, some of the revenue growth that we saw came from some of our largest national retail customers. And as you might expect, they don't generate as great a contribution to gross profit. We did see broad-based strong performance across the segment, not only with our largest national retail customers, but we saw good performance in our Health Systems segment, and we continue to see very strong performance in our Specialty business, and so we're quite pleased with that. Overall in the segment, while our gross profit was lower on a consolidated basis, within our U.S. Pharma and Specialty Solutions segment we saw very good performance at the adjusted operating profit line. So, we're very pleased with the performance that we saw, very broad-based performance across that segment. And we think that we're well positioned to continue and achieve our guidance for the rest of the year.
Michael Cherny: And just on the contribution from Change. The way to think about the fact that the numbers didn't change despite the fact that you had a lower ownership stake versus guidance simply driven by the outperformance contribution for 1Q, or is there anything else that changed in terms of just the methodology, aside from just the pure less ownership stake?
Britt Vitalone: I would say that it's a combination of the lower ownership stake being offset by the deleveraging that changed it as a result of raising the funds for the IPO.
Michael Cherny: Okay, great. Thanks so much.
Operator: And next will be Kevin Caliendo with UBS.
Kevin Caliendo: Great. Thanks for taking my call. A question around the guidance, you beat by by $0.30. You only guide it up by $0.15. I know you mentioned the EU business is now expected to be at the lower end of the range. You also mentioned corporate expenses are going to be lower. Is there any other deltas there, is this conservatism. How should we think about the guidance relative to the beat in the quarter?
Britt Vitalone: Sure. So, I think there's a couple of things there, Kevin. First of all, we had good performance. We also called out a one-time gain from investment activities that is within our corporate expenses, that was about $0.10. So, while we had strong performance across really a broad base of our businesses, we did see weaker performance in our European business, and we did lower the range for the full-year as a result of that. We had the one-time unplanned benefit. We had some favorable timing in our corporate expense line. Again -- and we called out at the beginning of the year, we intend to continue making investments in our business both on a data and analytic side and in a technology side. So, we had strong broad-based performance across the business. We had a one-time gain within our corporate expense line. And I think it's early in the year, but we feel very confident, and confident enough to raise by $0.15.
Kevin Caliendo: Okay. And just a quick follow-up on the Medical segment, you give us the revenues ex MSD they would have been up 4%. What would the EBIT growth have been ex MSD in medical as we're not lapping it, just to give us a little bit of a better view of sort of what that business might look like going forward?
Britt Vitalone: Yes, we don't break that down specifically, Kevin, but what I would tell you is we had strong organic performance within that business. And as I mentioned, we had strong pharmaceutical sales performance as well as continued strong performance in our home delivery business. So we're pleased with the overall performance of the segment. We're pleased with the execution against the MSD acquisition. And as I mentioned, across the broad base of that business we had growth in pharmaceuticals, we had growth in our primary care business, as well as our home delivery business, so good organic growth as well as the MSD contribution.
Kevin Caliendo: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Next will be Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser: Yes, hi, good evening. So the first question here on the guidance. Obviously you had a very good performance on the top line. But when we look at your U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions guidance for the remainder of the year, it would suggest that revenues are going to normalize, where we're getting to around plus 4% to negative 1% on the revenue. And on the operating profit as well, kind of like a negative 2% to about 3.3% growth. So was there any kind of like pull forward of revenues this quarter that's going to normalize for the remainder of the year, or what kind of like drove that strength? I understand it is your largest customers, but if you can give us some more color behind that?
Britt Vitalone: Sure, thanks, Ricky. There's nothing unusual about the revenue development in the quarter, there's nothing that I would call out as a pull forward, to use your terminology. And we had very strong performance. It was primarily in our largest retail national accounts. But again, as I mentioned, we had a broad base of revenue growth across the business. One thing I would point out about our adjusted operating profit for the quarter, as I talked about in my opening remarks, last year we did have the opioid litigation cost that were included in that segment's results. And as I mentioned, we recorded $15 million last year for the New York State assessment. So I think you should factor that in. We're very pleased with the performance. We continue to expect to see growth in this segment for the remainder of the year. And we're very pleased with the revenue development.
Ricky Goldwasser: Okay. So let me ask a follow-up on specialty and think this is kind of like the third quarter both you and your peers are highlighting the strength in specialty is benefiting results. So can you just share with us little bit more color on specialty and whether you've seen any contractual changes in the last year that would explain the improvement in benefit because I'm assuming it's not coming from branded inflation. So how should we think about it benefit and how should we think about the sustainability of that benefit. And I think that historically you talked about specialty margin is being below traditional branded drugs. Is that still the case or should we assume that margins have re-rated higher?
Brian Tyler: I'll take this one and Britt can jump in if he'd like. So when you think about the Specialty as a segment and obviously the pipeline of innovation continues to be heavily slanted towards these types of products. In full legacy core U.S. pharma business, the margin profiles and structures you'd be accustomed to, I would characterize as still being in place and so while we do benefit from that specialty growth through good volumes and it is beneficial for us on the gross profit line, it does continue to be modestly dilutive to the rate. I would remind you though we also have a very good business in the community setting related to specialty products and that's both our U.S. oncology network and our unaffiliated community provider business. And those are the businesses where we continue to see really good momentum, really good growth and benefit from the pipeline of both innovative products and frankly biosimilars as they emerge and come to market. And we have a very robust value proposition obviously a complete value proposition in the case of U.S. oncology. And then a wide assortment of tools and services we offer to the unaffiliated community providers and we think that that value proposition continues to earn us the right and the ability to grow and to benefit from the Specialty Pharmaceutical pipeline in general.
Operator: And next will be Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.
Ross Muken: Good afternoon, guys. So I just wanted to go back to kind of the change in other math again because I don't think I have it straight. So in terms of the $108 million versus the prior year and then and that's for Change and then sort of the full-year guide I'm not sure I understand sort of what caused the up step and cadence and then sort of the notable downside. I know the ownership percentage is changing but it still seemed like a big delta and I'm guessing that's essentially what caused the spike in the other segment profits. I'm just trying to figure out sort of why that cadence was kind of funkier than what I think one would have expected?
Brian Tyler: Sure. Thanks for the question, Ross. So let me start with just the other side of the other segment just generally. With that segment we have our Canadian business we have our MRxTS businesses which are very strong businesses and growing very well for us. And we have our Change, our equity investment in Change. First I'd point out that our Canadian business continues to perform well, we certainly talked about the impact from the generic legislation at the beginning of the year. And that team really did a great job in mitigating that. And we're pleased with the performance of Canada, our MRxTS businesses continue to grow very well and we're making invest -- continue to make investments in those businesses. Within our Change asset, we did have the ownership Change from 70% to 58.5% effective in our second quarter. And in that second quarter, you'll also see the impact from the delevering. Within the first quarter though, there are a couple of things that I would point out. First of all Change had as most companies had the implementation of the revenue recognition standard and that created a timing element for the year. For the full-year that's not going to have an impact on McKesson but it does have an impact earlier, favorable impact earlier than year and then a reverse out as the year goes on. And then of course as you think about that business, there's a mix of income between taxable, non-taxable depending on the legal entity. So what I would say is primarily for the first quarter, you see some timing impact from the revenue recognition standard and you see a mix of income between the entities of taxable and non-taxable.
Ross Muken: Got it. And then maybe just thinking about sort of, maybe business development activity or the M&A side of things, a lot of things and services, including your own asset, obviously have challenging multiples. And there's a lot of political wins going on, I guess, how do you sort of frame what's the right time to be more active again, on sort of tuck-in M&A and how the risk reward sort of, is there versus just continuing to buy your own equity, which given is cash flow yield seems like a reasonable investment.
Brian Tyler: Yes, thanks. Thanks for the question. And I think we would characterize our M&A activity in recent quarters of being relatively light, that doesn't mean that we're out of that space. And then, I think when we think about capital allocation, and we're always very focused on where are the opportunities to deploy capital to build platforms and businesses and services for sustainable growth over the long-term. We are being very diligent to make sure that as we look at this process that is guided by our strategy, that's guided by our focal areas, it's guided by the markets and segments where we think we have good businesses, strong teams, the right to win. And anywhere in those segments, we can find assets that are complimentary and accelerate and an accelerant to our business. We're quite interested in those. We obviously consider alternative use of the capital and return of the capital in making those calculations and final determinations of what's the best way to deploy that capital on behalf of our shareholders. So we continue to be active, we continue to be in deal flow. We continue to look carefully at the landscape with an eye to make sure it's aligned strategically that it's an investment and accelerant. And that it is the smartest way to deploy capital across the various uses of capital we have.
Ross Muken: Thanks, guys.
Operator: And moving on to Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research.
Stephen Baxter: Hi, thanks for the question. I wanted to ask about the sell side environment. You said in the past that in general your contracts last about three years. So it appears to be coming up against some of the independent pharmacy contracts that renewed during 2016. Can you give us, and hopefully give us a sense of what proportion of those contracts have been addressed at this point? And also any color you can write on with the discussions look like in terms of helping your pharmacy partners deal with the pressure they are under would be very helpful, thanks.
Britt Vitalone: Yes, so typically, as we've talked about, we would renew roughly a third of our contracts in any one given year. We recently got through two big retail national account renewals successfully, which was great news and I'd say, I'd characterize this year is having a fairly normal portfolio of renewals and renewal activities. So I wouldn't point to anything particularly unusual in that regard. You know, we work with our partners over the life of these contracts. We are typically engaging in, day-to-day and discussions; we begin conversations well in advance of any sort of sudden renewal activity. So we really view it as kind of an ongoing dialogue and an ongoing partnership over the course of these contracts. And you'll be well familiar with our track record of renewing these particularly larger deals as it relates to independence in general and what are we doing to help independence? I would say independence is probably long been at the core of McKesson as a company. It's a key part of our commitment that community practices we think being central to addressing the access cost and quality issues this country faces the independence -- continue to benefit from the programs and services that we invest in. They can hence, they can choose to consume that and a sort of all-encompassing way through a relationship with Health Mart and our access reimbursement services that come along with that. But we are constantly looking at how we innovate for them both and how they interact with their patients, how they attract patients and draw footfall to their stores, how they monetize that footfall, both in front and behind the counter, and we work with them, day-in and day-out and then just the efficiency of the operation of their business. Community pharmacy today feels reimbursement pressure, it's felt that pressure every year, I've been in the business and that's almost 23 years now. So we partner with them very closely to help them ensure their position to survive and adapt and innovate and independent community pharmacies do tend to be creative individual business folks who find ways to unmet needs in the communities they serve.
Stephen Baxter: Okay, thanks. I appreciate the color. And then just one quickly on capital deployment and the pacing of share repurchase, so it looks like if you carry this magnitude of share repurchase through the balance of the year, you'd end up with something a few million shares below where your guidance is which looks like 185 million shares unchanged versus previous, so I was wondering if you could help us understand the progression of share repurchase and how you guys approach the balance between opportunism and planned activity throughout the year. Thanks.
Brian Tyler: Yes, thanks for the question. I would just reaffirm that we've not changed our assumption on our diluted shares for the end of the year. We don't have a set amount that you should think about for modeling to take it from quarter-to-quarter. We think about capital deployment and as Brian mentioned, we think about it opportunities on strategy and where we have opportunities to invest on strategy or invest internally, we do that. And certainly, we've had an opportunity this quarter to return more to our shareholders. So we make those decisions on a regular basis, but in terms of our guide on shares for the end of the year, we've not changed that.
Operator: And our next question will come from Eric Percher with Nippon Research.
Eric Percher: Thank you. I'd like to go back to the gross margin question and maybe given the comments around independents I know that was one segment that hasn't been driving the same contribution that some of the other areas, the retail nationals and other less profitable accounts maybe as you think about the growth in revenue and what that translates into had a press profit growth level at a period of time where independents aren't driving it and a period of time where generic contributions aren't as high what do you see as the and natural growth rate?
Brian Tyler: Well, Eric, what I would point to is if you look at our consolidated gross margin, there is multiple factors to consider in here and one of the things that impacted our gross margin in the quarter was the weak retail results in our U.K. business within Europe. And clearly, we had a large proportion of revenue being driven by our largest retail national account. We have, we had a very broad base of revenue growth across our business and overall I would just say that one of the things that impacted to the negative side was not only the mix of revenue, but the impact from a weak retail environment in the U.K. We think about our independent customers within U.S. Pharma. We haven't seen anything different this quarter from the previous couple of quarters. It was -- I don't know that there's anything really to call out specific about that.
Britt Vitalone: Yes, when we look at the kind of reimbursement environment that retail independents are facing, I think we talked last quarter about the fact that we look at our data, we really see an aggregate a very normal headwind there has been established something that's kind of been consistent with prior years. And on average, that is true statement within that average there are based on patient mix and contracts that the government private commercial product mix and the really the patient population in your in catchment area, you can see some winners and some losers. But on a blended way is really feels like a steady the same steady reimbursement headwind we've been accustomed to.
Eric Percher: So I think we see that and certainly the headwind in international gross margin is evident, but my question is really where we don't see at a distribution and specialty segment level, what are your thoughts on the ability to drive gross profit growth relative to revenue growth and that's really the question was getting at?
Brian Tyler: Well, as we've talked about previously, Eric the growth of specialty products is going to have a dilutive impact on the rate. It's certainly very good for us from a margin dollars perspective as I think about that the U.S. Pharma and Specialty Solutions business, again, it's a business that is broad-based from a distribution perspective, both in the nature of the products in the customers, but also the specialty businesses that Brian talked about our U.S. oncology asset, our provider base that we have and also the manufacturing life capabilities that the services that we provide to the manufacture those also add to our gross margin profile. So, and I think about our distribution business is very scale certainly is impacted by the product mix, but the fact that it's broad-based in terms of our U.S. Oncology asset or other specialty assets and then our manufacturing services assets, I think that really does give us the opportunity to develop that gross profit over time.
Eric Percher: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning guys. Congratulations. Britt just want to follow-up on Ricky's question from earlier clarify that question again. So you put up an 8% growth number in the U.S. for Q1 and yet you're maintaining the guidance calling low to mid single digits. So is there anything we should be thinking about that could drive a deceleration in growth. I mean you've talked about specialty being strong or is there anything to call out there?
Britt Vitalone: Yes, I would the thing that I would point out is I think we saw a larger proportion of revenue from our largest retail national accounts in the quarter. We still expect to see very strong revenue growth in the mid single digit range for the year. I think as you just think about the quarterization of that, we saw it a larger proportion of that coming from our largest accounts and that had obviously a very favorable impact in the quarter.
Brian Tanquilut: Got it. All right, thanks guys.
Britt Vitalone: Thanks, Brian.
Operator: Our next question will come from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Jones: Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess similar one Britt on the corporate expense side. You're pointing towards the lower end but just looking at where you ended up in the quarter, it still seems like quite a big ramp through the year to get there. Anything you know of or that you anticipate on the corporate expense side that it would be terribly different than what we saw in the quarter. And then I guess Brian just I'll throw my follow-up out there. I'm sorry if I missed this in the prepared remarks but large proposed generic merger out there. Curious if or how impactful that would be on not only ClarusONE but on McKesson in general if you had a view that would be great. Thanks.
Britt Vitalone: Thanks for the question. I'll start and then I'll turn it over to Brian as we think of our corporate expenses at the beginning of the year, we talked about the things that are driving the higher corporate expense year-over-year. We talked about the increase in opioid litigation costs. We talked about the increased investments that we were making in technology particularly infrastructure and data and analytics. We still intend to make those investments throughout the year. We had a favorable timing related impact in the first quarter but our intention is to continue to invest in those capabilities as we go throughout the rest of the year. We also in my remarks, I talked about our opioid litigation cost projection for the full-year still remaining at $150 million. And then the thing that I did talk about that is included on our corporate expenses was the onetime benefit we had from investing activities which reduced our corporate expenses in the quarter and that allowed us to take our guide corporate expenses down to the low end of the range that we provided at the beginning of the year.
Brian Tyler: Robert to your second question, we actually did not comment on this, I think in our opening remarks. So thank you for the question on the Pfizer-Mylan merger. So I would start by saying that these we have strong relationships with both of these organizations and they've been important partners for us. And if McKesson and in ClarusONE the rationale for the merger as I understand it is broadening of the portfolio, there is some cost synergy, some efficiency and frankly at the scale that we operate and by being partners with large scale healthy organizations that are capable of continuity of supply and competitive pricing is it can be a good thing. So we'll evaluate how this merger comes together. We'll continue to be a dialog with them but it wouldn't say it poses any imminent concerns from our perspective.
Operator: And our next question will come from Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company.
Charles Rhyee: Yes, hey thanks for taking questions. I think you touched on biosimilars being a benefit particularly in the oncology network. Can you talk about sort of your outlook here? I think there's some talks about I think insulin moving over to jurisdiction by the -- I guess with the biologics group and FDA, CIBR and that that could pave the way for interchangeability on at least with biosimilars insulin. Maybe your thoughts on where you're seeing sort of that regulatory landscape right now and how you think about that opportunity and what it means further down the road for you?
Brian Tyler: Well, I mean the biosimilar landscape in general, we feel pretty positive about more choices more substitute ability or interchangeability that gives clinician, the more choices hopefully gives it helps addressed cost challenges we see in the marketplace and we think with the footprint of providers that we have in the community, we're particularly well positioned to take advantage of those trends. So, we also continue to work with innovators, first and foremost, as we think about these if the patient outcome is a clinical-oriented decision is what product is best in the formulary to meet the clinical needs to the extent, there are a variety of choices and interchangeability that tends to be good for a company like us with the markets and channels that we serve that choice tends to be a positive thing for us.
Charles Rhyee: Is that something that you think is coming close in that you're trying to plan ahead of that or is that you feel there is still a ways off?
Brian Tyler: It's really hard to comment on what the regulatory pathways will be and timing and our recent experience in policy arena tells us anything, it's very difficult to forecast. What may come out, lots of discussion what they come out ultimately and what it may look like in its final form it would be, it would probably not be in my best judgment to try to predict that for you.
Charles Rhyee: Okay, fair enough. And just one last question, you talked about the FX impact being sort of net neutral but if I look, it seems like, particularly the pound and the euro have been getting weaker relative to the dollar, how are you guys thinking about that or sort of what your expectations around that. Thanks.
Britt Vitalone: Yes, I don't want to predict the direction of the pound. On a consolidated basis, it doesn't have a material impact. But as I called out, it did have an impact on revenues within the Europe segment for the quarter. So, obviously we'll watch that very carefully but as we think about it on a consolidated basis, we don't see an impact.
Charles Rhyee: Great, thank you.
Holly Weiss: Operator, you have time for one more question.
Operator: Certainly that question will come from Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird.
Eric Coldwell: Hi, thanks very much and good evening. Most of my main ones recovered but I'll shift gears a bit, I would like your thoughts on generic introductions for the rest of the year if possible, expected to be a good guy or a bad guy to profitability on a year-over-year basis and then specifically if I dare ask Lyrica comes out with roughly 10 manufacturer is a very low initial price. How did that impact pretty big product, how does that impact your thinking on generic profitability in trends in that market seen so many manufacturers launch it such a deep discount to the brand.
Brian Tyler: Yes, thanks for that question. Generic launches as we've talked about do not have the size of impact that they used to have -- they have a modest impact on our profitability. So we don't see that having any change from our previous views on that. In terms of Lyrica, we are very fortunate to have a strong sourcing organization like first one where we can partner with multiple manufacturers. We don't see that Lyrica is going to change the direction of our generics profitability will certainly be a benefit for us and it will certainly be a benefit from our customers, but it will have a modest impact at most.
Eric Coldwell: Great.
Brian Tyler: Well, thank you everyone for your questions, and thank you, Justin for facilitating this call. I want to thank everyone on the call today for your time. McKesson is off to a strong start for our fiscal 2020 and I'm really excited about the opportunities ahead of us. I do want to take a minute to recognize the outstanding performance of really all of the McKesson employees and team members and their contributions to help our customers improve lives and deliver opportunities, make better health possible. So thank you team McKesson. Have a good evening everyone.
Operator: Well, thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.

===== 2019 Q4  (2019-05-08 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the McKesson Q4 Earnings Call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Holly Weiss. Please go ahead, ma’am.
Holly Weiss: Thank you, Ebony. Good morning and welcome everyone to McKesson’s Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Call. Today, I’m joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. Today’s discussion will include forward-looking statements, such as forecast about McKesson’s operations and future results. Please refer to the cautionary statements in today’s press release and our slide presentation, and to the risk factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward-looking statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Additional information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results is included in today’s press release and presentation slides, and is also available on our website at investor.mckesson.com. With that, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Holly, and thanks everyone for joining us on our call. Today, we’re going to focus on our fiscal 2019 results and our outlook for fiscal 2020. Britt will cover our financial performance in greater detail, but first let me take a couple of minutes to discuss some of our important accomplishments and why we’re so confident in McKesson’s future. During our fiscal 2019, we saw increasing momentum in our strategic growth initiative, including priority areas that focused on manufacturer value proposition, specialty pharmaceuticals or biopharma services, and the expanding role of retail pharmacy in community health services, all this supported by our ongoing investments in data and analytics. We also continued to optimize our operating model to improve our cost position, and the overall speed and effectiveness of the organization. We recently renewed our CVS agreement. This follows renewal of our Rite Aid agreement and a two-year extension of our Veterans Affairs agreement earlier in the year. We believe our strong value proposition and superior service quality were critical to allow us to continue supporting the success of these customers, and we are very pleased to continue these longstanding partnerships. We made several changes to strengthen our leadership team including the promotion of Kirk Kaminsky as President of our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment; the promotion of Kevin Kettler as the President of our Europe segment; and the hiring of a new leader for our UK business.  More recently, we appointed Tracy Faber as our Chief Human Resource Officer to succeed Jorge Figueredo upon his retirement later this year. In our medical business, we acquired Medical Specialties Distributors or MSD, which has among other things, expanded our value proposition with manufacturers and brought specialty infusion capabilities and services. It is progressing in line with its business case. And Change Healthcare filed its S-1 with an intention to complete an IPO, market conditions permitting. In terms of overall performance for the quarter, I’m pleased with our adjusted EPS of $3.69, up 6% versus the prior year driven by solid execution across multiple businesses. And for the year, we were able to deliver results that were in line with our expectations outlined at the beginning of the year. Our fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings of $13.57 represents 8% year-over-year growth. Despite the challenging industry environment we faced in fiscal 2019, as a company, I’m pleased with our results. We have scaled businesses in many good markets and we are a critical resource to providers in the community care setting. Through our 80,000 associates acting together, we successfully delivered for our customers, executed and took decisive action to position McKesson for success over the long haul. Looking forward now to fiscal 2020. Our fiscal 2020 outlook for adjusted earnings of $13.85 to $14.45 per diluted share represents low to mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year growth. This outlook reflects solid growth across our operating segments, a continuation of disciplined efficient capital deployment, investments in the business, increased cost for opioid litigation and modestly improved UK results. I will remind you that this guidance is inclusive of our organic growth and our organic – and our strategic growth initiatives. Britt will cover this in more detail. I’ll now touch on developments in each of our businesses during the past year, which provide a platform to deliver [indiscernible] organic growth. In our European Pharmaceutical segment, we experienced sizable UK government reimbursement cuts, which we have previously discussed, and we took additional actions this quarter to further rationalize our footprint and back office operations in Europe. Overall, for Europe, we anticipate revenue to be growing by low-to-mid single digits, driven by market growth with no incremental UK cuts contemplated in our fiscal 2020 guide. In Medical-Surgical, we delivered another year of solid growth across all of our customer channels and we are well positioned to support the growing alternate site markets. The acquisition of MSD and our investments in home delivery help us meet the needs of the patient wherever it suits them and further supports our growth in this segment. For the medical segment, we expect to deliver revenue growth in the high-single-digit range for fiscal 2020. Now, turning to other, which primarily comprises McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions, or MRxTS, Canada and our investment in Change Healthcare. MRxTS is a fundamental part of our strategy to improve healthcare one patient, one prescription, one partner at a time. We are excited by innovative solutions like RxBenefit Clarity, which provides transparency around prescription pricing at the point of prescribing for any medication and all payors. Physicians and patients are excited about this tool and a fast-growing number of them, currently over 100,000, benefit from information they can really use to make timely decisions. We believe we can do much more to improve transparency for patients and to improve adherence by enhancing the ability of patients, pharmacists to collaborate with their prescribing physicians. In Canada, we made significant progress to mitigate the impact of government actions as we move through fiscal 2019. Our Canadian retail presence combined with Well.ca, which, by the way, was recognized by Forrester as the Number one digital retailer in Canada in 2018 provides patients with another channel to connect with us and we’ve been piloting our future retail pharmacy concept that evolves the patient experience, which is currently being expanded to more sites. We also announced a collaboration with Google Cloud that will able us to accelerate how we leverage our data to develop insights and predictive capabilities that will support better patient outcomes and reduce waste. In combination, we expect other to deliver a flat to low-single-digit revenue decline for fiscal 2020. We remain confident in McKesson’s path forward, the critical role of the services we provide to the healthcare industry today and our ability to identify and apply solutions to address the most pressing challenges to healthcare systems globally. In particular, we have a scaled presence across important community care settings, including community pharmacies, specialty providers, oncology, alternate sites, which are all critical to addressing the nation’s cost, quality and access challenges. Before I wrap up, I want to take a moment to share our perspective on the evolving drug pricing reform landscape and opioid litigation. Given our broad capabilities and the multitude of customers and channels that we serve are sometimes referred to 360-degree view of the supply chain. We’ve been actively engaged with the administration, Congress and industry stakeholders to provide thought leadership on a range of proposed policy changes. The breadth and depth of our enterprise-wide assets provides a platform for developing new solutions that can help the industry adapt. Our MRxTS or our Pharmacy Technology business has been investing in real time benefits tools and cost transparency solutions for patients, prescribers and pharmacies, so they can make informed choices about the cost of therapy. As we move towards the world potentially without rebates, our manufacturer partners and pharmacy customers are interested in exploring new and innovative operating models. We’re committed to being part of that solution. We have differentiated technology capabilities that can help move a solution forward, leveraging our retail health, pharmacy switch, and assets and capabilities like our chargeback platform in our wholesale business. Our unique experience in value-based programs such as the Oncology Care Model optimally position us to support the evolving needs of providers as they adapt to new care delivery models and value-based payment programs. With respect to opioid litigation, you are all well aware of the scope and complexity of litigations facing McKesson and many members of the pharmaceutical supply chain. Last week, we announced a settlement with the State of West Virginia. The settlement resolves all the state’s past claims regarding McKesson’s operations in West Virginia. While we deny wrongdoing, it’s important to us that this settlement provides funding towards initiative intended to address the opioid epidemic itself. We remain committed to resolving other claims and more importantly to being part of the solution to this public health crisis. For example, we have contributed $100 million to a foundation focused on combating the crisis. We’ve been educating our customers to comply with regulations and identify warning signs of prescription abuse and potential diversion. We’ve advocated for solutions identified in our white paper, call to action; execute solutions today to combat the opioid epidemic. These solutions in our white paper include the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, which was signed into law last year and the ALERT Act, which, if passed, would establish a prescription safety alert system to help identify patients at risk for opioid abuse. Finally, I’d like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their continuing dedication, leadership and consistent focus on a safe and secure supply chain as we strive to improve care in every setting, one product, one partner, one patient at a time. I’m continually inspired by letters I receive from patients who’d tell us about our associates consistently going the extra mile to ensure great health outcomes. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Britt.
Britt Vitalone: Thanks, Brian, and good morning. Today I’ll provide an update on our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2019 results, and then I’ll close by providing our fiscal 2020 guidance before turning to your questions. My comments will focus primarily on our adjusted earnings results. However, I want to start by discussing two items that impacted our GAAP-only results. As a result of the dynamic market environment, regulatory headwinds and business performance in our European segment, we recorded an after-tax charge of $1.5 billion in our fiscal fourth quarter, reflecting non-cash goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges, and restructuring charges that are largely in our European business. The impairment charges were mainly due to declines in estimated future cash flows, primarily attributable to the effects of UK government reimbursement reductions and competitive pressures in the UK. Following this charge, there is no remaining goodwill balance in our European business. The restructuring charges in our European business are related to actions taken to address our performance in the segment. We’re working to reinforce and accelerate our UK restructuring through further closures of retail pharmacy stores and cost management efforts throughout Europe. We anticipate recording additional restructuring charges in future periods as we execute on planned actions. We remain focused on our business performance in the UK and Europe more broadly, and we’ve taken these actions to better position the business for the future. Now, let’s discuss our fiscal 2019 results. As a reminder, our initial fiscal year 2019 guidance called for adjusted earnings per diluted share of $13.00 to $13.80. Despite significant regulatory and competitive headwinds, fiscal 2019 adjusted EPS was $13.57, 8% above fiscal 2018 and above the midpoint of our initial guidance. And fourth quarter adjusted earnings of $3.69 per diluted share were ahead of our expectations. We exit the year with another quarter of solid performance and remain focused on building upon this positive momentum as we enter fiscal 2020. Starting with the details of our full year fiscal 2019 consolidated results, which can be found on Slide 5. Consolidated revenues for the year increased 3% versus fiscal 2018, primarily driven by market growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, acquisitions, and organic growth in our Medical-Surgical segment, partially offset by Q4 fiscal 2018 customer losses, which we’ve discussed previously. Adjusted gross profit was up 2% year-over-year, mainly driven by growth in U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions, or MRxTS, Medical-Surgical and contributions from acquisitions. These positive developments were partially offset by Q4 fiscal 2018 customer losses, headwinds in our European segment and the fiscal 2018 sale of the Enterprise Information Solutions business. Fiscal 2019 adjusted operating expenses increased 4% year-over-year, principally driven by acquisitions, increased opioid-related litigation costs, investments to support growth, including incremental spend on data and analytics capabilities and information security, and charges related to the Q3 fiscal 2019 bankruptcy of Shopko within our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment. These increases were partially offset by the lapping of the $100 million contribution to create a non-profit foundation for opioids in Q4 fiscal 2018, the $90 million reversal during Q2 fiscal 2019 of a contractual liability associated with our equity investment in Change Healthcare and the fiscal 2018 sale of the Enterprise Information Solutions business. Adjusted income from operations was $3.8 billion for the year, a decrease of 2% from the prior year. Interest expense was $264 million for the year, a decrease of 7% compared to the prior year, reflecting fiscal 2018 fourth quarter refinancing of debt at lower interest rates. Adjusted tax rate was 17.8% for the year, mainly driven by our mix of business and discrete tax benefits. Income attributable to non-controlling interest was $221 million for the year, a decrease of 4% compared to the prior year. Adjusted net income from continuing operations totaled $2.7 billion and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 197 million for the year, a decrease of 6% year-over-year. Next, I’ll discuss our full year segment results, which can be found on Slide 6 through 9, and let me start with U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions. Revenues were $167.8 billion for the year, up 3% driven by market growth and acquisitions, partially offset by previously disclosed Q4 fiscal 2018 customer losses in branded to generic conversions. Segment adjusted operating profit for the year was down 2% to $2.5 billion due to fiscal 2018 customer losses and the ShopKo bankruptcy, which offset higher growth in our specialty business and acquisitions. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 150 basis points, a decrease of eight basis points. Next, European Pharmaceutical Solutions. Fiscal 2019 revenues were flat to fiscal 2018 at $27.2 billion for the year. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues were up 1% driven by solid performance outside of the UK, mostly offset by the fiscal 2018 reduction of approximately 200 retail pharmacies and challenging market environments in the UK and France. Segment adjusted operating profit was down 36% to $219 million, and on an FX adjusted basis, down 35% to $220 million. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 80 basis points on both the reported and an FX adjusted basis, which was a decrease of 44 basis points. The decline in this segment was driven by headwinds in the UK, which included inventory charge of approximately $20 million. Moving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $7.6 billion for the year, which were up 15% driven by the Medical Specialties Distributors, or MSD, acquisition and growth in our primary care business, most notably from growth in pharmaceutical products and lab solutions. Excluding the MSD acquisition, segment revenue grew 6%. Segment adjusted operating profit for the year increased 11% to $605 million, driven by solid operational performance, contribution from the MSD acquisition, and ongoing cost management, partially offset by additional investments to support business growth. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 794 basis points, a decrease of 29 basis points, driven by growth in lower margin pharmaceutical products and investments in our patient home delivery business. Finishing our business review with other. Revenues were $11.7 billion for the year, down 1%. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues grew 1% driven primarily by market growth across the businesses within this segment, partially offset by the April 2018 government pricing actions in Canada and the sale of our Enterprise Information Solutions business in fiscal 2018. Other adjusted operating profit increased 8% to $1 billion on an FX adjusted basis, driven mainly by growth in our MRxTS business and a $9 million reversal of a contractual liability associated with our equity investment in Change Healthcare in the second quarter. This was partially offset by the fiscal 2018 sale of the Enterprise Information Solutions business and the impact of the April 2018 government pricing actions in Canada. Included in other, adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $242 million for the year. Next, McKesson recorded $555 million in adjusted corporate expenses, an increase of 7% compared to the prior year. There are a few discrete items impacting the expense growth, led by the increase in opioid-related litigation costs and investments in technology infrastructure. These items were partially offset by the fiscal 2018 contribution to create a non-profit foundation for opioid, which is detailed in our press release. Excluding these items, we’re executing on cost discipline, an important component to driving leverage, and a key part of our financial model that we have confidence in driving and sustaining over the long term. Turning now to cash, which can be found on Slide 10. Our cash flow remains dependably strong as we remain focused on working capital efficiency and cash flow generation. For the fiscal year, we generated $3.5 billion in free cash flow, which includes $557 million spent on capital expenditures. With the scale of our distribution businesses, there can be variability in our cash flows from quarter-to-quarter, including the day of the week a quarter ends on. A portion of the fiscal 2019 performance was due to favorable timing in our U.S. distribution and European businesses. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3 billion. And in fiscal 2019, we returned $1.9 billion to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. Additionally, we have a total of $3.5 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Before turning to our outlook for fiscal 2020, I’d like to make a few comments as it relates to the fourth quarter. Our detailed results are provided in our press release, so I’ll just hit a few of the highlights. Consolidated revenue grew 3% on an FX adjusted basis. Revenue was led by market growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, and acquisitions, partially offset by the Q4 fiscal 2018 customer losses, which we’ve discussed previously. Adjusted earnings per share were $3.69, up 6% for the quarter. This result exceeded our expectation and was led by a lower share count, strong performance in Medical-Surgical and MRxTS, offset by the weak Europe segment results, principally driven by the inventory charge in the UK and a higher tax rate. Free cash flow for the quarter was $3.7 billion, led by strong working capital performance and some favorable timing. In summary, adjusted operating profit performance was ahead of our expectations in our segments with the exception of Europe. Earnings per share were in line with the most recent guidance range, despite increased opioid litigation costs and investments in technology, and we generated strong free cash flow above our target. Overall, we demonstrated progress in many areas, but importantly, there’s room to improve on all metrics. Now let me turn to our fiscal 2020 outlook. The dynamic macro environment from this past fiscal year, which was led by regulatory impacts, particularly in our international retail markets, uncertainty regarding the outcome of several U.S. drug pricing proposals, reimbursement headwinds, and increased opioid-related litigation costs, will continue to confront us in fiscal 2020. We continue to invest in several strategic initiatives and we’re making solid progress against our cost in operating model programs. We’ve attempted to construct guidance ranges that reflect these components. We expect adjusted earnings per share of $13.85 to $14.45 for fiscal 2020, which contemplates adjusted operating profit growth across each of our segments, including our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, and we will continue to deploy capital in a disciplined manner. Please refer to our press release and Slides 11 to 14 in our supplemental slide presentation for our full list of fiscal 2020 assumptions. In lieu of outlining each assumption, I’ll instead walk you through the key items, and I’ll start with the segment. In the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, we expect low to mid-single-digit percent revenue growth, primarily driven by market growth, including strong performance in our specialty business. Adjusted operating profit is expected to grow in the low to mid-single-digit percent, primarily driven by growth in our specialty business and ongoing cost management. In the US market, we anticipate mid-single-digit percent branded pharmaceutical price increases, consistent with our experience in fiscal 2019. As a reminder, approximately 95% of our contracts with branded manufacturers are on a fixed fee rate for service basis. As Brian noted, we are pleased to have renewed our agreement with CVS Health. Both the CVS Health renewal and the Rite Aid renewal during fiscal 2019 are included in our fiscal 2020 expectations for the segment. Moving to the European Solutions segment, we expect low to mid-single-digit percent revenue growth. Adjusted operating profit is also expected to grow in the low to mid-single-digit percent, driven by solid performance in countries outside of UK and cost management programs, including the benefit from recent restructuring actions. This outlook assumes a modest improvement in our UK business with no incremental reimbursement cuts contemplated. We’re focused on executing against key initiatives to strengthen the business in the UK and bolster the performance in other European countries. Moving to Medical-Surgical Solutions, we expect high-single-digit percent revenue growth, primarily driven by the shift of care to lower cost settings, increased demand in patient home delivery, and growth in pharmaceutical products. We expect high single to low double digit percent adjusted operating profit growth, reflecting organic growth, synergies from the MSD acquisition, benefits from fiscal 2019 investments in the patient home delivery business, and operating expense leverage. For the remaining businesses included in other, revenue is expected to be approximately flat to down by a low-single-digit percent, driven by the exit of an unprofitable customer in our Canadian business, partially offset by anticipated volume expansion and increasing sales in MRxTS. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be down by a low to mid-single-digit percent, driven principally by the $90 million reversal of a contractual liability associated with our equity investment in Change Healthcare in our second quarter of fiscal 2019. For Change Healthcare, we anticipate the adjusted equity income attributable to our interest to be in the range of $250 million to $270 million, which assumes that our ownership continues at 70% throughout fiscal 2020. As a reminder, Change Healthcare Inc., which owns the remaining 30% of Change Healthcare, filed its S-1 with the SEC on March 15, 2019. It continues to make progress towards a potential IPO. We will not comment specifically on the anticipated performance of the business, I’d instead refer you to SEC filings by Change Healthcare Inc. for further information. Moving on now to corporate expenses. As detailed in our press release, our fiscal [indiscernible] guidance contemplates increased corporate expenses year-over-year. This assumption reflects an increase in opioid-related litigation costs to approximately $150 million, an increase over fiscal 2019 of approximately $70 million related to technology investments, most notably infrastructure, and data and analytics investments, investments related to our strategic growth initiatives, and a decline in other income. As a result of these items, we anticipate adjusted corporate expenses will be in the range of $725 million to $775 million for fiscal 2020. While we’re not providing an outlook beyond fiscal 2020 today, we anticipate that investments related to technology, our growth investments and initiatives, and operating model optimization efforts will be higher in fiscal 2020 than future fiscal years. Now turning to the consolidated view. We expect low to mid-single-digit percent revenue growth and adjusted income from operations is anticipated to be flat to down by a low-single-digit percent. While we expect adjusted operating profit growth in the majority of our businesses, this growth will be partially offset by the higher corporate expenses that I outlined earlier. We remain particularly focused on lowering operating expenses across the organization, in addition to the important progress we’re making on our operating model optimization. As a result of recent restructuring efforts, we’ve increased our annual pre-tax gross cost savings target from approximately $300 million to $400 million to a new range of $400 million to $500 million.  We expect these savings will be substantially realized by the end of fiscal 2021 and we’ve made solid progress in fiscal 2019, and we’re tracking in line with our expectations. Moving now to below the line. We assume a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 18% to 19%, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter and includes anticipated discrete tax items that we expect to realize during the course of the year. We expect weighted average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2020 to be approximately $185 million, which reflects share repurchases completed in fiscal 2019 and the benefit of share repurchases anticipated in fiscal 2020. We anticipate revenues and results of operations to be currency neutral.  Concerning the cash flow, we expect free cash flow of approximately $2.8 billion to $3 billion, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses between $500 million and $700 million. The free cash flow expectation reflects the favorable timing realized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. In closing, we’re pleased with the results of our fiscal fourth quarter performance and the execution against our strategic priorities. While the external environment presents many headwinds, we’re making important progress. Our efforts to drive productivity, execute on initiatives to deliver savings to fund investments for growth, simplify our organization structure and increased accountability are all aimed at delivering balanced top and bottom line growth that creates value for our shareholders. We know we have more work to do, yet we are pleased with the progress. We look to build on the momentum of our third and fourth quarter operating performance and remain confident in our business as we enter fiscal 2020. With that Brian and I would be happy to take your questions. And I’ll turn it back over to the operator.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Robert Jones: Great, thanks for the questions. I guess just to start on the U.S. Pharma business around guidance and specifically around branded inflation, was wondering if you guys be willing to share what the assumption around inflation is that is assumed in guidance? And then more importantly, I was hoping you could provide us an update on how you feel generally around the branded portfolio and renegotiations with branded manufacturers, you have Britt both on the fee-for-service side as you mentioned, but also on that 5% that’s still contingent upon inflation.
Britt Vitalone: Well, good morning Bob. And thanks for that question. Let me see if I can answer those in order. In terms of our guidance for the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, as I mentioned, our assumption around branded price inflation is mid-single digit. And that’s really in line with what we’ve been experiencing here in our fourth quarter and it’s really aligned with fiscal 2019. Our conversations with our manufacturing partners continue to be very productive, we have conversations with our manufacturing partners on a regular basis, we feel like we’re very well-positioned in those conversations. And there’s nothing in our conversations today that would suggest anything different from the guidance that I provided you. As it relates to the contingent portion, again, I wouldn’t point to anything new here. We continue to have really constructive conversations with our manufacturing partners and we’re really feeling like that fiscal 2020 sets up pretty similar to fiscal 2019.
Robert Jones: Great. And I guess just a quick follow-up, you guys highlighted corporate expense obviously taking a step up, it sounds like in large part because of the ramping opioid litigation. Could you maybe just talk a little bit about the visibility you have into what those expenses will be specifically in 2020? And as we think about where we stand in the timelines of some of those larger cases, it seems like, some of them, the bigger ones are poised to go to trial in 2020 and obviously could be in expense for some time beyond that. Any sense you can give us on how you’re thinking about the run rate around these costs as we move, not just in 2020 but beyond 2020?
Britt Vitalone: Yes, well thanks for that question. Let me start and then I’ll have Brian add some commentary here. As we were going through last year, we provided you the best guidance that we had for fiscal 2019 and we talked about opioid related costs being in excess of $100 million for FY2019. As we said, our guide, again, what we’re doing is giving you the best visibility that we have to those costs. I outlined that as $150 million for FY2020. It’s very difficult to forecast these out, these really are dependent on the speed of the trials, the decisions that the judges make along these cases and it’s hard for us to predict that. And so what we’ve done here is given you our FY2020 view as we sit here today on how we think those trials might progress and what we think those costs might be to defend in those litigation proceedings.
Brian Tyler: Alright, I think, you covered it well Britt. It is difficult to forecast exactly. It’s the little bit of art and a little bit of science obviously. We’re prepared to make the investment we need to make to prepare a proper defense and protect our shareholders’ interests. As information unfolds and judges decisions and schedules and proceedings occur, we’ll be committed to keep this group updated. I would say in general, I think, if you look at the operating expense environment and discipline in the core operations, I’m very pleased with the trajectory and the progress that we’re making. It is being offset by investments in opioid defense and some very specific targeted investments we’re making into the business as part of our strategic growth initiatives.
Robert Jones: Great, thanks for that.
Brian Tyler: Thanks Bob.
Operator: Our next question will come from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Eric Percher : Thank you. Last year we were talking about a lot of unique headwinds and seen significant that CVS is not considered a unique headwind. Brian, I’d be interested in your perspective on what makes for unique or not and whether there is any change to the scope of that relationship. And Britt, it would be helpful if you have any commentary on the cadence of earnings given some of the renewals, and onetimers and acquisitions that are contributing.
Britt Vitalone: Well Eric good morning and thank you for the question. Obviously we’re very pleased to be able to announce the renewal of our CVS agreement this morning. It’s a long time partnership that we’ve enjoyed with them. I would say that I don’t characterize this renewal as really any different than many of the others I’ve been through with CVS, in the years. These are big business relationships, complicated business relationships. And we worked through those discussions in a way that obviously we reached the feeling that it was mutually beneficial for us to continue to go forward. And so we’re really excited about our partnership with CVS and the economics of that renewal as always have been built into the numbers we shared with you this morning.
Brian Tyler: Eric maybe I’ll just answer your second question here. As we think about the progression of earnings over the course of the year we don’t provide quarterly guidance, but what I would say to you is that as we look at the year, you should expect that our earnings will be roughly the same first half to second half is what we experienced in FY’19.
Eric Percher : Thank you for the detail.
Operator: Our next question will come from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open, please go ahead.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi, this is Elizabeth Anderson on for Ross. Can you talk a little bit more about your expectations on Europe in the coming year? I know, obviously there are a couple of onetime items there, things that are unavoidable in FY’19. But sort of what gives you confidence in the profit growth trajectory for fiscal 2020?
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Elizabeth. Well, we obviously did take a charge of approximately $20 million in the fourth quarter in the UK. But I would say if you step back and look at Europe overall, we were really in line with our growth expectations in most of the countries. And we’re pleased with the performance. We feel like with the headwinds we’ve experienced over the past years in the UK and the management actions that we’ve taken, which includes really, building a new leadership team there, a rationalizing our store portfolio, restructuring the operations, is the work we’ve done that gives us, gives us confidence to feel that we can, you know, get Europe back to very modest growth next year.
Elizabeth Anderson: Okay, perfect, that’s really helpful. And I also wanted to ask you a question in terms of the upside in your cost cutting program, are there any particular areas that you’re seeing additional dollars coming from or any other color you could provide there would be very helpful?
Britt Vitalone: Yes, thanks for that question. I think as we’ve talked about before, there are several areas that we were really focused on as we think about not only cost cuts and spending behaviors and disciplines themselves, but also we’re going through some operating model optimization efforts in our finance operations, in legal HR and our technology and we’ve also talked about investments that we’re making in technology, and data and analytics.  We’ve also talked about some things in our finance operating model like the partnership with Genpact as we’ve expanded that. So I wouldn’t think of it just as cost cutting. Spend discipline is important, it’s important component to that. But we’re also going through some operating model optimization capabilities and we’ve made some really great progress, particularly in the areas of technology and in finance. In the area of technology, we’re in a position now to reinvest back into that, invest in infrastructure and also invest in data and analytics capabilities.
Elizabeth Anderson: Perfect. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question will come from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Kevin Caliendo: Hi, good morning, everybody. Thanks. I want to get back to the U.S. Pharma business and your guidance there. It assumes, if I’m thinking about this right, I think, it assumes margins to be pretty flattish year-over-year. And I understand there’s some synergies from M&A and some other improvements and growth in specialty and the like. If you can breakdown sort of what your expectations are for generic profitability and the spreads there, like what have you been seeing versus maybe margins and some of the other segments within U.S. Pharma?
Britt Vitalone: Thanks for that question, Kevin. I’ll start and what I would say to you as a starting point is we’re pleased to be able to provide an outlook for our U.S. Pharma and Specialty Solutions segment which returns to growth next year. And I think that’s on multiple dimensions. We’ve certainly made some advances in our specialty business and continue to see good growth there. As we talked about, we’re seeing relative stability in the manufactured price increase area of our business. And as it relates to generics, we don’t provide specific guidance on inflation or deflation rates. What I would tell you though is that we are very comfortable with the sourcing capabilities that we have through ClarusONE and continue to drive good value out of that. And on the sell side, we have great compliance with our customers. We utilize our capability and scale from ClarusONE to provide really good value to our customers. And we believe that we’re continuing to create an appropriate spread, which is in a market that is competitive yet stable. And so we’re very comfortable operating in that environment. And overall, that leads us to be able to provide you an outlook for the segment that has low-to-mid single-digit growth in 2020.
Kevin Caliendo: And just one quick follow-up, speaking of outlook, it feels to me like this guidance is a little bit narrower than we’ve seen recently, especially given the higher number. What would cause guidance to come in at the high end of range versus low end of range, given what you’ve provided us so far? What’s $13.85 versus $14.25, like what needs to happen?
Britt Vitalone: First of all – yes, thank you, Kevin. First all it is narrower than the guidance that we provided last year. We have certainly put together plans and constructed these plans with a lot of really good information and visibility into our business units. I think as you think about the top end of the range, certainly continued growth in our Specialty business would propel us there. We’ve had very strong growth in our Medical-Surgical business, continuing to grow patient home delivery and the investments we’ve made there, we call those out. We think that those are going to deliver some upside in 2020 and beyond. And our ongoing cost management efforts will take hold as we get further into the period to FY2021. On the downside, I think, things that could happen could be the outcome of U.S. drug pricing reform or additional regulatory impacts in our international market, which, again, we called out, we are not contemplating those, but those are things that could happen that drive us to the lower end of that range.
Kevin Caliendo: All right, thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question will come from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Cherny: Good morning. And thanks for taking the question. Brian, you talked before about the CVS renewal and how – wasn’t that different from previous one. That being said, you’ve recently renewed three of your largest customers, CVS, Rite Aid, VA against the backdrop of some of these drug pricing dynamics. You’ve also talked about your engagement with brand inflation manufacturers. How do you think about the conversations that you went into them and thinking about the trade off of services, versus price, versus volume commitments in this new drug pricing world? And was there anything that given the moving piece on drug pricing you are able to essentially pivot the conversation on.
Brian Tyler: Thanks for the question, Michael. Obviously, as we enter these discussions, we are well aware and informed of the regulatory environment as frankly were our customers. And as we have been evolving our model over the past years to think about how we think of different product, classes and the services we provide around those classes and the economics we get with those classes, that kind of all goes into the mix, and is the context in the backdrop for these conversations. As we think about the gross to net environment and things of that nature, I would remind folks that there is a little bit of a natural hedge on the buy and the sell side for us. But at least these are all well considered and well contemplated, frankly, on both sides as we entered into these agreements and we have baked the results of these renewals into the guide that we’ve reviewed to you this morning. And we’re very comfortable in the relationships and excited to extend our business partnership with both Rite Aid and CVS.
Michael Cherny: And then just one quick one relative to the share count guidance, it looks like if my math is correct, you are assuming a higher degree of buyback versus previous years of guidance. Does that have anything to do with your outlook on potential M&A targets relative to where you sit on a portfolio basis or the viability of what you see across the market?
Britt Vitalone: Well, again, I would just point to, as I mentioned, our share count assumption is 185 million at the end of FY2020. As Brian talked about and we’ve talked about in the past, we look at our capital deployment on a balanced perspective and trying to drive the most value for our shareholders. And as we think about FY2020, we think that capital deployment towards share repurchases is still an important component of that. And we believe that our share price is undervalued at this point, so that certainly is going to be a component of how we think about capital deployment.
Brian Tyler: I would just add, I don’t think the message should be that we don’t see good M&A opportunities, or good growth opportunities for this Company. We have had a good track record. And some of our recent deals, I think, have been highly successful for us. But what we are doing is really being very focused on where that M&A might occur and making sure it’s aligned with our strategic growth initiative and the three growth pillars that we have aligned. And we make those decisions, obviously, in the context of where our share price is today and what we think the relative attractiveness of share buybacks versus M&A are. So we do have good opportunities. We are and will continue to be active in looking for growth or capabilities that might come to us through M&A, but doing that in a very disciplined way.
Britt Vitalone: I think MSD is a good example of that that we completed in FY2019.
Michael Cherny: Great, thanks for the color.
Britt Vitalone: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: Our next question will come from Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Stephen Baxter: Hi, thanks for the question. I was hoping to get some additional insight into the [indiscernible] of the efficiency program. And can you help us understand how much of the cost savings was achieved in 2019? How much incremental you think happens in fiscal 2020? And then how much of that remains to benefit the numbers in 2021 and 2022? Thank you.
Britt Vitalone: Yes, thanks for that question. What we have told you is that we expect to have $400 million to $500 million of cost savings by the end of FY2021 full year. Comfortable raising that target given the actions that we’ve taken here in the last quarter, we haven’t provided specific year-to-year guidance on that. What I have said is that in FY2019 the savings that we generated were largely invested back in the business. We talked about our information technology infrastructure, and data and analytics capabilities. So you should view FY2019 as largely reinvested back in the business. As we progress through the time period over FY2020 and now FY2021, we would expect that those savings will increase over time and then you should expect to see more and more of those hit the bottom line, but we haven’t provided specific year-to-year or quarter-to-quarter guidance on the numbers.
Stephen Baxter: Okay, thanks. And just as a quick follow-up, I think, in the past you said of the cumulative program, most of it will drop through. Is there any update to that or is that still kind of the right way to think about it?
Britt Vitalone: That’s the right way to think about it.
Brian Tyler: And I think about it that we’re in the early phases of our efficiency initiatives are producing, we’re making a calculated decision in some instances to invest that back into the business. As those efficiency efforts continue to grow, the investments will begin to wane off, you’ll see a bigger impact.
Stephen Baxter: Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Charles Rhyee: Yes, hey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a question regarding sort of the rebate rule and sort of the role you see the distributors play. And then if I’m not mistaken, in some of the comments that the wholesalers have provided to GCMS here is sort of applying sort of a chargeback system that you have had in place with manufacturers for pharmacies to apply for – to apply this for the administration of point-of-sale rebates? Can you talk about sort of the capabilities that you currently have to do that today? How that it works for pharmacies and how quickly could that be applied for the use for consumers directly? Thanks.
Brian Tyler: Thanks for the question, Charles. So first off, I would remind everybody that the Part D safe harbor does not really impact our business model directly. We are not contemplated in that. So what we’re really talking about in the course of that reform is what are the implications for retailers and manufacturers, and then how might that ultimately impact us. We do think that we have some scaled and significant capabilities to help address the solution for this area. That would be not just the wholesaler chargeback infrastructure and technology, which really operates at big scale and highly efficient today, but also through our relay switch business. We are transacting 18 billion, 19 billion transactions at the pharmacy desktop each and every day – well, not each and every day, each and every year as we speak. And so while each one of those solutions by itself is probably not what’s going to be required to administer whatever comes out, and we think it will actually come out pretty soon in terms of a final rule. We think the underlying capabilities will be there. And so what we’re really looking for in the rule is what does HHS, say, relative to transparency? What are they going to stipulate in terms of the service providers that can support this? And frankly, what is the time frame for the implementation? And contemplating all those things, we will look at how we bring our capabilities which are unique to us, not all of them. We all have the chargeback capability but relay switch business is a little bit unique to McKesson. And if the opportunity is there for us to play a differentiated role or be part of the solution, that’s something that we would certainly, look to do. But we’ll also approach it with the seriousness that these are massively scaled transactions with big financial implications for all party and so anything that we would roll out would have to be robust, tested and reliable.
Charles Rhyee: And just a follow-up, I think one concern is particularly as you think about the application of point-of-sale discounts, this potential that particularly like pharmacies or independent pharmacies could be sort of caught on the wrong end carrying sort of a negative float here until sort of a true up on payments. Is that something where you see distributors potentially playing a role kind of supporting pharmacy customers using a balance sheet to sort of help them on the working capital side? Thanks.
Brian Tyler: Yes, really that’s a good question, and that’s one that we’re probably not prepared to answer right now until we see what the final rule looks like. I mean, I will say that we have long been an important part of supporting the independent customer base with a really broad array of solutions from helping on the reimbursement side of the business, helping with the cost, the reporting, obviously, generic procurement programs. And as this rolls out and we see what the impact and evolutions are, we’ll assess our capabilities whether they support the services, our balance sheet, figure out how to best support the independent and retail community pharmacy space. But it would be premature to make any definitive statements.
Charles Rhyee: Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Steven Valiquette: Great, thanks. Good morning, Brian and Britt. Thanks for taking the question. Just to come back for a minute here on the cost savings and the segment reporting. And just kind of thinking out loud for the $400 million to $500 million in cost savings, we’re assuming most of that does show up in the operating profit segment results for U.S. pharma solutions and European pharma solutions, but just curious if any material amount of the savings would show up in the corporate expense line over the next couple of years even though corporate expenses are obviously going up a lot in fiscal 2020. So it does seem like as you described some of the sources of savings, it does seem like some of that would fit into a corporate expense buckets. So just curious if there are some savings factored into that guidance in corporate expense for fiscal 2020. Thanks.
Britt Vitalone: Thanks, Steve, for that question. It’s great question, let me just clarify that. The cost savings programs that we put in place, which include the optimization of our operating models, are enterprise wide. So as we think about cost savings, it’s really disciplined on an enterprise basis which would include our corporate functions. As we think about our operating model optimization efforts, whether that’d be in finance, or technology or HR, clearly those will be enterprise wide as well. So as we think about, these are really holistic programs where we expect the benefits to have an impact not only within the segments, but also within our corporate expense line as well.
Steven Valiquette: Okay. One other quick one here just on the guidance. Normally, you guys will give some comments on contribution from new generic launches and I didn’t hear much about that for FY2020. [Indiscernible] have launched recently generic Advair and a few others, but just big picture, any view on profits from new generic launches FY2020 versus FY2019.
Britt Vitalone: Thanks for that question. Clearly there will be generic launches in every year. I think as we think about this, we don’t expect a material profit difference in FY2020 than FY2019 from generic launches. So there will be, what we would expect to be, a modest impact from generic launches in FY2020.
Steven Valiquette: Got it. Okay, thanks.
Brian Tyler: Thank you.
Holly Weiss: Operator, we have time for one more.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question will come from David Larsen with SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.
David Larsen: Hi. It looks like you are guiding pretty good operating profit growth for fiscal 2020 across all segments with the exception of other. Can you just remind me what is going on in other that is going to basically cause the entire enterprise’s operating income, it looks like to decline possibly to low-single digits in fiscal 2020. Thanks.
Britt Vitalone: Thanks for the question. As I talked about in my remarks, in fiscal 2019 in our other segment we had the benefit from the $90 million reversal of a contractual liability within our Change Healthcare business. And so that, obviously, we will be lapping that in fiscal 2020, that is the primary change. And that is really partially offsetting some good growth and some good expansion that we’re seeing, particularly in our MRxTS business.
David Larsen: Okay. And then with the opioid litigation costs, I mean, some of the numbers we’re hearing from these litigator are very, very high. Like, would you expect to include those cost of litigation in your adjusted EPS going forward beyond fiscal 2020 or would you view those as one-time items? Thanks.
Britt Vitalone: Yes, thanks for that question. What I would be prepared to say now is our guidance assumes the litigation costs and that number is $150 million. We don’t have any visibility into anything beyond that. So it would be inappropriate for us to really comment on it at this time. As things come up, or there are decisions that are being made, we’ll certainly provide that guidance and visibility to you. But as it relates to our guidance today, it’s the $150 million in opioid-related litigation costs, which are in our corporate segment.
David Larsen: Okay and then just the last one from me. You had $23 million of operating income in European Pharma Solutions this quarter. I mean, it looks like we’re expecting a pretty big rebound in fiscal 2020. Just, what’s going to drive that? And I’ll stop there. Thanks a lot.
Britt Vitalone: I would just remind you that we took a charge in the fourth quarter related to that business and we’ve also been hard at work in terms of optimizing our store portfolio, rationalizing our back office support functions and we think all of those will begin to yield benefit.
David Larsen: Okay. Congrats on a good fiscal 2019, Britt.
Britt Vitalone: Thank you.
Brian Tyler: Thank you, David. And thank you, operator. Unfortunately, we’re out of time. So I want to thank all of you who joined us on the call this morning, particularly those with questions. And we appreciate your support and interest in McKesson. We have a clear strategy and a solid operating plan for fiscal 2020 and exciting growth opportunities across McKesson. I remain confident in our future. Thanks again for joining us this morning. I’ll now hand the call to Holly for her review of upcoming events for the financial community.
Holly Weiss: Thank you, Brian. We will participate in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Healthcare Conference in Las Vegas on May 14, and we will participate in the Goldman Sachs Global Healthcare Conference in Southern California on June 11. We look forward to seeing you in the new fiscal year. Thank you and goodbye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for joining today. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-01-31 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to today's McKesson Q3 Earnings Call. I'd like to remind everyone this call is being recorded. And at this time, I'll turn the floor over to Craig Mercer. Please go ahead, sir.
Craig Mercer: Thank you, Greg. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2019 Third Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; Brian Tyler, McKesson's President and Chief Operating Officer and incoming CEO; and Britt Vitalone, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will provide opening remarks. Brian will provide a business update. And Britt will review the financial results for the quarter. After Britt's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after 1 hour at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the next - please refer to the text of our press release and forward-looking statements slide for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, we will reference adjusted earnings, adjusted operating profit and margin and free cash flow and items excluding foreign currency exchange effects. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information for investors with regard to the company's operating performance and comparability of financial results period-over-period. Please refer to our press release announcing third quarter fiscal 2019 results and the supplemental slide presentation for further information and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. The supplemental presentation is useful in reviewing the fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018 results discussed today. Finally, for those who have not yet met her, I would like to introduce Holly Weiss. Holly Weiss was recently appointed Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. My transition to Holly will be completed ahead of our year-end earnings call. On a personal note, I would like to thank John, Brian and Britt as well as the investment community for the opportunity to work with everyone over the last few years. And with that, thank you. And here is John Hammergren.
John Hammergren: Thanks, Craig. As you're probably aware, as he just mentioned it, this is his last earnings call. I want to thank you, Craig, for your invaluable service to our team over many years and in various roles, and I wish you the best in your future endeavors. And Holly, welcome as you -- as our new Head of Investor Relations. And thank you all for joining us on our call today. This is my 79th earnings call with our investor community, and this call also marks my final earnings call as the leader of McKesson. I previously announced my retirement that takes effect at the end of our fiscal year. We are making solid progress with our strategic growth initiative. And despite some headwinds, the company is in a strong financial position. McKesson's future is bright. It's been my great honor and privilege to leave this company as Chairman and CEO for nearly 20 years. Together, we've created an organization that plays a unique and significant role in health care. No one is better equipped than Brian to lead McKesson into the future. He is a gifted leader and an innovator, with deep industry knowledge and unwavering commitment to customers' success. He has a strong vision for the future of health care, both in the U.S. and globally, as well as for how McKesson will continue to play an integral role in helping improve efficiency and effectiveness for patient care delivery. Perhaps most important, Brian personifies our ICARE shared principles. In fact, he helped me create them as a member of my leadership team nearly 20 years ago. Throughout his tenure at McKesson, he has always placed the enterprise first, focused on teamwork, collaboration and communication and has consistently made employee engagement a high priority. I know that Brian is a right leader to take McKesson into the future. In addition, I might add, he is a great husband and a father as well as a friend and a trusted adviser of mine. With my retirement, McKesson will be splitting the role of Chairman and CEO. Ed Mueller, our current lead independent Director will become McKesson's new independent Chairman effective April 1 and has developed a thorough understanding of McKesson over his 10 years of service and serves as a respected leader and will provide continuity for our board. Over the balance of the fiscal year, the entire board and I will work closely with Brian and Ed to ensure a smooth transition. And after April 1, I will continue to support McKesson in an advisory capacity, and I'll remain Chairman of the Board of Change Healthcare. I'll be forever grateful for the many things we've accomplished together as a team here at McKesson and for the incredible friendships I had made along the way. McKesson is truly a special place with our rich history, innovation, culture, and most important, our people. Every day, I'm humbled by the opportunity to leave this great organization, and together with our employees, make a positive impact across health care. I might also mention that with many of you I've worked for years, and I want to thank you for your support overall all of these years and your friendship in some cases. You've always treated us with great respect. You've asked tough questions, but fair questions. And we've attempted to be as transparent as we possibly can. So I appreciate the support. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian?
Brian Tyler: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to be the first, probably of many, to recognize and congratulate John for the lasting impact he has had on McKesson. He and I, as he mentioned, have been colleagues and friends for a long time, and I am truly humbled by the opportunity to succeed him as McKesson's CEO. His leadership and vision for the past 20 years have allowed McKesson to achieve the level of success that few companies ever accomplish. I'm excited to build upon his legacy. I've had the privilege of running nearly every major business in McKesson as well as leading our corporate strategy function. I know our teams. I know our capabilities, our markets, our customers, and importantly, our employees well. To lead McKesson at this point in time is energizing, and I look forward to advancing the tremendous culture, solid foundation and global platform established by John and his team. The health care industry continues to undergo change as we focus on addressing affordability, access and quality outcomes for patients. I'm confident that McKesson is the partner of choice for biopharma, providers and pharmacies in all segments across health care to help improve the delivery of health in our communities. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, our strategic growth initiatives are gaining momentum. Most of the top leaders within McKesson were involved in developing our strategy to accelerate growth, supported by cost savings initiatives and operating model efficiencies, like our recently announced headquarter's move to Las Colinas. To succeed in today's evolving market, we will need to find new ways to innovate, speed up decision-making and empower our teams so that we can provide even better value to our customers and patients everywhere. More than 20 years ago, John helped guide our company through a time of crisis and showed us what leadership and resilience look like. Fast forward to today and McKesson's success can be seen both by the financial health of the company and our culture of doing what's right and putting the patient first. I believe our culture truly is a competitive strength of McKesson. We thank you for that culture, John. We thank you for your tremendous leadership and accomplishments. On behalf of all 78,000 employees, we send a very big thank you, a very big congratulations, and of course, just huge wishes for happiness in whatever is next for you. You will be missed greatly. You'll always be warmly remembered and regarded. Now turning to the quarter. For the third quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $56 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.40, which were ahead of our expectations. As a result, we are narrowing our fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings per diluted share range to $13.45 to $13.65 from the previous range of $13.20 to $13.80. We have reduced the top end of our guide to reflect the $0.26 impact of a customer bankruptcy that Britt will discuss in more detail. And we have raised the lower end of our guide based on the solid Q3 results and early indicators of our fourth quarter performance. A few comments on our business results. Our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment had year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter of 6%. Last month, Rite Aid renewed their distribution and sourcing relationship with us for another 10 years, as we had contemplated in our guidance. We're, of course, pleased that Rite Aid continues to see the value we deliver in our partnership through our industry-leading service levels, which translates to better experiences for their patients and customers; through our competitive pricing; and through our efficient operating model. All of this helps them to succeed, and their decision further validates our sourcing scale and service levels following Rite Aid's extensive and competitive evaluation process. As it relates to reform, we continue to monitor proposals and share our perspective and collaborate with the administration, policymakers and trade associations. And we've been in discussions with our biopharma partners and customers on opportunities to address the shared concerns of the administration around affordability, access and quality. As the administration implements new strategies that transition from volume to value-based reimbursement, we regularly demonstrate our ability to support our customers and improve patient care delivery. As a recent example, The US Oncology Network received incremental payments from both the Oncology Care Model and the Merit-based Incentive Payment System, sometimes referred to as MIPS, reflecting the value we provide to our physician partners. We, at McKesson, continue to believe that community-based care is the best way to address these goals and that value-based care models are important tools to drive improved patient outcomes. We expect that as various reimbursement changes are considered, the value of community-based care will continue to be recognized. Now turning to McKesson Europe. In the third quarter, we appointed Kevin Kettler, a 13-year McKesson veteran, as Chairman of the Management Board of McKesson Europe. Kevin previously was President of Global Procurement and Sourcing. He managed the international team responsible for growing McKesson's private label generics business, which is a priority in Europe. Additionally, Kevin served in multiple leadership roles in corporate strategy in U.S. Pharma over the years. He brings deep experience in pharmaceutical distribution, procurement, marketing and retail pharmacy to the new role in Europe. Let me provide some color on Europe's operating performance in the quarter. Seasonality and market growth in all countries, except the U.K., drove an improved sequential and year-over-year performance. While most of Europe continues to perform well and grow, the U.K. business does face challenges. The actions we took last year to rationalize our store footprint and streamline our back-office operations only partially mitigated the U.K. government cuts. We previously mentioned that prior reimbursement cuts in the U.K. were in excess of historical levels and greater than we had planned for in our initial fiscal 2019 guidance. We're currently evaluating the recently released NHS Long Term Plan and were modestly encouraged by the general increase in health care funding that it proposes. While we're pleased to see the important role of pharmacy in the plan, we believe it's premature to expect a near-term return to growth, particularly given the generally weak retail environment and the uncertainties of Brexit. The U.K. team is working closely with internal and external stakeholders to evaluate the government dynamics and operating environment, making further changes intended to return the business to growth. We remain committed to ensuring the long-term profitability of this business. Now some comments on our Medical-Surgical business. Medical-Surgical continues to be a real good story for us, reflecting strong market growth, incremental scale from our recent MSD acquisition and benefits from an ongoing shift to lower cost sites of care. I'm particularly pleased with the segment's performance this quarter, especially when comparing the more normalized flu season experience so far this year against the unusually strong flu season last year. And looking further ahead, we continue to expect incremental synergies from our MSD acquisition as we integrate operations. This acquisition directly supports our strategic growth objectives of increasing our value proposition for our manufacturer partners and expanding our solutions related to specialty pharmaceuticals. Finally, McKesson Canada, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions and our equity investment in Change Healthcare, all included in Other, saw upside in the quarter, driven by organic growth and mitigating actions in Canada to address previously discussed government generic price actions. During the quarter, McKesson Canada continued its progress on mitigating the impact of government-imposed generic pricing cuts that went into effect April 1, 2018. And together with strong organic growth in our McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions business, we were able to offset slightly lower adjusted equity contribution from Change Healthcare. And specifically regarding Change, as we've mentioned before, to the extent market conditions are suitable, we continue to expect an IPO in the first half of calendar 2019. Before I turn it over to Britt to provide more detail on the performance of each of these businesses, I wanted to spend a minute just to discuss the opioid litigation and epidemic. As it relates to litigation, the timing for conclusion of the myriad of cases remains uncertain. The magnitude of litigation expense is determined in part by the schedule set in these cases and underlying activity, which is not in our control and therefore difficult for us to project. We do take our fiduciary responsibility to our shareholders seriously. We will continue to evaluate the cost of all our options as the litigation in different jurisdictions progresses. We were encouraged by a recent decision dismissing the claims of 21 municipalities in Connecticut, finding the lawsuit to be inappropriate means to recover societal costs associated with addiction. As for the ongoing epidemic, I, as many of you, I'm sure, are deeply concerned about the devastating impact it's having on the lives of so many people, including friends and families of McKesson. Our teams are working on solutions. Last year, Congress passed the SUPPORT Act to address electronic prescribing, electronic prior authorization as well as some provisions related to ARCOS data, opioid production quotas and suspicious orders. Many of the provisions mirror recommendations previously made in our opioid white paper. We also launched an Opioid Foundation that will focus on helping advance solutions to the nation's opioid crisis and is led by a distinguished physician with relevant public policy and addiction treatment experience. I'm very proud of McKesson's efforts to combat this epidemic and to support solutions for the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Britt and will return to address your questions when he finishes. Britt?
Britt Vitalone: Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon. Today, my comments will focus solely on our third quarter results and fiscal 2019 guidance. We will provide guidance for fiscal 2020 when we report fourth quarter results in May. As Brian discussed earlier, we are pleased with our fiscal '19 third quarter results, which were ahead of our expectations. We continue to make very good progress on our strategic growth initiatives, operating model and cost optimization program. As a result of this performance, we are narrowing our fiscal '19 adjusted earnings outlook to $13.45 to $13.65 per diluted share in fiscal '19 from the previous range of $13.20 to $13.80 per diluted share. Let's jump right into our third quarter results. Third quarter adjusted EPS of $3.40 was flat compared to the prior year, which was primarily driven by a lower share count and growth in our Medical-Surgical business, offset by higher tax rate, lower profit contribution from our U.S. Pharmaceutical business and higher corporate expenses. Let me take a minute to discuss tax as it relates to the higher tax rate compared to the prior year. I'll remind you that our adjusted tax rate in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 of 11.5% included discrete tax benefits of approximately $54 million as well as the cumulative catch-up adjustment related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 to reflect the new lower federal tax rate of 21%. In addition, McKesson's fiscal 2018 adjusted tax rate was positively impacted by the intercompany sale of software related to our former Technology Solutions segment in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Now let's turn to the details of our consolidated third quarter adjusted earnings, which can be found on Slide 10. Consolidated revenues for the third quarter increased 5% versus the prior period, primarily driven by the growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment and acquisitions. We now anticipate low single-digit percent consolidated revenue growth. Third quarter adjusted gross profit was up 5% year-over-year, mainly driven by growth in our Medical-Surgical and U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segments, including acquisitions. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses were up 8% year-over-year due to charges related to the bankruptcy of Shopko in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment and acquisitions, partially offset by the reversal of an accrual related to the state of New York Opioid Stewardship Act and ongoing cost management. Let me take a moment to provide more detail on the customer bankruptcy and the reversal of the New York accrual. First, we reported $60 million in pretax charges, principally related to accounts receivable with Shopko, who recently filed for bankruptcy. This amount represents substantially all the exposure related to this customer. We believe this would correlate to an approximate $0.03 impact to the fourth quarter. While we took steps to manage payment terms and we worked closely with Shopko to ensure we were paid for the products and services delivered, we believe there is risk in our ability to secure full payment and therefore recorded charges during the quarter. We'll continue to pursue payment, and we'll provide an update on our progress on our next earnings call. Second, as I detailed on our last quarter's call, while the New York Opioid Stewardship Act was being challenged in court at that time, McKesson reported an accrual in both our GAAP and adjusted results to account for our estimated portion of the annual assessment. In mid-December, District Judge in New York ruled the legislation unconstitutional and thus unenforceable. As a result of this ruling, McKesson reversed all previously reported charges totaling approximately $17 million. We will continue to track this matter following an appeal filed earlier this month. While we benefited from the favorable ruling in reversal of the charge for New York recorded in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, it was more than offset by higher opioid-related litigation expenses in corporate. For the third quarter, we recorded net opioid-related adjusted operating expense of $20 million and year-to-date $81 million. For fiscal 2019, we continue to anticipate that opioid-related costs will exceed $100 million. Turning back to our consolidated results. Adjusted income from operations was $918 million for the quarter, a decrease of 2% from the prior year. We now anticipate adjusted income from operations will decline in the low single digit year-over-year. Interest expense of $67 million in the quarter was flat compared to the prior year. And our adjusted tax rate was 15.3% for the quarter, mainly driven by discrete tax benefits of $58 million resulting from tax planning initiatives and our mix of business. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate assumption is approximately 17% to 19%. This guidance takes into account our latest assumptions regarding income mix as well as other onetime items in fiscal 2019 that we do not expect to reoccur. Income attributable to non-controlling interest was $57 million for the quarter, a decrease of 2% compared to the prior year. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations totaled $664 million, with third quarter adjusted earnings of $3.40 per diluted share, which is flat compared to $3.41 in the prior year. Wrapping up our consolidated results. Our third quarter diluted weighted average shares were 195 million, a decrease of 6% year-over-year. During the quarter, we completed $500 million of share repurchases, and we continue to expect diluted weighted average shares for approximately 197 million for the year. Next, I'll review our segment results, which can be found on Slides 11 through 14. And let me start now with U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions. Revenues were $44.3 billion for the quarter, up 6%, driven by market growth, including strong growth in oncology-related pharmaceuticals and acquisitions, partially offset by previously disclosed customer losses and branded to generic conversions. The segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter was down 2% to $593 million due to charges related to the customer bankruptcy discussed earlier and previously announced customer losses, partially offset by growth in our specialty business and the reversal of a charge related to the state of New York Opioid Stewardship Act. Excluding the impact of the customer bankruptcy-related charge and the reversal of the charge related to New York Opioid Stewardship Act, we would have seen year-over-year growth in segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter. Segment adjusted operating margin rate was 134 basis points, a decrease of 10 basis points. For the third quarter, brand compensation was in line with our expectations. Additionally, based on manufacturer price actions taken in January, we continue to be confident in our full year fiscal 2019 assumption, our brand price inflation in the U.S. to be in the mid-single-digit percentage range. I would remind you that our branded pharmaceutical contracts are primarily of a fixed rate in nature. And as a result, our brand compensation is less impacted by brand price increases when compared to our historical experience. For full year fiscal '19, we now anticipate a low to mid-single-digit percentage decline in adjusted operating profit for the segment. This represents an improvement from our prior expectations, driven by our third quarter operational performance. Next, I'll review European Pharmaceutical Solutions. Revenues were $6.9 billion for the quarter, down 1%, negatively impacted by $228 million from currency rate movements. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues were up 2%, driven by strong performance outside of the U.K., partially offset by the previously disclosed reduction in owned retail pharmacies following the closure or divestiture of approximately 200 stores and a challenging operating environment in the U.K. We now anticipate full year revenue for the segment will be flat compared to fiscal '18. Segment adjusted operating profit was down 19% to $69 million. On an FX adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit was down 16% to $71 million. While our U.K. business was lower than the prior year, driven largely by the impact of the previously announced additional reimbursement cuts and market conditions in our retail business, the rest of Europe performed well, reflecting growth on a year-over-year and sequential basis. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 99 basis points on a constant currency basis, a decrease of 23 basis points. We continue to expect adjusted operating profit to decline year-over-year for the second half fiscal 2019 contribution, similar to what was reported in the first half of the year. Moving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $2 billion for the quarter, up 19%, driven by the Medical Specialty (sic) [Specialties] Distributors or MSD acquisition and solid market growth. Excluding the MSD acquisition, segment revenue was up 8%. Segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter was up 21% to $170 million, driven by solid operational performance, contribution from the MSD acquisition, improved cost of goods and operating expense leverage. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 845 basis points, an increase of 12 basis points. We now anticipate that the segment adjusted operating profit for fiscal '19 will be at the high end of our previously provided range of mid- to high single-digit percentage growth. Finishing our business review with Other. Revenues were $3 billion for the quarter, up 1%. Revenues were negatively impacted by $113 million from currency rate movements. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues were up 5%, driven primarily by market growth across the businesses in the segment. We now anticipate that full year revenues will be flat year-over-year. Other adjusted operating profit was up 5% to $224 million. On an FX adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit was $226 million, driven by growth in our Prescription Technology Solutions business or MRxTS, partially offset by the impact of previously disclosed government initiatives on our Canadian business. We now anticipate that adjusted operating profit will grow in the mid-single digits year-over-year, driven by the stronger-than-projected contribution from MRxTS. Closing our segment review with Change Healthcare. Adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $52 million for the quarter. As the company continues to make focused internal investments to expand new technologies, to enhance systems and deliver on synergy realization, we remain pleased with the operating performance of the business, which is in line with our expectations. And subject to market conditions, we continue to expect a calendar first half IPO. Next, McKesson recorded $138 million in adjusted corporate expenses, an increase of 29% in constant currency year-over-year, driven primarily by opioid-related expenses. Due to higher-than-anticipated opioid-related expenses, we now expect adjusted corporate expenses to increase by a high single-digit percentage year-over-year. Now that we wrapped up our results, let me discuss our updated fiscal 2019 outlook. We now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $13.45 to $13.65 per diluted share for fiscal 2019. Our updated outlook reflects the following: stronger-than-anticipated underlying performance in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, which includes the favorable ruling on the New York Opioid Stewardship Act; outperformance in our Medical-Surgical segment; and continued growth within our MRxTS business. These positive developments are partially offset by the customer bankruptcy I previously discussed, higher opioid-related litigation expenses and an updated assumption that foreign currency exchange rate movements will have a negative impact of up to $0.05 per diluted share. We are well positioned to continue to execute in our fourth quarter. I'll now review our working capital metrics and cash flow, which can be found on Slide 15. The receivables, days sales outstanding decreased 3 days to 24 days. Days sales in inventory decreased 1 day to 29 days. And days payables outstanding decreased 4 days in the prior year to 54 days. I'd remind you that our working capital metrics and resulting cash flow may be impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of a given quarter. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.8 billion. For the first 9 months of the fiscal year, McKesson paid $866 million for acquisitions, repurchased approximately $1.4 billion in common stock and paid $216 million in dividends. During the quarter, McKesson issued $1.1 billion in long-term debt, which will be substantially used to repay an upcoming debt maturity, with approximately $1 billion in short-term borrowings outstanding at quarter-end. McKesson generated $141 million in cash flow from operations. After deducting $405 million in internal capital investments, McKesson had negative free cash flow of $264 million. This result was in line with our expectations. In fiscal '19, we now expect internal capital investments at the low end of our previous range, between $600 million and $800 million, and free cash flow of approximately $3 billion. I'd remind you that typically during our fiscal third quarter, we experience a net use of cash, primarily driven by the build in inventory for the holiday season. In addition, in our fiscal fourth quarter, we typically generate more than 2/3 of our annual operating cash flow, with more than $3 billion generated in our final quarter 2 of the past 3 years. We also have a total of $3.7 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization, which demonstrates the confidence that we have in our business going forward and the conviction that the Board of Directors and the management team have that the company shares are an attractive investment opportunity. And finally, our Board of Directors approved our quarterly dividend of $0.39 yesterday, which will be payable to shareholders in April. Year-to-date fiscal 2019, we've returned more than $1.6 billion to our shareholders in share repurchases and dividends, reflecting our focus on providing returns to our shareholders, while also making internal investments and acquisitions to support our long-term growth. Let me now take a minute to update you on the optimization of our operating model and cost structure. As we announced earlier this month, McKesson has expanded its relationship with Genpact, the global professional services firm focused on delivering process transformation. The expanded relationship will accelerate McKesson's operating model and cost structure program redesign, which will simplify and standardize finance processes, while deploying leading-edge technologies that will drive improved effectiveness, efficiency and savings. This partnership in combination with other finance operating initiatives is expected to contribute up to 1/4 of the previously announced annual gross pretax savings of $300 million to $400 million, which are anticipated to be substantially delivered by the end of fiscal 2021. We expect that these savings will increase gradually over time and that a majority of these savings will flow to the bottom line. In closing, we are very pleased with the results of our fiscal third quarter performance and the progress against our strategic priorities. Despite a non-anticipated customer charge, our results exceeded our expectations, demonstrating our commitment to operational execution. Following solid third quarter performance, we now anticipate fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings per share of $13.45 to $13.65 per diluted share. We look to build on the momentum of our third quarter and remain confident in our business as we focus on a strong finish to fiscal '19. Lastly, I'd also like to thank John for his outstanding leadership. We're very fortunate to have worked with an incredible leader. John has done a tremendous job leading the company for nearly 20 years. As we now turn the page to Brian, I'd echo John's comments that he made in the press release today. We're well positioned, and I believe we're in very strong hands going forward with Brian. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions]
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And from Evercore ISI, we have Ross Muken.
Ross Muken: Good afternoon, guys and again John, congrats, it’s been a pleasure working with you over the years. So I know you probably haven't had a ton of time to kind of digest and prepare, but there obviously was a number of things that came out after hours from HHS around rebates and antikickback. And so it looks like they're trying to push forward with some of the proposals we heard earlier in the year. I guess, at a high level, I know this is something you feel strongly, you can sort of recruit the economics that goes into place. But I guess, how are you thinking about that in the context of just a disruptive force potentially, at least in the short term in the business, and how hard the government is going to push at least on this one piece?
Brian Tyler: Hey, Ross. It's Brian. Thanks for the question. I didn't see that flash across my e-mail screen as I walked into the conference room here. I thought we might get a question. First, let me say that we support programs that enhance access, quality and cost. And if we think about the wholesaler model and how our economics and the supply chain works, we're not directly predicated on the safe harbor in question. Our economics really come from the manufacturer and revolve around the fair value of the services that we provide to them. We continue to believe that we run a highly efficient distribution and supply chain service and that they, over the years, have reinforced that view. And through various evolutions in our market and our industry, we continue to be paid fair value for the services that we provide, and that's based on the conversations that we've been engaged in today. We continue to believe that, that will be the case. So I might also just comment that we are not just a supply chain company in terms of logistics, but a pretty sophisticated financial operation as well. And on behalf of our manufacturers today, we administer lots of contract prices between manufacturers and hospitals or manufacturers and pharmacies. And millions of -- literally millions of price item customer combinations today, we do it at scale and we do it with great accuracy. And in our pharmacy technology businesses that you heard Britt talk about in terms of their strong credit performance, we have very sophisticated at-scale pharmaceutical-related transactions, over 17 billion a year, connecting directly at the pharmacy counter. So clearly, we will continue to engage in conversations with our manufacturer and other partners as people shift through the implications of what has just come out. But I focus you back on -- we continue to believe that we deliver a very important service in the pharmaceutical supply chain. We continue to be paid for that service that has evolved over the years. We expect it will continue to evolve. But the net-net, we would expect we'll continue to be paid appropriately for the services that we provide.
Ross Muken: No, that's super helpful color. And just maybe relative to the quarter, is this -- I feel like all of the segments, sort of relative to your expectations, came in at least in line or maybe even a touch better in some places. Do you feel like this is sort of evidence of, aside from some of these pieces that -- the hiccups that come now, again, like what happened with Shopko, aside from something unusual like that, the underlying trends in each of your businesses that leave sort of that worst or flat and maybe in some cases are certainly maybe even a touch better. And we're starting to see that bottoming that hopefully should be the jump-off for growth eventually in sort of the out years?
Brian Tyler: Well, we were certainly pleased with the operational performance of many of our businesses in the quarter. And as we've talked over the past months, we did see brand inflation come in line with where we had expected it to. That was a good development and provides some good underpinning for us. We see the generic market as reaching some point of stabilization. It's always competitive, but it's competitive in the sense we feel confident, are comfortable historically. And we do think that the focus that we've had over the past few months on the operating models and the discipline is beginning to resonate across our businesses. So I think I would say I feel real good about the quarter -- the operational quarter that the business put up.
Ross Muken: Thanks so much, Brian.
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Ross.
Operator: And moving on, we have Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company.
James Auh: Hi. This is James Auh for Charles. It looks like the MedSurg business performed better than at least we had expected, and the margins improved 12 basis points year-over-year. Can you just talk more about what drove that margin expansion and maybe what gives you confidence to improve the outlook, as evidenced by your revised segment operating profit guidance?
Brian Tyler: Thanks for the question, James. And we were pretty pleased with medical business. I would characterize it as pretty solid performance really across the business. Most of our segments performed on or ahead of where we had expected them to. We performed well on the gross profit line. I think we saw them upside from expenses, and this is an environment where we're operating in a normalized flu season, where in a typical year, we would expect a little more tailwind from flu. We're in more normal than, say, last year's really strong season. And I think part of it is just good execution. We're obviously continuing to benefit from the MSD acquisition. And as we progress in the integration of the MSD acquisition, we feel good about the progress we're making, and it continues to be on track. So I look at the medical business and just feel a pretty solid performance really up and down the P&L.
John Hammergren: And I might just underpin that as I mentioned in my remarks, excluding the MSD acquisition, which Brian mentioned is performing well in terms of integration, grew at about 8% growth year-over-year. So that's really solid for our growth within the ongoing business really across that business. So 8%, excluding MSD, I think it really underpins Brian's comments about the solid performance of that segment.
James Auh: Okay. Great. And also can you maybe talk about the reimbursement environment in the U.K.? Do you get any sense of visibility into any incremental cuts?
John Hammergren: Well, as I've mentioned in past comments, we always expect some level of reimbursement headwind. We have experienced in the prior few years abnormally high headwinds, I would say. That's clearly challenged the business. If I think about the current reimbursement landscape, there were -- the NHS typically does a 3-year plan, and this is the third year of the plan, and that plan would have called for them to push through some pharmacy-specific cuts, which they elected to not do, which we took as a mild positive that the NHS in tune with the landscape of community pharmacy in the U.K. Obviously, they've come out with the 10-year -- the NHS England's 10-year plan and community pharmacy was highlighted in that plan as having an important role in addressing cost, access and quality for them. This -- just this week, yesterday or maybe even this morning, in fact, NHS announced some incremental funding into the provision of community health around GPs, but also including other health care professionals, which we think just continues to reinforce their view of the importance of community provision of health and addressing the cost challenges of NHS. We're still digesting a lot of that. And I would not want to ever declare a victory on the reimbursement front, just given recent experience. But we would like to think that we've probably gone through the most significant of that. Now it's really a matter of how we continue to evolve the retail pharmacy model and to be a more integrated part of health care delivery in the communities in England.
James Auh: Great. Thank you.
John Hammergren: Thank you.
Operator: Moving on, from JPMorgan we have Lisa Gill.
Lisa Gill: Thanks very much. Good afternoon. John, I sincerely want to wish you the very best. I hope you enjoy time with your family. I may be the only one on the call today that has been on all 79 earnings calls with you from the beginning. So I will truly miss you, as you know. My question would be, though, Brian, you made a couple of comments. One, you talked about the Q3 being ahead of the internal expectations. Was there anything that was pulled forward from Q4? Because you also made a comment that the early indication of feeling good about where you stand for Q4. So I just want to understand if there was anything, #1, that was pulled forward? And then secondly, as we think about the fourth quarter, if there's any moving parts? Because if I look at the new revised guidance, it does come in kind of towards the lower end of where the Street is on the midpoint.
Brian Tyler: Yes, thank you, Lisa. I'll may be make a couple of remarks and then let Britt add some color. Just with regards to the performance of the business in Q3, I think I characterize it as pretty solid and feeling good across many of our businesses. I don't believe there was any unique pull forward, or I think of it as just core solid operating performance.
Britt Vitalone: And Lisa, maybe what I would add to that, I agree with everything that Brian said. As we think about Q4 and one of the things that I mentioned in my remarks is really around branded price inflation. And although we've talked a bit more of our branded, compensation is about 95% now fixed in nature and less variable, there still is that contingent part obviously that we've talked about briefly at JPMorgan. We feel comfortable on our mid-single-digit range. And again, we had very strong performance that we believe will continue in through Q4.
Lisa Gill: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Moving on, we have Eric Percher with Nephron Research.
Eric Percher: Thank you. Congrats to John and many thanks to Craig. For Brian and Britt, the question on opioids. I think the first part is, relative -- you've given some of the solutions that McKesson has taken part in. I'd be interested, Brian, to hear your perspective on the role that McKesson or a distributor plays and maybe some of the responsibility or limitations of responsibility that distributor should hold? And then, Britt, a $100 million in legal expense, that's a significant number. Is there a lot of early stage work, and will that ever inflow? Or is that where we're going to be for foreseeable future?
Brian Tyler: I'll take the first part of your question, Eric. And as you well know, it's -- the health care supply chains are incredibly complicated with lots of actors playing various different roles. I mean, as it particularly relates to opioid, we get the products to DEA-licensed pharmacies. They fulfill those based on scripts written by DEA-licensed physicians. And the DEA itself even controls the overall quantity of opioids in the marketplace. And so while we have a role in that physical supply chain, I would say that we would -- we feel like a disproportionate amount of the attention has been placed on wholesalers to this point.
Britt Vitalone: Eric, I'll take your second question. Again, we've updated our guidance on the opioid litigation costs. And again, we -- our best view on it right now is that it'll be in excess of $100 million for the year. I think it's challenging for us to really have visibility on what the cost could be over the longer term. These costs have continued to increase over the balance of this year. And I think as we think about going forward, projecting the cost going forward will be difficult. It will depend on a lot of different things. Decisions that the judge will make in the various cases, how the judge will schedule certain milestones in each of the cases. It is very difficult for us to predict how each of those situations will play out. So we'll continue to update you as we go forward. And what we've given you now is our best projection on those costs for at least for this year.
Brian Tyler: And we do take this responsibility in a very serious way. At this point, where we are, we think it's very important that we invest in the legal defense, that we get the best lawyers to represent us in that defense. And as Britt said, it's very difficult to predict where and how and when these things will evolve. But our commitment is to be good stewards of the capital that you have invested in us, and we will continue to keep you updated as the process unfolds.
Eric Percher: Thank you.
Operator: And next, we have Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut: Good afternoon, guys. Just a question on CVS on that contract. I mean, what are your expectations around the ability to retain the current services that you provide them? And then what are your thoughts on any additional services that you can provide -- yes, additional services that you can add to the contract?
Brian Tyler: Thanks, Brian. I'll start with we have a long-standing relationship with CVS. We've been long time partners. And we think that we service their business to the highest standards and levels that can be found in the industry. So we value and appreciate the relationship we've had with them over the years, and we would fully expect that we will continue that relationship. We are in discussions with them currently around the renewal and extension of that agreement. And like we've said many times, I think if you look at the industry, there's a pretty good track record of renewing these. And certainly for McKesson, we feel very strongly that our track record of renewing and maintaining these relationships is strong, other than the occasional loss from the acquisition-related activity. We think CVS well respects the work their associates do on their behalf. And so we enter into these discussions. We have every full expectation to renew it. Now we often talk about CVS as the big customer for the U.S. Pharma business, and that certainly is true. We also have relationships with them in our RelayHealth and some other parts of the company as well. So it's a pretty big broad comprehensive relationship overall, and we're optimistic that we will continue that relationship.
Brian Tanquilut: Thank you.
Operator: Next we have Michael Cherny with Bank of America.
Michael Cherny: Great. Thanks so much for the color today. I know it's addressed earlier in terms of the HHS and the rebate rule. I'm not expecting, as you said, a view on this. I think we've asked this question in the past, but when you talk about going back and making sure you get the appropriate compensation, what else goes into the conversation in terms of, is this creating an opportunity with your customers to explore new services, to pitch them on some of these things, whether it's CoverMyMeds and some of the other areas that they haven't passed me over the past? Are there others services that they're throwing back and asking you to try and pursue over time? Just trying to understand if a situation like this with uncertainty around how the pricing paradigms going to play out for pricing as a whole could create incremental strategic opportunities for the company that historically has been pretty active on the M&A front.
Brian Tyler: Yes, great. Thank you for that question. As I -- we think about addressing an issue like this. And when I think about health care, it's pretty fundamentally connected upstream, downstream. I mean, whether it's employers, payers, PBMs, wholesalers, retail pharmacies, it's a pretty interconnected system. And we're fortunate in McKesson that really have businesses, solutions and relationships across multiple of those constituents. So we tend to talk on these calls a lot about the dialogues we have with manufacturers, but we certainly have dialogues with those other constituent customers as well. And I think one of the great strengths of McKesson is breadth of reach that we have and the capabilities we have, including some unique capabilities like CoverMyMeds and RelayHealth, which we would think there is good potential for some opportunities. It's contingent, of course, on how this evolves. But when we meet with our partners, whether that's upstream or downstream, we try to bring the fully capability and complement of McKesson into those discussions, not to let it get narrowly focused on just one piece.
Michael Cherny: Thanks.
Operator: And next from Leerink, we have David Larsen.
David Larsen: Hi. Congrats on the good quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the Rite Aid renewal? Are those renewal rates reflected in this quarter's results or the new guidance for fiscal '19? And then can you maybe talk a little bit about the sell-side market environment as it relates to generic pricing? Thanks a lot.
John Hammergren: David, thanks for that question. I'll start, and then I'll Brian jump in. As we've talked about before, we were very pleased obviously with renegotiating or renewing Rite Aid for a longer period of time. We think that there's strategic opportunities for both of us. As we've also said, this was renewed within our guidance. So there will be -- with the guidance that we gave you today includes the renewal with Rite Aid.
David Larsen: Is it in the quarter? Is it fully reflected in the quarter, this quarter?
John Hammergren: Fully reflected in our numbers, in our results, yes.
David Larsen: Okay, great. And then can you may be just touch on generic deflation? Like how is that trending relative to expectations without getting too specific? One of your peers said mid-single to high single-digit deflation rates is what they're seeing. Is that what you're seeing as well or...
John Hammergren: Yes, we don't give specific ranges on the rates of generic deflation. But as Brian mentioned, we're seeing a more stable or more normalized environment around generics. Again, I think it's important to look at both the sell-side as well as the buy-side. On the sell-side, we are seeing a competitive marketplace, as we've seen for many years. And then we expect that to continue, but we're seeing a very stable environment. And then on the buy-side, we're very pleased with the performance that we have at ClarusONE. We think that, that entity is still performing quite well and it is providing us the opportunity to continue to work very closely with the manufacturers. And we think that the buy-side environment is more normal in terms of historical ranges, and it's a more stable environment than it has been several quarters ago. So we're very pleased with the environment that we're in. It's a competitive environment, but a more stable one.
David Larsen: Thanks. I appreciate it.
Operator: Next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser: Hi, good evening and John and Craig wishing you all the best and enjoy your time. And Brian and Holly, I'm looking forward to working with both of you. So Craig, this might be a question for you other than to congratulate you. When you think about it -- I know earlier in the call, you said that you're going to focus only on fiscal year '19. But I do note that starting next week, starting Monday, most of the questions we're going to get will be on fiscal year '20. So just if you can just help us think about this factor that we should consider -- I mean, obviously there is Rite Aid and CVS that you already talked about, which are likely to be headwinds next year. But how should we think about any other factors that we should consider, any other tailwind that you -- we factor in as we think about next year?
Craig Mercer: Yes. Thanks for the question, Ricky. Maybe another call, you can congratulate me on something.
Ricky Goldwasser: I hope that you have a long tenure going ahead.
Craig Mercer: Thanks for that. So I think as we've talked about, we're very pleased with the quarter, and there's a lot of things that both Brian and I outlined and we view as providing momentum as we go into Q4. And certainly, we feel very strongly about as we move forward. We talked about our medical business and we had very good performance in our medical business, not only from the acquisition of MSD, but the rest of the business performed quite well also. We talked a little bit about our McKesson Prescription Technology business, and we were certainly seeing good -- new product growth as well as good revenue growth in that business. And then our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions business, again, as we talked about, we had the customer charge in the quarter. Outside of that customer charge and the reversal from the New York State Opioid Stewardship Act, we would have had growth in the quarter. And so we feel that there's really strong growth underneath in that business as well. So there is a number of areas in our business that are performing quite well. We certainly feel good about the position that we're in as we close the third quarter and as we have momentum going into the fourth quarter. Those will be a few of the areas that I would point out to you right now.
Ricky Goldwasser: Okay. So nothing in '20. So let me ask you another question here. The -- obviously, the health care market is changing and may be faster than we'll anticipate and we would appreciate heading into this year. So Brian, from your perspective, as you look ahead, as you look at, matter of fact, your first year as a CEO of the business, what do you think is kind of like the one area or maybe the 2 areas that are going to be your top priorities? Or where you think that you're going to spend most of your time on? There's the opioids. There is -- obviously, the relationship with the manufacturers, a number of different things. So from your perspective, what are really kind of like the things that your key priorities will be?
Brian Tyler: Yes. Thank you for the question. It certainly is a dynamic time in our industry. And we often, I think in these calls, focus on clouds. And the fact of the matter is, when I look at McKesson and I look at the breadth of the businesses we have, I look at the reach in the channels, I look at the positioning in the community-based channels and the capabilities whether they're supply chain, whether they're software, pharmaceutical transaction or Medical-Surgical related, I think we've got this a tremendously broad set of assets and capabilities, unbelievably talented teams. And that change creates great opportunities for companies like ours that can bring these assets together in unique and differentiated ways on behalf of biopharma partners, on behalf of provider customers. I think to me that's the really exciting part of it, and that's the real opportunity that lies ahead. And so that's where I'll be spending my time, with our partners upstream, downstream and with our teams that are dedicated on delivering the value to those partners in and out every day.
Ricky Goldwasser: Thank you. And congrats, again.
Brian Tyler: Thank you, Ricky.
Brian Tyler: One last question?
Operator: All right. So the final question from Goldman Sachs, we have Robert Jones.
Robert Jones: Great. Thanks for sneaking me in John. Wish you the best Craig. It’s been a pleasure. I guess, Brian, just going back to this idea that you discussed that there are services that you are the wholesaler, provide for hospitals and other channels that aren't currently being leveraged in the retail channel. I heard something obviously very similar from one of your peers this morning. Obviously, the HSS news seems to be kind of pushing us towards this kind of net pricing world, which seems to play a part in this. Could you maybe just level set us and maybe just elaborate a little bit on what specifically the services are, that changing or current pricing dynamic would allow for a wholesaler to leverage into the core channel?
Brian Tyler: I think - the reality is we're going to see how things evolve here and how various constituents respond to the proposal that's been laid out. What I feel good about when I think about the capabilities at McKesson, and I mentioned this in my comments, is the fact that we do financial transactions, we do pharmaceutical transactions today in various parts of our business at scale with high accuracy, with really mature, developed, established incredible reputation for performance around those. And so I do think, as we looked how the markets will respond, how various segments will respond, we are in a good position to be able to provide solutions, kind of whatever that evolution is.
Robert Jones: Thank you very much.
Brian Tyler: Thanks, Robert. And thank you, Craig. I'd like to thank all of those of you on the call with us for your time today. I certainly look forward to engaging with you and the rest of our investor community going forward. I want to acknowledge John one last time, thank him one last time for just the terrific career accomplishment and the impression he has left on me and that I know he's left all across the teams of McKesson. He'll be greatly missed. I want to thank our employees for their dedication to our customers and partners in line with our ICARE value of putting the patient and the customers first in everything we do. In closing, I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us. McKesson continues to execute against our fiscal 2019 plan, and we look forward to updating you with our fiscal 2020 outlook in a few months' time. I'll now hand the call back to Craig for his review of upcoming events for the financial community. Craig?
Craig Mercer: Thank you, Brian. On Thursday, February 28, we will present at Leerink Partners 8th Annual Global Healthcare Conference in New York, and we look forward to releasing our fourth quarter earnings results in early May.

Operator: Good day, everyone. Welcome to the McKesson Q2 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Craig Mercer. Please go ahead, sir.
Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, and welcome to the McKesson fiscal 2019 second quarter earnings call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; Brian Tyler, our recently-appointed President and Chief Operating Officer; and Britt Vitalone, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update, with Brian making some introductory comments. And then Britt will review the financial results for the quarter. After Britt's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 9 AM Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release and forward-looking statement slide for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, John and Britt will reference adjusted earnings, adjusted operating profit and margin, free cash flow and items excluding foreign currency exchange effects. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information for investors with regard to the company's operating performance and comparability of financial results period-over-period. Please refer to our press release announcing second quarter fiscal 2019 results and the supplemental slide presentation for further information and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. The supplemental presentation is useful in reviewing the fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018 results discussed today. Thank you, and here's John Hammergren.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thanks, Craig, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. For the second quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $53 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.60. And we are narrowing and raising the low end of our fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings range to $13.20 to $13.80 per diluted share from the previous $13.00 to $13.80 per diluted share. I'd like to take a moment to provide an update on our board of directors and leadership team. Our board of directors welcomed Dominic Caruso as a new Independent Director in September. As the former Chief Financial Officer of Johnson & Johnson, Dominic brings with him significant financial and healthcare experience, which further strengthens the diverse backgrounds and perspectives we have on our board. Also, I'd like to welcome Brian Tyler to this call, following his appointment as President and Chief Operating Officer reporting directly to me. Many of you are familiar with Brian, as he has regularly presented at previous Investor Day events in Boston and has led nearly all of our businesses during his 21-year tenure at McKesson. I'll now ask Brian to talk about his vision around leading our global operations. Brian?
Brian S. Tyler - McKesson Corporation: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Well, I'm very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead of us. Clearly, there's a lot of work ongoing and work to be done. We have an impressive range of capabilities to build upon, combined with a great track record of execution. Having led corporate strategy and business development in many of our business units, I'm very energized about leading our operations as well as our strategic growth initiatives. We have faced and overcome many challenges during my time at McKesson. I continue to be encouraged by this company's resilience, its ability to navigate evolving market conditions and our strategic focus to improve long-term performance. Our enterprise-wide multi-year growth strategy, including priority areas that focus on manufacturer value proposition, specialty pharmaceuticals and the role of retail pharmacy, all supported by data analytics, are promising areas of innovation. And importantly, we already have strong foundational businesses from which to build upon. The anticipated growth in conjunction with streamlined and aligned operations is strategically and financially attractive. This focus positions us well for the changing landscape of healthcare. It allows us to leverage the strengths we've built in our world-class distribution platforms and services businesses, and we see substantial savings opportunities through the improved spend management, centralization of support functions and expanded outsourcing arrangements. Britt will discuss these operating model initiatives in more detail shortly. And with that, I'll turn the call back to you, John.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thank you, Brian, and welcome to your new role. I'm delighted to have you in this important expanded responsibility. Before I dive into the details of the quarter, let me briefly touch upon the evolving landscape across healthcare, primarily around drug pricing and our relationship within the supply chain. When I think about potential new developments, I step back and look at how we've adapted to and driven change in the healthcare industry, how we've broadened our capabilities well beyond the core function of distributing pharmaceuticals, how our services drive affordability, access and quality, supporting the value we deliver and how I think about future drug price changes. To take a deeper dive into these areas, first, all of McKesson's brand pharmaceutical purchases are done in partnership with biotechnology and pharmaceutical, or as we refer to them, biopharma companies; unlike the industry standard practice before we had these distribution service agreements. Our relationships between wholesalers and their biopharma partners are now governed and driven by these agreements and have been for several years. The partnership with biopharma companies has led to increased transparency and a more stable and predictable supply chain with inventory levels that are appropriate to meet customer demands and service levels. We've continued to evolve our relationships, reducing the economic variability in our distribution agreements and reducing our reliance on pricing decisions made by biopharma companies to approximately 5% of our total branded compensation. As many of you know, we have been revising our terms when we renew agreements with our supplier and customer partners to encompass the broad array of services and capabilities we offer. We've implemented differentiated pricing across each category of product we provide services for; specialty, brand, generic, biosimilar and OTC classes of medicine. Our approach is designed to provide our suppliers and customers with transparency into the unique dynamics of each product category as opposed to a blended approach. For almost two decades, we have expanded our capabilities beyond distribution and related services to support our partners at nearly every step in the product lifecycle. Examples include RelayHealth Pharmacy and CoverMyMeds, both technology businesses that help reduce the price of drugs and improve patient adherence. And with our newly rebranded manufacturer solutions business now called McKesson Life Sciences, we are taking another step forward to become the partner of choice for life science industry, driving successful commercialization, launch, and in-market solutions to connect patients to life-changing therapies. While we acknowledge there is more work to do, the nature of what we do every day is aligned with the objectives of the administration, which includes affordability, leveraging our global scale to provide patients with low-cost generics, access, delivering one-third of all prescriptions in North America and quality, ensuring safe and efficient access to prescribe therapies every day. Finally, while there is much speculation around potentially dramatic reform changes, we believe there will be gradual major transitions should there be any changes to supply chain dynamics. In summary, we are confident in our ability to navigate changes to the existing healthcare supply chain because changes to our financial model are not new. As was the case with the changes to the supply chain in the past, we expect our biopharma partners to work with us in collaboration with our customers to ensure a seamless transition to avoid disruption to patients. And we are proactively engaged in ongoing dialogue with our customers and biopharma partners in assessing the existing financial models. We also continue to have broader policy discussions with the administration, policy makers and various trade associations that are important to our business. Turning now to our business results, our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment had year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of 2%. I'd like to discuss a few highlights in this business. We're pleased with the performance of our McKesson Life Sciences business, as all top 20 biopharma companies utilize a majority of our best-in-class services, and we continue to expand those relationships, providing evidence that our offerings are resonating. The Department of Veterans Affairs exercised their option to extend our agreement for another two years, as expected in our guide. And ClarusONE continues to leverage our scale and our unique in-house sourcing capabilities. Turning now to McKesson Europe; on our last earnings call we mentioned increased competition in France, and that recently announced reimbursement cuts in the UK were in excess of historical levels, and greater than we had planned for on our fiscal 2019 guide. Facing the challenging market in the UK due to reimbursement cuts and declining prescription volumes, we took action last year to rationalize our store footprint and streamline our back-office operations. As these trends evolved in the UK, we continue to evaluate our footprint and cost structure and our UK colleagues remained committed to stabilizing the business and repositioning it for long-term profitability, all led by a newly-appointed president with more than a decade of industry experience. We see our global retail presence as a way to stem the tide of growing healthcare costs as we anticipate more services migrating from higher-cost locations into the lower-cost pharmacy setting, and we believe that pharmacist plays an important role in providing a range of healthcare services. Turning to our Medical-Surgical business; the underlying business continues to deliver consistent results benefiting from the shift of care to lower-cost sites. And of course, our recent MSD acquisition, which will contribute more meaningfully to earnings as we move from the integration phase to realizing anticipated synergies over time. As evidence of further enhancing our value proposition, we recently announced a technology solution that complements our existing connectivity capabilities, provides us with access to a broader customer base, and allows patients to get more control over their care and additional support with products delivered to their home. Allows home health and hospice providers to save time and money, and spend more time delivering patient care, and it allows payers to receive improved accuracy in billing, to facilitate more timely reimbursement. While many have alluded to the threat of new entrance, McKesson has been actively investing in our Medical-Surgical business to better serve patients and ensure we remain the trusted partner in the alternate site markets. In particular, we've made increased investments in home healthcare, adding to our home delivery capabilities, which is driving top-line growth. While this investment is dilutive to our margin rate today, over time these investments will drive increased adjusted operating profit growth as we optimize operations and further leverage our scale. And we are pleased with the response we're seeing from our efforts to improve patient care in the home. Finally, McKesson Canada, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions and our equity investment in Change Healthcare all included in other. We saw upside in the quarter driven by a reversal of a contractual liability, partially offset by previously-discussed generic price actions in Canada and the sale of our Enterprise Information Solutions business in October last year. During the quarter, McKesson Canada made great progress on mitigating the impact of the generic pricing cuts that went into effect April 1. And together with strong organic growth in our Canadian and McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions businesses, we were able to offset a lower-adjusted equity contribution from Change Healthcare. Britt will go into more detail on the performance of these businesses. Based on the McKesson fiscal second quarter results, we are narrowing and raising the low end of our adjusted earnings range to $13.20 to $13.80 per diluted share for our full-year fiscal 2019 outlook. Despite anticipated challenges coming into the year, we expect a stronger second half of fiscal 2019. And as I look beyond fiscal 2019, the actions we are taking in our UK businesses are focused on addressing the disappointing reimbursement dynamics we are facing with new leadership to drive improved performance. As we focus on putting patient care first, we're investing in our businesses like homecare delivery. Similarly, McKesson Life Sciences enables biopharma companies to connect their innovative therapies to the patients that need them. And what ties these examples together is our focus on the patient, under our multi-year strategic growth initiative, with the goal of improving care delivery and driving long-term performance. Before I hand the call over to Britt, let me touch upon the recent weather events that impacted the Southeastern United States. McKesson was fortunate to have avoided significant impacts to our associates, our operations, and our facilities from the devastation resulting from the recent storms and flooding. We are proud to have played a role in the emergency efforts, providing pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to the affected areas, despite very challenging conditions. Our employees and the McKesson Foundation have been extremely generous with their support for displaced residents and coworkers. We continue to aid in the recovery of our affected customers, communities and employees. With that, I'll turn the call over to Britt and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. Britt?
Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Thank you, John. Let's jump right into our second quarter results, and please note that unless stated otherwise, the underlying assumptions that were detailed in our fourth quarter press release are being reiterated today. As John discussed earlier, our fiscal 2019 second quarter results were ahead of our expectations. Turning to slide six of the presentation, second quarter adjusted EPS of $3.60 was principally driven by a lower tax rate, including a discrete tax benefit, a reversal of a contractual liability associated with our equity investment in Change Healthcare and a lower share count. These benefits were partially offset by incremental challenges in our UK and French businesses, previously announced customer losses, and increased litigation expenses related to opioids. Our second quarter adjusted earnings results excludes the following GAAP-only items; amortization of acquisition-related intangibles of $0.75 per diluted share, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments of $0.27 per diluted share, LIFO inventory-related credits of $0.08 per diluted share, restructuring and asset impairment charges of $0.34 per diluted share, and other adjustment net credits of $0.19 per diluted share. Before I continue with the review of our second quarter results, let me take a moment to discuss the increased opioid-related expenses, including anticipated costs for the remainder of fiscal 2019. Earlier this year, the State of New York adopted the Opioid Stewardship Act, which required the creation of an aggregate $100 million annual surcharge that's attributed amongst all manufacturers and distributors licensed to sell or distribute opioids in New York. The first annual surcharge is assessed for calendar year 2018, payable in January of 2019, and measured based on opioids sold or distributed in calendar year 2017. The New York Department of Health notified manufacturers and distributors of this new law in mid-May. Given the timing of this new law, we did not include an assumption for the potential impact in our fiscal 2019 plan. While this newly-adopted law is currently being challenged in court, we have recorded an accrual to account for McKesson's estimated portion of the calendar year-to-date assessment, should we be required to pay the stewardship assessment in January of 2019. This accrual is reflected in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment. It's recorded in both our GAAP and adjusted operating results. In addition, McKesson's a defendant, often named with pharmaceutical manufacturers, retail pharmacy chains and other wholesalers, in numerous cases alleging claims related to the distribution of controlled substances to pharmacies. McKesson's recorded expenses associated with these cases, which have far exceeded our initial expectations and are significantly higher than the charges incurred in fiscal 2018. These expenses are reflected within our Corporate segment and are recorded in both our GAAP and adjusted operating results. Total adjusted operating expenses from both the New York legislation and costs to support ongoing litigation were approximately $34 million in the second quarter and $61 million year-to-date. For fiscal 2019, we now anticipate these opioid-related costs will exceed $100 million. We'll continue to provide updates on these items as more information becomes available. Now let's turn to the details of our consolidated second quarter adjusted earnings, which can be found on slide 9. Consolidated revenues for the second quarter increased 2% versus the prior period on a reported and constant-currency basis, primarily driven by market growth and acquisitions, partially offset by previously-disclosed customer losses in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment. Second quarter adjusted gross profit was down 1% year-over-year, primarily driven by customer losses and our sale of the Enterprise Information Solutions business or EIS in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, partially offset by market growth and acquisitions. Second quarter adjusted operating expenses were flat year-over-year, primarily driven by acquisitions, offset by a reversal of a contractual liability and the divestiture of our EIS business. During the quarter, McKesson negotiated a reversal to a contractual liability associated with our equity investment in Change Healthcare. As a result, McKesson realized a pre-tax benefit of $90 million in both our GAAP and adjusted operating expenses within our consolidated P&L. Adjusted income from operations was $983 million for the quarter, a decrease of 6% from the prior year. We now expect adjusted income from operations to decline in the low-to-mid single digits year-over-year, versus our original expectation of flat-to-mid single digit growth. Interest expense of $66 million in the quarter decreased 4% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates, partially offset by short-term borrowings. Our adjusted tax rate was16.2% for the quarter, primarily driven by a discrete tax benefit of approximately $42 million and our mix of business. We now assume an adjusted tax rate of approximately 17% to 19% for the full year, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter. Additionally, income to attributable to non-controlling interests was $54 million for the quarter, a decrease of 2% compared to the prior year. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations totaled $714 million, with second quarter adjusted earnings at $3.60 per diluted share, which is up 10% compared to $3.28 in the prior year. Wrapping up our consolidated results, our second quarter diluted weighted average shares were 199 million, a decrease of 5% year-over-year. During the quarter, we completed $580 million of share repurchases, and we now expect diluted weighted average shares of approximately 197 million for the year. Next, I'll review our segment results, which can be found on slides 11 through 15. As a reminder, effective in fiscal 2019, McKesson revised its segment reporting structure. We report results in three main segments; U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, European Pharmaceutical Solutions and Medical-Surgical Solutions. All other businesses, which primarily include McKesson Canada, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions, and our equity investment in Change Healthcare are included in Other. As a reminder, in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2018, contribution from EIS is included in Other. EIS contributed approximately $120 million in revenues and $17 million in adjusted operating profit in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and $240 million in revenues and $34 million in adjusted operating profit in the first half of fiscal 2018. Let me start now with the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions. Revenues were $41.6 billion for the quarter, up 2% driven by market growth and acquisitions, partially offset by previously-disclosed customer losses and branded-to-generic conversions. Segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter was down 5% to $635 million, driven by customer losses and lower branded pharmaceutical compensation than the prior year, partially offset by strong growth across our specialty businesses, including acquisitions. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 153 basis points, a decrease of 12 basis points, driven by a growing mix of specialty pharmaceuticals. We continue to benefit from the dollar contribution of these products, although they're dilutive to the margin rate. Specific to brand compensation, we have lowered our assumption for branded pharmaceutical price increases in the U.S. to mid-single digit percentage from our prior assumption of mid-to-high single digit percentage. I would remind you that our branded pharmaceutical contracts are primarily fixed in nature versus variable, with the fixed component representing approximately 95% of the compensation we receive. I would also reiterate my previous comments at a healthcare conference in September. If in the second half of fiscal 2019, manufacturers do not take any price increases, the impact to our adjusted operating profit would be a range of approximately $75 million to $90 million, or approximately 2% to 3% of our adjusted EPS. We'll provide an update on the brand pricing environment when we report our third quarter earnings in late January. And as a result of our expectation for increased stewardship expenses in New York related to opioids that I discussed earlier and our updated expectations for brand pricing, we now expect to be at the low end of original fiscal 2019 guidance assumption of flat-to-down mid-single digit adjusted operating profit for the segment. Next moving on to European Pharmaceutical Solutions; revenues were $6.6 billion for the quarter, down 2%, negatively impacted by $68 million from currency rate movements. On a constant-currency basis, revenues were down 1%, driven by the previously-disclosed reduction in owned retail pharmacies following the closure or divestiture of approximately 200 stores and challenging operating environments in the UK and France. These items were partially offset by strong performance in the other countries that we operate in. Segment adjusted operating profit was down 40% to $53 million. On a constant-currency basis, adjusted operating profit was down 39% to $54 million driven primarily by the impact of the previously-announced additional reimbursement cuts and market conditions in our UK business, and increased competition in the French wholesale market. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 81 basis points on a constant-currency basis, a decrease of 50 basis points. As a result of the weak second quarter segment performance as well as our updated view that mitigation efforts will not materialize as quickly as originally planned, we now expect segment adjusted operating profit to decline year-over-year with a more similar contribution in the second half of the year relative to the first half. While we continue to experience challenges in this segment, we're encouraged by the performance we're seeing in most all the other countries that we operate in; however that contribution is not material enough to offset the challenges in the UK and France. Moving now into Medical-Surgical Solutions, revenues were $1.9 billion for the quarter, up 17%, driven by the MSD acquisition and market growth. Excluding the MSD acquisition, segment revenue was up 6%. Segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter was up 1% to $138 million, driven primarily by market growth, partially offset by $8 million of higher bad debt expense in the quarter. Segment adjusted operating margin rate was 708 basis points, a decrease of 111 basis points, reflecting our mix of business, including the growth in lower-margin products such as Rx, previously-discussed bad debt in the quarter, and our continued investment in the homecare delivery business, as well as the lower relative margin contribution from MSD. We are very pleased with the progress in integration activities of the newly-acquired MSD business. As we move through the integration phase and to executing on the synergies, MSD, like most acquisitions, will begin to deliver operating profit accretion. This is consistent with our previously-discuss assumption that the MSD acquisition will be modestly accretive for adjusted earnings in fiscal 2019. Finishing our business review with Other; revenues were $2.9 billion for the quarter, down 5%. Revenues were negatively impacted by $113 million from currency rate movements. On a constant-currency basis, revenues were down 1%, driven primarily by the sale of the EIS business, partially offset by market growth across the businesses in the segment and acquisitions. Other adjusted operating profit was up 24% to $300 million. On a constant-currency basis, adjusted operating profit was $310 million, driven by the previously-mentioned reversal through a contractual liability associated with our equity investment in Change Healthcare and growth in our Prescription Technology Solutions business, or MRxTS, partially offset by the impact of previously-disclosed government initiatives on our Canadian business, the lower equity contribution from Change Healthcare, and the sale of the EIS business. In Canada, our Rexall business faced some challenges in the quarter. Actions taken earlier in the year are not materializing as fast as we anticipated, resulting in a lower performance than expected. We remain confident and committed to this business and will continue to focus on addressing these challenges with an eye on long-term sustainability. Additionally, we previously identified the impact of government actions in minimum wage increases as a gross pre-tax fiscal 2019 headwind of between $100 million and $120 million and discussed our efforts to mitigate that impact. I'm pleased with the work of our Canadian team, who have identified and begun implementing action plans that we anticipate will offset more than half of the $100 million to $120 million gross headwind, the benefits of which are expected to be captured primarily in the second half of the year. Posing our segment review with Change Healthcare, adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $56 million for the quarter. We're pleased with the operational performance of Change Healthcare. Adjusted EBITDA performance was in line with our expectations for the quarter. This solid operational performance was offset by increased investments in growth areas, higher tax expense, and higher interest expense. Due to the second quarter results and our expectation that these below-the-line dynamics will continue, we now expect the adjusted equity contribution from Change Healthcare to decline year-over-year relative to our original guide of low-to mid-single digit growth, and we expect a more similar contribution in the second half of the year relative to the first half. We now expect other adjusted operating profit to increase year-over-year, driven by the benefit from a reversal of a contractual liability associated with our equity investment in Change Healthcare and higher-than-anticipated growth in our MRxTS business, partially offset by the lower equity contribution from Change Healthcare. Next, McKesson recorded $143 million in adjusted corporate expenses, an increase of 55% in constant currency year-over-year, primarily driven by opioid-related expenses and planned technology investments. As a result of the outlook for opioid-related expenses that I discussed earlier, we now expect adjusted corporate expenses will increase year-over-year. I'll now review our working capital metrics and cash flows, which can be found on slide 16. For receivables, days sales outstanding decreased one day to 26 days. Days sales in inventory decreased one day to 30 days, and days payables outstanding decreased two days from the prior year to 59 days. I'd remind you that our working capital metrics and resulting cash flow may be impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of a given quarter. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.1 billion. For the first half of the fiscal year, McKesson paid $840 million for acquisitions, repurchased $877 million in common stock, and paid $139 million in dividends. McKesson generated $318 million in cash flow from operations. After deducting the $248 million in internal capital investments, McKesson had free cash flow of $70 million, which was modestly ahead of our expectations. In fiscal 2019, we continue to expect internal capital investments of between $600 million and $800 million and free cash flow of approximately $3 billion. We also have a total of $4.2 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. And finally, our Board of Directors approved our quarterly dividend of $0.39 yesterday, which will be payable to shareholders in January. In terms of fiscal 2019 earnings progression, we expect that the fourth quarter will be our largest in terms of EPS contribution, which is similar to prior years. For fiscal 2019, we anticipate that our higher-than-expected second quarter adjusted earnings per share results and lower full-year adjusted tax rate will be partially offset by ongoing litigation and stewardship costs related to opioids and the lower profit contribution from our European business. As a result, we're narrowing and raising the low end of our fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings outlook. We now anticipate adjusted EPS of $13.20 to $13.80 per diluted share in fiscal 2019. Let me take a minute to update you on the optimization of our operating model and cost structure. We're focused on the alignment of our operating structure to support the growth initiatives that we have previously outlined. Additionally, we continue to focus on controlling our operating expenses, which will provide the flexibility to make investments into the business and drive operating leverage. Throughout the second quarter, we made progress furthering the priority to evolve our operating structure with particular emphasis in the areas of finance, technology, human resources and on indirect spend. We've made progress in several areas, but I'd like to highlight three. First, we are evolving our operating structure and related spend management. As a result, we've launched more disciplined and rigorous internal spend guidelines across the enterprise to support sustainable spend reductions. Second, we're transitioning several business unit functional and back-office services to a more centralized hub model, leveraging outsourcing and technology. This results in a realignment of functions to report in a more centralized manner, improving service delivery and increasing focus on our operations and on customers and patients. And third, we are accelerating technology adoption, including increasing the use of robotics processing automation, AI and data and analytics to deliver more efficient and accurate service and output. These efforts will generate meaningful savings for the organization, driving increased productivity and efficiency, allowing our teams to focus on higher-value activities for the company and for our customers. These are just a sample of the initiatives that are underway as McKesson transforms its operating model to drive cost savings. And we have line-of-sight to many more initiatives that will drive additional savings. McKesson expects that these initiatives will drive approximately $300 million to $400 million in annual pre-tax savings that will be substantially realized by the end of fiscal 2021. I'm extremely pleased with the progress we're making and the change that we're driving at McKesson. And most importantly, I'm energized by the commitment and engagement of our McKesson employees across the globe that are driving this effort. In closing, we're narrowing and raising our fiscal 2019 outlook of adjusted earnings to $13.20 to $13.80 per diluted share. We are making solid progress against our multi-year strategic growth initiative. While we faced incremental challenges in fiscal 2019, particularly in our European business, we anticipate that the second half of the year will ramp due to seasonality, organic growth, the realization of synergies from acquisitions and the benefits from mitigation efforts. Our leadership position and ability to execute combined with increased focus on reducing costs across the organization and investing in our priority growth areas, give me confidence in McKesson's future. And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I'd ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator?
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Caller, your line is open.
Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good morning and thank you for all the color so far. I want to tie a little bit into the broader picture of drug pricing. Britt, you reiterated your view on what happens at the beginning of the year, or at least for your guidance, if there's no increases in the typical January 1 timeframe. As you think about what that could imply for the changing dynamics of the market as a whole, especially with news this morning about apparent changes to Part B coming, how do you think about positioning yourself and contracting with manufacturers, contracting with customers in a world where there continues to be a moving target on what that reference rate and what that pricing dynamic could be over time?
Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Well, Mike, thanks for that question. I think I would reiterate that, again, we have changed our assumption on branded price inflation to the mid-single digits. And I would reiterate my comments, if pricing inflation does go away then we expect that, that range could be $75 million to $90 million. I would also remind you that we have talked about over time, how we've continued to evolve our relationships and our agreements with manufacturers, as well as evolving our relationships and agreements with customers. And we believe that it's important for us to put the economics on each individual product that we service to our customers so that it reflects the services that we provide on those products for manufacturers to our customers. And so we continue to have strong dialogue with both manufacturers and customers. We continue to work with them and partner with them and try to understand the evolving dynamics. And we'll continue to evolve our relationships and our agreements such that we're being paid a fair value for the services that we perform on each of the product categories that we provide to our customers and for our manufacturers.
Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks a lot. I'll let others ask questions.
Operator: Next we'll go to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Good morning. John and Brian – John, I appreciated your comments at the beginning, but I want to really try to understand how to think about McKesson going forward. So, we talk about drug pricing, we talk about changes that are happening in D.C. I heard you talk about your Life Science business and maybe make incremental acquisitions there. As you think about the different businesses that you have today, for example, international that hasn't worked quite the way you anticipated when you bought Celesio, how do we think about McKesson over the next few years? Does it make sense to continue to invest in that business outside the U.S.? Are there larger incremental acquisition opportunities you see within Life Sciences? And then, as we think about, for example, your oncology business and this changing dynamic around pricing, are there other acquisitions that you need to make? Are there business model changes that need to be made? I know this is a big question, but I think if we just think about how McKesson is going to be positioned over the next few years, I think it'd be really helpful to hear your thoughts.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, thanks, Lisa, for the question there. And clearly that was a big question covering lots of different subjects. I think that if you look at McKesson historically, we've done I think a really good job of managing our portfolio of businesses. So first, as you pointed out, we're not afraid to buy and sell businesses and to react where we see the market opportunities emerging. Clearly, Brian was a big part of that in his previous role in corporate strategy and business development and will play a very important role in his new capacity. We think we are in the right businesses at the right time. You mentioned a couple of times our McKesson Life Sciences business and our continued increased exposure to the biopharma industry and these new product launches that are coming out. We believe there's not only an opportunity for us to make money in our core distribution businesses related to this innovation, but perhaps as important, or maybe more important, a lot of these biopharma companies are beginning to turn to McKesson and our Life Sciences business to provide them with incremental support that helps them get the product to market, improve the adherence and compliance to these products, help the patient get access to both the drug as well as expert advice and support, and also get the right payment structure set up so these patients can qualify with their payers and health plans to be covered for the use of these medications. So, we feel really good about where we are and we think we're positioned properly. When you think about changes to the pricing dynamic, I think Britt did a nice job of outlining for you how much risk McKesson might have related to price inflation. We've tried to bound that risk for investors so you have a sense for how meaningful or how little meaning it has to us at this point in our evolution. Years ago, we began to move our model away from a dependence on price inflation on the brand side to create value, and we think our new relationships continue to evolve nicely in that area. Clearly, there have been people talking about this whole idea of a list price reduction. We believe what we received from manufacturers represents a fair payment for the value that we deliver on an ongoing basis. So we believe very strongly we will continue to have a revenue-based relationship with biopharma, and that that relationship may be modified over time as necessary if we find that the prices change in a significant way. And then you mentioned our oncology exposure. We're really pleased with the growth we're seeing in our oncology business particularly, which is part of part of our Specialty Solutions business. And not only is the U.S. oncology business growing rapidly with a significant increase in the number of physicians and practices that are involved in U.S. oncology, but we're finding that the market in general finds our value proposition compelling and that solutions we bring are very differentiated in the market, and we are gaining significant momentum in oncology particularly. When you think about pricing risk in that market, clearly various reimbursement strategies have been used over decades in community oncology, and our community oncologists have very resiliently moved their business practice and model to reflect the value and the service they deliver to their patients. We don't believe the administration or anyone that's a payer for healthcare would like to see oncology services move away from the community setting. First of all, it won't be as convenient and as accessible for the patients in America. We don't think it'll improve quality, and it clearly will increase costs if these patients and physicians migrate to a more acute setting. So, albeit there may be changes in the way payment structures move, but we've had significant success even recently with the Oncology Care Model experiment that took place with Medicare to help us prove that we can deliver in a value-based way a more all-encompassing treatment process in a way that delivered the quality that was reflected and required in the Oncology Care Model. So it wasn't necessarily drug dependent. So, I think if we see some changes in the way that it's done, it's not clear that it'll affect oncology particularly. If it does, we think our practices and our partnerships are prepared to make that transition and work with the payers to be paid for the service.
Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Right. Thank you for all the comments. I appreciate it.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Yeah, welcome, Lisa.
Operator: And next we'll go to Eric Percher with Nephron Research.
Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC: Thank you. Thanks for all the detail on how your expectations have changed during the course of the first two quarters. Maybe one specific question, which is, as you laid out guidance for the year, did you expect that you might see the change benefit occur in fiscal year 2019?
Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Eric, thanks for that question. As we laid out, this was in connection with our original Change Healthcare transaction. It was not part of our original guidance. It was a negotiated agreement that happened during the second quarter. So we did not have that visibility as we laid out our original guidance, and it was not included in it.
Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC: Okay. And, Britt, could you rank order the items that have created headwinds as you entered the year? I want to make sure we have some sense of the magnitude for these moving items.
Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Yeah, thanks, Eric. I think, as we've called out here, certainly Europe has been a challenge for us. And I think we've laid out for you some of the dynamics that have created that challenge. We did lay out for you in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment that, before the year, we did have some customer losses, and those customer losses were anticipated. They were part of our guide. And from a year-over-year basis, they have created a headwind for us. Beyond that, we also laid out for you at the beginning of the year the Canadian reimbursement or Canadian generics price decline. We laid out for you what the gross headwind was there. We've made tremendous progress in mitigating that. And as I laid out, we believe we've mitigated over half of that and should start to see some of the benefits in the second half of the year. But we obviously have felt the impact on that the first half of the year. And then we've continued to make investments in our business, and I talked about some of the planned technology investments that are running through our Corporate segment. We believe that these are going to help us optimize our cost structure and our model going forward. And while there are headwinds this year from a cost perspective, these are the investments that are going to really give us the type of flexibility that we need as we go forward. And then the last thing that I would point out is I gave more description on it certainly this quarter are the costs related to opioids and the opioid-related expenses. And as I pointed out, we have experienced a significant amount of costs in our first half of the year and I also tried to provide you and what our estimate is going to be for the full year on these opioid-related expenses. So I don't know if that's a perfect rank order for you, but I wanted to really summarize for you the headwinds and how we've made progress against some of these headwinds, particularly in Canada.
Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. As I think about the performance during the quarter, U.S. pharma still beat despite brand pricing coming in below expectations. So is that just generics driving that? And then, what are your expectations on generics going forward? And what are you seeing there in terms of pricing trend and contribution to the P&L?
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thanks Brian for the question. I'll ask Britt to talk specifically about pricing trends as we see it both on, sort of, the buy side of generics as well as what we're seeing on the sell side. But speaking at a higher level related to our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, I would say that we are beginning to see a very nice stabilization of that business. We talked about customer churn coming into the year. We believe strongly in our value proposition, and we continue to create great relationships with our customers, and I think we see that business reaching a point of recovery with the potential outlying risks still associated with what happens from a pricing model perspective related to governmental changes or big pharma, biopharma policy changes. But maybe he could talk specifically about generics.
Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Sure, and what I would add to that, certainly we're seeing that stabilization in our U.S. Pharma business. We're also seeing really strong growth in our Specialty Solutions business, and John talked about that at the beginning of the call. So that's also embedded in there. In terms of how we think about pricing on the generic side, we've talked about this now for the last couple of quarters. On the sell side, we continue to see a very competitive yet stable environment. And on the buy side, we have seen that the rate of deflation has stabilized over the last several quarters. And in some product categories, we are seeing certain molecules and product categories firming up from a price perspective on the buy side. So the environment overall is in a more stable state than it has been in the last – or that has been 18 months ago. And we're certainly in a great position with our ClarusONE sourcing operation to continue to create great buying opportunities that we can provide good cost savings for our customers, as well as to really create that spread between the buy side and the sell side. So we're very confident in our ability to continue to source well through ClarusONE with a more stabilized environment, it really sets us up quite nicely.
Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for the questions. Hey, Britt, just to follow up on the back-half guidance specifically on the U.S. business, you're now expecting it to be down towards the bottom end of the range, down mid-single digits. It seems like obviously the declines in the back half would be worse obviously than the front half in order to get to that bottom of the range, and you did share some of the moving pieces and expectations. But could you maybe just break out for us again, of the expected decline in the back half, how much of it is from the anticipated opioid expense versus some of your changes and assumptions around things like branded pricing?
Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Within the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty segment, we do have certain costs related to the New York State Stewardship. So that will be in a part of our second half. And as we think about branded price inflation, we did give you an updated assumption around our guidance. So at the beginning of the year, we gave you mid-to high-single digit assumption for branded price inflation. We've now updated that to give more of a mid-single digit price inflation assumption. So those would be the two pieces that I would call out that have helped us to clarify for you our guidance assumption around closer to the lower end of our original range for U.S. Pharma.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's super helpful. And then, Britt, just one follow-up on the free cash flow. I think it's about, what, $70 million through the first two quarters? You're still sticking with the $3 billion for the year. Can you maybe just help us understand what bridges that gap? What are some of the timing issues at play as far as cash flow for the back half?
Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Sure. As I mentioned, you're right. It's $70 million of free cash flow in the first half of the year. Typically, we do see, because of seasonality, also because of just the timing of how certain customer payments happen during the year, that our fourth quarter is our strongest cash flow performance. And we expect that to continue again this year. So our first half of the year, as I mentioned, is slightly ahead of our own internal expectation, and we would continue to expect to generate $3 billion with a stronger second half performance, which is typical to prior years.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays.
Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Good morning, John and Britt. So just in relation to the UK pharmacy operations, the other publicly-traded company with large retail pharmacy operations in the UK seemed to be performing maybe a little bit better relative to your operations. I know there are some differences in revenue and profit mix between pharmacy versus front end when comparing these operations, but the two quick questions I have tied to this is, one, is there any strategic consideration on your part to perhaps diminish your exposure to pharmacy and focus more on front end in the UK? And then just quickly, number two on this, you mentioned in the press release you continue to have conversations with the UK government to discuss the value-added pharmacies, low-cost setting of care, et cetera. It's unclear just from the outside whether or not these types of lobby efforts have really helped to improve any reimbursements. I was just curious to just, generally, have there been any historical examples you can recall where some overly aggressive UK reimbursement cuts were perhaps reversed and there was some relief for pharmacy providers? Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, I think those are very important questions, and it's terrific to have Brian on the call given that his most recent responsibility was to run our European operations. And he, in particular, spent a lot of time in the UK both in terms of the operations of the UK, but also the political environment of the regulators. So Brian, why don't you take that question for us?
Brian S. Tyler - McKesson Corporation: Sure. Thanks, John. Thanks for the question. So I'd start with the first question of mix, and clearly the model of some of our competitors is quite different than the model we have in the UK. They tend to be much more front shop, health and beauty focused, might comprise as much as 60% to 65% of their overall mix where historically we've been a very healthcare, pharmacy-focused organization with roughly 85% to 90% of our mix from the Pharmaceutical segment itself. As we think about the front shop of that business, we continue to think about how we migrate to an overall healthcare value proposition, which puts retail pharmacy more in the front and center of the provision of care in the community. That could impact the mix of types of products we put in the front shop, and we're actively working through our merchandising strategies in that regard. The second thing you asked about, I believe, was just NHS policy overall, and we continue to be in very active dialogue with the regulators in the UK to champion our view. And we believe it's a view they actually share, that community pharmacy plays an important role in the overall population health of the communities that they serve. And so we continue to evolve our model in that direction. Clearly, the reimbursement landscape has been a challenging one for us, not just in the magnitude of the cuts we absorb, but in the difficulty of predicting when and how those cuts have hit us. I would say we are encouraged by the dialogue we're having, and you would see earlier this week, in fact NHS announced that they are going to keep the reimbursement rates for pharmacy flat for the coming year, where the original intent had been to impose some more decline. So, we view that as certainly incrementally positive news for us. I guess I'd just leave you with the thought that the team there is actively engaged on the policy arena, we're actively engaged with manufacturer partners as we reposition this business. And we continue to believe that it will play an important part in provision of health care in the UK.
Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Yeah, thanks, Brian. Next question, please.
Operator: Next we'll go to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: Hi. Good morning, guys. Given sort of where the stock is trading today, both on a sort of EBIT, EBITDA or P/E basis and where the free cash flow yield is, I guess, how are you thinking about kind of internal versus external investments? And I guess that – I know you've always been balanced in how you've done it, but obviously this is really unique time in terms of valuation for your business. And then secondarily, on the M&A side, you had done some things on the technology front. You've moved into a couple of higher growth areas also in Med-Surg, as you talked about at Life Sciences. How would you, kind of, characterize the pipeline for some of those growthier assets and whether you think you're getting paid for some of those businesses you're moving into, kind of getting back to the original question, and the multiple that the market's implying for you overall?
Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Ross, thanks for that question. I'll start and then John can certainly add to this. From a capital deployment perspective, I would just reiterate my comments that we did repurchase shares in the second quarter, $580 million. We believe that a balanced approach still is appropriate for us. You've seen us balance our capital deployment during the year. We've made investments such as MSD. We've also returned capital. So we've really been very balanced this year in terms of cash. We like businesses like MSD because they provide good growth opportunities for us. They're in businesses that we know and have operated for a long period of time. They also fit into our strategic growth initiatives, so where there's opportunities such as MSD, we're certainly going to take advantage of looking at those and evaluating those. We also believe, though, that our shares are attractively priced. And we talked about the share authorization that is still outstanding. Our management and board both feel that the shares are attractively priced, and we've continued to execute share repurchases as a result of that. And John, if you want to add to the M&A pipeline?
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, clearly, we are in the market. We're always active in the market evaluating transactions, and I think we make long-term bets on where we think the growth is going to be. To your point, some of the – in fact all of the recent acquisitions are performing very well for us and are producing returns that are significantly above our long-term cost to capital. We look at cash flow generation out of these businesses, and that's an important characteristic. And we can see our path to growing that cash flow. So, we're going to continue to use that combination. We're going to be disciplined. Clearly, the value of our own stock at these rates is, on a relative basis, improving in its attractiveness to us. And we're not blind to that, and we'll continue to be disciplined.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: Thank you. I'll look forward to that.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: You're welcome.
Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.: I think we have time for one more, operator. Alan?
Operator: Yes, sir. We'll take our last question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, hi. Good morning and thank you for all the details. John, both Gilead and Amgen announced their lower WAC for some existing product. Can you share with us your views on what are you seeing the implications are for the industry, and if you had conversations with the manufacturers on what that means to your existing contracts?
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, we have constant conversations with manufacturers, Ricky, as you know, and as we've said earlier on the call and on other calls, we are very focused on making sure we get a fair return for the value that we deliver to these manufacturers. We can't control what they do from a pricing perspective, but we certainly have a significant relationship that delivers tremendous value to the manufacturers and gives them access to our customers, most of which buy only from us, in a way that is really important. We continue to evaluate the economics of these changes from a price perspective, and we plan to maintain the economics that we've realized in the past on these products, certainly regardless of where the price point gets set. So that's our position, and we believe the manufacturers respect that and will continue to provide us with the right payment for the service that we continue to provide.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: I want to thank everybody on the call today for your time. McKesson continues to execute against our fiscal 2019 plan, and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us. I want to recognize the outstanding performance of our employees and their contributions to help our customers improve lives and deliver opportunities to make better health possible, and especially their commitment to helping their communities and each other during times of need. I'll now hand the call over to Craig for his review on upcoming events for the financial community. Craig?
Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.: Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events for the financial community. On Tuesday, November 13, we will present at the Credit Suisse Healthcare Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona. On Tuesday, November 27, we will present at the Evercore ISI HealthCONx, the conference in Boston. And in early January 2019, we will present at the J.P. Morgan HealthCare Conference in San Francisco. We will release third quarter earnings results in late January. Thank you and goodbye.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. We thank everyone again for their participation.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the McKesson Q1 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Craig Mercer. Please go ahead, sir.
Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.: Thank you. Thank you, Lynette. Good morning and welcome to the McKesson fiscal 2019 first quarter earnings call. I am joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO, and Britt Vitalone, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update and then Britt will review the financial results for the quarter. After Britt's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic Current and Annual Reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release and forward-looking statement slides for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, John and Britt will reference adjusted earnings, adjusted operating profit margin, free cash flow and items excluding foreign currency exchange effects. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information for investors with regard to the company's operating performance, and comparability of financial results period-over-period. Please refer to our press release announcing first quarter fiscal 2019 results and the supplemental slide presentation for further information and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. The supplemental presentation is useful when reviewing the fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018 results discussed today. Thank you, and here is John Hammergren.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thanks, Craig and thanks everyone for joining us on our call. Today, we reported a solid start to fiscal 2019. For the first quarter, we achieved total company revenues in excess of $52 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.90, consistent with our expectations. Given our recent update provided at our Investor Day in late June, I will focus my attention on a few topics and will let Britt go through the quarter financial results in greater detail. I'd like to take a moment to discuss the progress we've made against our multiyear strategic growth initiative. First, we continued to proactively execute against our priority growth areas namely the manufacturer value proposition, specialty pharmaceuticals and the role of retail pharmacy. In the past quarter, we closed the Medical Specialties Distributors or MSD acquisition. We accelerated the commercialization for a recently approved specialty prescription medicine with the reimbursement hub in specialty pharmacy support services representing one of the largest programs launched to-date. This is one example of a number of planned future commercializations with this partner and many others. We are executing against the business cases for other recent acquisitions such as CoverMyMeds, intraFUSION, Well.ca and RxCrossroads that also support our priority growth areas, which are beginning to contribute to our earnings growth. Second, we launched a program designed to optimize and drive an efficient operating structure that supports our prioritized growth areas. Britt will discuss these initiatives in more detail shortly. Next let me touch on our European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment. You'll recall in our year-end earnings call that I outlined a series of initiatives we took in Q2 of last year. These were in response to certain UK government actions. We have substantially achieved the results we outlined, generating savings and efficiencies from the plan we initiated in Q2 last year, rationalizing the store footprint and streamlining our back-office operations. On June 29, the government announced additional cuts to retail pharmacy reimbursement. Although helpful, the restructuring program we put in place in fiscal 2018 will not fully mitigate these new cuts. We will continue to respond to event-driven government actions through company-specific mitigation efforts. We also remain committed to continued policy and education discussions with the health ministry to ensure patients have ongoing access to care in low-cost and convenient settings. We have spoken previously about how retail pharmacy would help to ensure the sustainability of the health system in the UK and elsewhere as more services migrate from higher cost locations into the lower cost pharmacy setting. And the pharmacist plays a critical role in providing a range of personalized healthcare services to the patient. Now, I'd like to take a few moments to discuss our perspective on the recently-announced Health and Human Services blueprint request for information or RFI. The current administration is focused on fostering an affordable, accessible healthcare system that puts patients first, and we fully share this goal. We were also encouraged by the broad scope of the RFI, solving a myriad of healthcare issues is not a simple task and it requires a comprehensive evaluation of the challenges and opportunities. While policy decisions are being evaluated, McKesson continues to engage as a key stakeholder in educating policy makers, addressing issues that may impact patients, our industry and our business partners, and helping to drive the necessary change to support access, quality and affordability for a sustainable healthcare system. We remain confident in McKesson's path forward, the critical role of the services we provide to the healthcare industry today, and our ability to identify and apply solutions to address the most pressing challenges to the healthcare system globally. We can help drive the stated objectives of the administration. Today, we support patient access through affordable generic medication. We do this by leveraging our global scale and efficiency. We're proud to be a leader supporting clinical trials to help bring innovative specialty therapies to market through an increasingly optimized path and to partner with manufacturers and other stakeholders to help bring these new drugs to the patients who need them. We have extensive experience in supporting value-based care with tools, processes and expertise for both commercial and government payers and many of you will recall that through partnership with manufacturers almost 15 years ago, we were able to transform our business model by introducing inventory management agreements and distribution service agreements that significantly improved transparency across the supply chain. Many of you know that distribution service agreements compensate distributors for the fair value of the services provided. These agreements appropriately consider the requirement to maintain an efficient, secure and safe supply chain, high service levels, as well as substantial working capital investment made when taking title to inventory or collecting customer receivables, which together represents tens of billions of dollars on our balance sheet. To the extent changes are made to the current model, we are well-equipped to facilitate the change and to again partner with all stakeholders to ensure a smooth and effective transition. The value we deliver has been validated over the past 15 years through contract renewals, and expanded relationships both upstream and downstream in the supply chain. We remain confident we will continue to demonstrate the value of our highly-scaled and efficient distribution network, our services and capabilities, far into the future. McKesson has the patient at the center of how we think and we want to continue to be a leader in bringing real solutions to the debate that helps to lower cost while improving access and quality. Now to wrap up my comments, McKesson's fiscal first quarter results represent an in-line performance across our segments. We believe we are well-positioned to drive future growth with our scaled and efficient foundation, our clear focus on several priority growth areas and improving the efficiency of our operating structure, our leading Technology Solutions for our partners and of course our strong financial position. We are extremely well-positioned to execute our portfolio approach to capital deployment and to deliver value for our shareholders through a mixture of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Britt and will return to address your questions when he finishes. Britt?
Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Thanks, John. As John discussed earlier, our fiscal 2019 first quarter results were in-line with our expectations and we're reiterating our fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings outlook of $13 to $13.80 per diluted share. Please note that unless stated otherwise, the underlying assumptions that were detailed in our fourth quarter press release are being reiterated today. I'll start with the results for the first quarter. Turning to slide 6 of the presentation, first quarter adjusted EPS of $2.90 represents an increase of 18% year-over-year driven by a lower tax rate and share count, and growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, partially offset by previously discussed headwinds in our European and Canadian businesses, and a negative $0.05 foreign currency impact. Our first quarter adjusted earnings results excludes the following GAAP-only items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles of $0.74 per diluted share; acquisition-related expenses and adjustments of $0.22 per diluted share; LIFO inventory-related credit of $0.07 per diluted share; gains from antitrust legal settlements of $0.13 per diluted share; restructuring and asset impairment charges of $0.42 per diluted share; and other adjustment net charges of $2.41 per diluted share, largely comprising a non-cash goodwill impairment charge in our European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, primarily triggered by the recently-announced UK government reimbursement reductions as well as a change to our segment reporting structure. As detailed on slide 7, as a function of our segment reporting change in Q1 of FY 2019, our European business is no longer considered a single reporting unit. Following the change during the quarter, the segment was split into two distinct reporting units: Consumer Solutions and Pharmacy Solutions. We're conducting impairment testing of this new reporting unit level. We recorded a goodwill impairment charge during the quarter. Given that impairment testing is now being performed at a more discrete level for this segment, future negative events will trigger additional evaluation and we may be required to report impairment charges in the future. As John discussed, on June 29, the UK government announced additional reimbursement cuts to retail pharmacy. The cuts reduced our estimation of future cash flows resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. We responded to prior government action through our previously announced divestiture of closure of approximately 200 retail stores and, as a result of these recent actions, we are evaluating the effects these measures will have on our business. We will engage in discussions with the UK government to articulate the critical value pharmacy plays. We also recorded restructuring and other charges in the first quarter. These charges primarily relate to the ongoing execution of our multiyear strategic growth initiative. We're making solid progress to restructure and reshape our operating model and investment in strategic growth initiatives we have previously communicated. We're executing against the operating model framework we previously discussed. As one example, after a comprehensive review, we've expanded our strategic partnership with a business process outsource provider, which will allow us to continue our transformation of key supporting functions. This important step will allow us to swiftly move select functions out of our operations into our business process service provider, reducing costs and increasing productivity. We're making progress against our enterprise spend program. We've identified several cost categories that will leverage the scale of McKesson. We're confident these initiatives will generate meaningful and sustained savings. We expect to provide quantification of the operating model and cost-out targets next quarter. And we continue to expect to incur GAAP-only after-tax restructuring and other charges of approximately $150 million to $210 million in fiscal 2019. I'll remind you that these GAAP charges are not included in our adjusted earnings outlook. Now let's turn to the details of our consolidated first quarter adjusted earnings, which can be found on slide 8. Consolidated revenues for the first quarter increased 3% versus the prior period, primarily driven by market growth and acquisitions, partially offset by previously disclosed customer losses in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segments. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 2%. First quarter adjusted gross profit was up 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by market growth including the timing of branded pharmaceutical compensation in the prior-year and acquisitions, partially offset by customer losses. First quarter adjusted operating expenses increased 9% year-over-year primarily driven by acquisitions. Adjusted income from operations was $796 million for the year (sic) [quarter] (13:36), an increase of 1%. Interest expense of $61 million decreased 10% for the quarter driven primarily by the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates, partially offset by short-term borrowings. Now let's move to taxes. Our adjusted tax rate was 18.8% for the quarter, driven by our mix of business and a discrete tax benefit. We continue to assume an adjusted tax rate of approximately 21% to 23% for the year, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter. Additionally, income attributable to non-controlling interest was $58 million for the quarter, an increase of 4%. For fiscal 2019, we continue to expect income attributable to non-controlling interests to decline year-over-year. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations totaled $589 million with first quarter adjusted earnings of $2.90 per diluted share, up 18% compared to $2.46 in the prior year. Wrapping up our consolidated results, our first quarter diluted weighted average shares were 203 million, a decrease of 5% year-over-year. During the first quarter, we completed approximately $300 million of share repurchases, and we continue to expect diluted weighted average shares of approximately 200 million for the year. Next, I'll review our segment results which can be found on slides 9 to 12. As a reminder, effective in fiscal 2019, McKesson revised its segment reporting structure. We now report results in three main segments, which include U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, European Pharmaceutical Solutions and Medical-Surgical Solutions. All other businesses which primarily include McKesson Canada, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions or MRxTS and our equity investment in Change Healthcare are included in Other. We believe that this segment reporting provides increased transparency and visibility of the underlying operating performance of the businesses within McKesson. In addition, in the first and second quarter of fiscal 2018, contribution from Enterprise Information Solutions or EIS is included in Other. EIS contributed $17 million in adjusted operating profit for both the first and second quarters of fiscal 2018 for a total contribution of $34 million. We start first with U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions. Revenues were $41 billion for the quarter, up 2% driven by market growth partially offset by previously disclosed customer losses in branded to generic conversion. Segment-adjusted operating profit for the quarter was up 2% to $540 million, driven by market growth, the timing of branded pharmaceutical compensation in the prior year and growth in our Plasma and Biologics distribution business, which is partially offset by customer losses. The segment-adjusted operating margin rate was 132 basis points, an increase of 1 basis point as increased branded compensation was offset by our mix of business. We continue to see a growing mix in specialty pharmaceutical and we continue to benefit from the dollar contribution of these products, although it is dilutive to the margin rate. Moving now to European Pharmaceutical Solutions, revenues were $6.9 billion for the quarter, up 9%. Revenues benefited from $487 million in favorable currency rate movement. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 1% driven by market growth and acquisitions, largely offset by the previously disclosed increased competition in France, as well as a reduction in owned retail pharmacies in the UK following the closure and divestiture of approximately 200 stores. Segment-adjusted operating profit was down 12% to $74 million. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit was down 18% to $69 million driven by the impact of reduced reimbursement and the reclassification of certain prescriptions of over-the-counter products in our UK retail pharmacy business and increased competition in the French wholesale markets. The segment-adjusted operating margin rate was 107 basis points on a constant currency basis, a decrease of 25 basis points. As a result of the first quarter segment performance, as well as the incremental government cuts I mentioned earlier, we now expect segment-adjusted operating profit to be at the low end of the previously provided range of flat to mid-single digit growth. Moving to Medical-Surgical Solutions, revenues were $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 11% driven by market growth and one month of contribution from the MSD acquisition. Segment-adjusted operating profit for the quarter was flat at $125 million driven by market growth offset by timing of certain events. The segment-adjusted operating margin rate was 734 basis points, a decrease of 81 basis points, reflecting our mix of business. Finishing our business review with Other, revenues were $3 billion for the quarter, up 5%. Revenues benefited from $111 million in favorable currency rate movement. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 1% driven primarily by market growth across the businesses in the segment and acquisitions, largely offset by the impact of government actions in our McKesson Canada business and the prior-year sale of the EIS business. Other adjusted operating profit was down 8% to $213 million. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit was $204 million driven by the impact of previously-disclosed government initiatives on our Canadian business, the prior year's sale of the EIS business and a lower equity contribution from Change Healthcare, partially offset by growth in MRxTS. Adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $64 million for the quarter. Next, McKesson reported $95 million in adjusted corporate expense, a decrease of 16% in constant currency year-over-year primarily driven by timing and lower incentive compensation. We continue to anticipate that adjusted corporate expenses will decline in the low double-digit percentage in fiscal 2019. I'll now review our working capital metrics and cash flow, which can be found on slide 13. Our receivables days sales outstanding was flat at 26 days, days sales in inventory increased 1 day to 30 days and days payables outstanding decreased 1 day from the prior-year to 58 days. I would remind you that our working capital metrics and resulting cash flow may be impacted by timing including the day of the week that marks the close of a given quarter. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.2 billion. For the quarter, McKesson paid $826 million for acquisitions, repurchased approximately $300 million in common stock and paid $71 million in dividends. In the first quarter, McKesson used $1.1 billion of cash flow from operations, which was in line with expectations. As a reminder, our operating cash flow can vary significantly depending on timing. As we discussed on our Q4 conference call, in the fourth quarter, we received a customer payment that had been anticipated for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. After deducting $145 million for internal capital investments, McKesson had negative free cash flow of $1.2 billion, again in line with our expectations. For fiscal 2019, we continue to expect internal capital investments of between $600 million and $800 million, and free cash flow of approximately $3 billion. And yesterday, our board of directors approved an increase of $0.05 for our quarterly dividend or 15% to $0.39, which will be payable to shareholders in October. The increase to our dividend reflects our commitment to returning cash to our shareholders as part of a balanced approach to capital deployment. We also have a total of $4.8 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Before I wrap up, we continue to expect a positive foreign currency impact of up to $0.10 in fiscal 2019 and, in terms of fiscal 2019 earnings progression, we continue to expect that the second half will have a stronger relative EPS contribution similar to our fiscal 2018 results. In closing, I'm pleased with the progress being made on our operating model and cost-out initiatives, which will drive increased efficiency and productivity in our operations and allow us to capitalize on growth opportunities. We had a solid start to fiscal 2019 and we're reiterating our fiscal 2019 outlook with adjusted earnings per diluted share of $13 to $13.80. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask you to limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. Take your first caller, Glen Santangelo from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks and good morning. Thanks for taking my question. John, I just wanted to discuss two pretty high-level issues that I think are on everyone's mind and just sort of get your take. There's been a lot of rhetoric in the market around branded price inflation. You've seen some activity by a number of the manufacturers and so I'm kind of curious, have you had conversations regarding that and how you think that could ultimately impact the balance of your fiscal year? And then secondly, my follow-up would be around the administration's criticism around the current rebating system and the potential push to move from gross-to-net pricing and so both those issues in aggregate could have at least a meaningful near-term impact on your business and I'm sure there will be some type of mitigation efforts, but could you just give us your updated thinking on both those issues? Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thanks for the questions, Glen. Clearly, both of these issues are not new to the discussion. I think obviously the concerns or the comments around it have increased in frequency in the last several months, but several years ago, people began to talk about the widening spread, the use of rebates, the transparency or lack thereof of those tools and clearly, we've dealt with the changes in branded inflation for many years. I mentioned in my opening comments about the transition 15 years ago that the company I think helped lead to a more stabilized, more transparent relationship with the branded manufacturers in particular, focused on making sure that our model was not fully dependent on price inflation as one of the key drivers to our economics and over time, we've discussed with our shareholders that the view that we maintain some exposure to price increases in our P&Ls, but that exposure is significantly less than what it would have been going back in time and our relationship with manufacturers continues to be extremely productive. We have not only renewed all of those relationships time and time again over 15 years, but the conversations with the manufacturers have broadened in their context to include not just Distribution Solutions, but also go-to-market solutions as I highlighted also in my opening comments, helping people with product launches, helping them handle specialty products that require a lot of additional attention, and clearly helping them get better take-up on their new launches as well as better adherence to the prescriptions being written by physicians and reducing the friction, things like CoverMyMeds, those tools, allow patients to get access to these drugs faster, better economics and clearly without having to wait sometimes weeks to get authorization to take the meds. So, we've been evolving the model with branded manufacturers and specialty manufacturers, and I'm quite pleased and positive about my future outlook of our evolution of services focused on those manufacturers. As it relates to the impact of the year, I think Britt and I continue to evaluate how much value we expect in our guidance relative to branded price inflation and obviously we provided a range at the beginning of the year with an expectation of where that branded inflation would likely come in. Clearly, the month of July we believe is running at a rate that's less than what we would have normally expected, but I think several of these manufacturers have talked about delaying their price actions until later in the year, as they see how this transition or this model change progresses or doesn't progress. So, I think we're committed to continue to work with manufacturers and to make sure that we mitigate whatever negative impacts might occur as a result of their change. As it relates to the rebating that goes on, clearly, we are students of this industry and have some awareness of the to-ing and fro-ing of the manufacturing relationships with those that are negotiating formularies with them. We don't participate in the rebate structure that goes to the payers and the debate on gross-to-net is a very interesting discussion because as I've described I think in the past on conversations with you and others that although there obviously is a financially net price or average price that's realized by our manufacturing partners, that's not a single net. It's an aggregation of multiple nets and I don't see necessarily the ability or the desire of the industry to have a one-price for all type of a strategy. Now, we don't control what the manufacturers do and we don't have any input on how they set their prices, how much inflation they have or how much rebate they provide to the people in the channel, but what I would say is that if there is a significant reduction in the list price of these products where most of the driver of our economics is derived from, then we will be in discussions with manufacturers to make sure that we get the appropriate reimbursement for the fair value of the services we provide and our rate of return on a lower sell price would have to reflect the recoupment of that value so that we come out at a similar place to where we are today. We clearly agree with many others in the channel that cash payers of these drugs are being forced to pay list price and other abnormalities as they have risen over decades of these types of business models need to be addressed and Americans should get a fair price for the pharmaceuticals, but at the same time, a system like this that has been developed over decades can't be completely reengineered in a matter of weeks and months, and so I think it will take some time as we evolve to whatever model the manufacturers and the payers believe is appropriate going forward.
Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks for the thoughts.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Yeah.
Operator: We'll hear next from Michael Cherny from Bank of America.
Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good morning, everyone and thank you for taking the question. So staying along those same lines, John, it's been about a year since you outlined the initial attempts and discussions to work with your manufacturer partners on the contract shifts on how you contract with them. Clearly, there's a lot going on as Glen had asked regarding the overall market. Can you talk about how those discussions have continued to go and maybe just give some hypothetical examples or some big picture examples of what some of the evolution has been in any of the contracts that may have changed structure or changed how they're contracted between the two sides just to give us a sense of as we think about the go-forward what we could expect to see with those changing negotiations?
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, thank you for the question, Michael. The manufacturers obviously all of them are in different places in terms of how they price their products, the level of innovation that they're delivering to their marketplace, the productivity of their R&D activities, et cetera. And so I think, I can't speak with any specifics with any of them related to our relationship. What I can say is sort of a reinforcement of what I said to Glen and that is that the relationship between McKesson and our manufacturer partners has never been stronger, and when we've had conversations with them about their strategies related to price inflation or their strategies related to their list price of their product, never in those conversations do they indicate a desire to reduce the economics to McKesson because they recognize the tremendous value of the services we provide. So albeit, it may be a time and a process change that goes on between us and our partners related to how we're reimbursed and how these mechanisms might evolve over time, nowhere has anyone said to me, gee, we need to change this model because we believe the economics that we're paying for the value you deliver isn't fair. In fact, it's quite the opposite. They talk about not wanting to do what we do and the fact that we provide great utility value both to our buying customers as well as the manufacturers that we're both trying to serve. So, I think that I'm very confident that we will continue to make progress and as individual decisions are made by individual manufacturers related to their pricing strategy, we'll sit down and have individual discussions with them to make sure that we're properly reimbursed for the value of the service we provide and clearly, we always are trying to expand that discussion to include more than just our distribution services and go beyond into some of the other services that I described. And I'm probably the only remaining CEO in the distribution channel that actually went through the process 15 years ago and helped lead the process of providing better visibility to the manufacturers around the value of we do, providing better stability around our reimbursement, and in those leadership discussions, I think set a standard for how McKesson would move forward and I believe that standard still exists today.
Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Mike, maybe what I would add – this is Britt, I would add that over the last couple of years, the conversations have really become around focusing on the value for the services and expanding the services that we provide, whether that's special handling for certain new products that are being launched and as you've seen us over the last couple of years, you've seen less of a reliance on the variable component of compensation with manufacturers and really focusing on what are the services that we're providing and what is the value for those services and what additional services can we provide to those manufacturers, whether that's distribution services or those are other capabilities that we can help them with launching a product. So I think that's one of the ways that you've seen the conversations change over the last couple of years.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thanks Michael for the question and I want to also congratulate you by the way on the birth of your new daughter Reece (33:54). I was just told that recently, so congratulations on starting a new era.
Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much, John.
Operator: And at this time, we'll move to the next caller in the queue, Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much and good morning. John, last night, CMS proposed that we move to a new competitive acquisition program for Part B drugs. The way that it reads, it comments that they're looking to use private vendors to negotiate Part B drugs replacing ASP. Can you talk about it from two sides? One, the role that you think McKesson could play as a private vendor and two, any impact that any new pricing could have on your existing business? I'm thinking specifically U.S. oncology?
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, thanks for the question, Lisa. As you point out, U.S. oncology is the part of our business that has the greatest exposure to Part B reimbursement, and we are probably one of the largest purchasers of specialty drugs primarily focused on oncology. And we certainly have experienced over time our ability to work closely with the manufacturers to make sure that we've got the right economics on sourcing those products and making sure that the patients are getting access to the best available treatment regimes, and we believe that role is extremely important. In addition, I think that folks in the administration that I've chatted with when we've discussed this particular issue understand clearly that the best value for them as payers for cancer care continues to be in the community setting, and their view of our quality is as good or better than anyone else in the provider network. So I don't think there's a desire in specifics to focus on community-based physicians in any category let alone community-based oncologists in an attempt to destroy the economics of practicing in that venue. What they are focused on is making sure that the economics are maintained perhaps in a different way than just or just primarily on the drug's reimbursement characteristics. So we've had an open dialogue for some time. Like I said, there may be a transition here in terms of how oncologists are paid for the services they provide. And clearly as a very large buyer of these Part B drugs, we think we're in a good position to be a private vendor who negotiates the purchase price of the Part B drugs because we have the pull through characteristics attaching great formularies that utilize those drugs and provide market share to the manufacturers as a result of them providing us with the right economics and that's a role that we already play today with our buying activity. So albeit this could be another transition point for our business that may take some time to straighten out, but I think at least from my experience, having the best value from an economic perspective and the best quality aligned creates a position for you to be able to negotiate a model that makes sense for both the payers as well as for us and I might end my comment on the relative scale or meaningfulness of this as it relates to McKesson's overall financial characteristics. Clearly this is important to our physician partners and their viability is a top priority for us, and the ability to continue to treat patients in that setting is a top priority; however the economics that actually flow through to McKesson's P&L as a result of our relationship with the U.S. Oncology doctors in particular is relatively insignificant.
Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Yeah.
Operator: We'll hear next from David Larsen from Leerink.
David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC: Hi. Can you talk a little bit about the operating income growth rate in the Other division? It looks to me like it's actually down year-over-year. Is that correct, Britt maybe, and then how is Change Healthcare progressing? Thanks.
Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. Thanks for that question. As we pointed out during our Q4 earnings call, we did expect it to be impacted by the headwinds in our Canadian business. We outlined for you the changes in the generic reimbursement rate would have a gross headwind of $100 million to $125 million for the year, so that certainly is part of it. We are seeing really good growth in our MRxTS business as I mentioned in my remarks and then the third piece here is while we did see a decline year-over-year in Change Healthcare in the quarter, we still expect that Change Healthcare will meet the full year guide that we gave. We're seeing good operating performance. We're seeing good performance and progression against synergy targets. We're pleased with our performance, so I think the overriding impact here in the first quarter is really two-fold. One, the Canadian headwinds that I mentioned and then secondly, last year, we did have about $17 million of operating profit from EIS, which we have divested.
David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks. And then just any comments on generic deflation trends both on the buy and sell-side? How are those relative to your expectations and how did ClarusONE perform relative to expectations? Thanks.
Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Thanks for that question. We haven't seen any change from what we guided at our Investor Day. On the sell-side we still see a competitive but relatively stable market so no change in our view on the sell-side component of that. ClarusONE continues to perform quite well ahead of very strong first quarter. We're very pleased with the progress there and the partnership and the opportunities that are in front of us. From a buy perspective, the dynamics on the buy side, as we've talked about we've seen more of a stable environment from a deflation perspective, so this is running in-line with what our expectations were, really no supply disruptions that are of any material either and ClarusONE continues to drive great value from a buy side, so we're continuing to focus on building out ClarusONE and additional opportunities and taking the ability that we have on ClarusONE to create a spread for us that we can deliver great value to our customers on the sell-side.
David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Steven Valiquette from Barclays your line is open.
Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Thanks. Good morning, John and Britt. So just on staying on the topic of brand inflation, we keep getting asked by investors how to triangulate the collective commentary from drug distributors overall, then brand inflation doesn't matter that much anymore because of the fee-for-service agreements, but then the industry still has this large spike in profits in the March quarter each year that obviously seems pretty closely tied to the January annual brand price inflation cycle. I'm curious to hear your thoughts on that and maybe just the follow-up question tied to that would be, should we probably assume that McKesson is going to maintain a fairly wide EPS guidance range for most of fiscal 2019 because obviously your fiscal fourth quarter may be the most critical in relation to brand inflation. Thanks.
Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Thanks for that question. I would point to a couple things. First of all, you are right. Historically we have seen the manufacturers take the majority of their price increases in our fiscal fourth quarter. There is an impact from seasonality. We have our highest volumes in the fourth quarter, so the impact we would see from those would be higher just given that seasonality, and I would also point out that while we are more fixed than we have been historically, there is still a variable component to our compensation. So I would expect that that trend would continue. It is more of a seasonality component than anything else.
Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. As far as the guidance range then for the year?
Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: I think as we've talked about previously, we're not adjusting our guidance at this point. We have seen lower price inflation as John mentioned in the July month. If we see some changes to that that are significant, then certainly we will update you on that but we would expect to still be in the guidance range that we provided.
Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Moving next to Ross Muken from Evercore ISI.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: Good morning, guys. So, obviously, pretty disappointing developments in the UK business. I guess that business obviously has been trending lower and we felt we were getting to kind of the bottom of margins and then obviously the UK has a lot going on economically right now. I guess how are you thinking about sort of the pushes and pulls there in France and some of the other countries where there's sort of uncertainty around your ability to kind of adjust the cost structure as these kind of sea changes occur and the ability to kind of balance that versus kind of the long-term you see in those markets?
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, thanks for the question, Ross. Clearly, we are disappointed with the continued actions that the UK government has been pursuing, primarily focused on the retail pharmacy business there to your point. At some point there's going to be diminishing returns for this to be a source of their budget gap solved, and our dialogue with them is continuing. We don't want to be in a position where we find that the government puts us in a place where the entire retail industry is at risk and clearly, the more cuts that come down the line, the more likely that is to be a possibility, and perhaps a reality. So we are working to be more efficient in that market. We talked about the changes we made in our back-office in the fourth quarter. We continue to take cost-out, and the store closures have helped and if they push more stores into a lack of profitability, we may have to continue with that strategy. As it relates to France, we're obviously a very large provider of services in France. We've got great customer relationships. We've got a great strategy there. It's one of the markets where we have really delivered an omni-channel capability with online, in-store pick up et cetera, experiences for our partners to take to their patients and I think our presence in the market is really second to none. We have recently in the last 18 months or so experienced more significant price activity by our competitors probably in response to our superior value proposition and we've been forced to react to that in certain parts of the French market, but as we have in the UK and other markets in Europe, we'll continue to expand the value proposition and at the same time try to become more efficient and in particular in France, we did develop a national re-distribution center, similar to what we have in the U.S. that is performing at exceptional levels and allowing us to take out cost and capital in that market and deliver superior service and our scale frankly allows us to compete in a much superior way to others in that marketplace. So we're not going to lose market share there. We're going to match the price that our competitors put into the marketplace and maintain the volumes through our business and we hope that the pricing environment will stabilize over time. The larger backdrop of Europe is we're continuing to expand our services in many different areas, and begin to evolve our model so that we can provide services outside of retail pharmacy into specialty and hospital and home care like we've done in the UK, so we're still focused on expanding that business. Thanks, Ross.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: Thanks, John. And maybe just quickly, a lot of debate on biosimilars. Obviously the government is very focused on it. There's some new developments with new labs and a few others, I guess what's sort of your updated thoughts on how that market is kind of changing and the like and kind of your opportunity set there?
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, we obviously are very encouraged as well not only in the government's focus on the biosim opportunities and getting these products into the marketplace but the manufacturer partners that have come to us in particular are looking for McKesson to help them build a channel into the marketplace, in particular in biosims focused on oncology. As you know, Ross we have a world-leading clinical trial capability inside of our U.S. oncology network that provides value to all oncologists across the country. We help get products to the market faster and more efficiently and we have done that over and over again as it relates to branded product being launched. We think the biosimilar market provides a similar opportunity because of some of the characteristics of these products and a requirement to prove clinical equivalency to the original products and our doctors are very keen on helping make that happen and making sure the patients get the best product at the most value and that helps produce market share for the biosim manufacturers and improved profitability for their practices and a lower-cost for the patient.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: Excellent. Thanks, John.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Yeah.
Operator: Eric Percher from Nephron Research, please go ahead.
Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC: Thank you. A question on U.S. Pharma and Specialty. Last year, when you spoke to brand pharma compensation and the fact there was a tailwind in the quarter, I think there was an evening out over the course of the year. So when we look at this quarter I understand it sounds like that was a bit of a benefit to Q1. How does that progress over the next couple quarters and any other commentary on the cadence within that segment?
Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Thanks for that question, Eric. My comments really relate to that timing event that happened last year between Q1 and Q2. Our compensation or the value that we've earned from brand compensation in the first quarter of this year is in-line with what our expectations are and we wouldn't expect that there'd be any variability as we saw last year between first quarter and second quarter.
Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC: And last year, was that a headwind in Q1 that's been evened out over the course of the year, and I guess my question is should we expect that things get a little bit tougher in that comparison? And I'll add-on to that, the follow-on question which is among the other headwinds you expect this year, how many of those are reflected now in Q1 versus building over the course of the year?
Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: First of all, there was a headwind in Q1 of last year. It was really between the two quarters, so we wouldn't expect – and that was related to our continued evolvement of our agreements with manufacturers. As we think about the quarters this year, we wouldn't expect there to be any headwinds from types of evolvement of agreements like we had last year, so I think as you think about the first quarter of this year, we did have that timing event between Q1 and Q2 of last year. We also had customer losses that we talked about in our numbers in Q1 this year, but we still had some growth overall.
Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Moving next to Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.
Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. So just to clarify on Eric's question, Britt, when we think about the second half acceleration, in your prepared comment you said the second half acceleration is similar to last year. To give us some context, in 2018, what percent of second half acceleration can be attributed to the March quarter inflation?
Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Well, first of all, thanks for the question. I don't believe I used the word acceleration. I used the word relative contribution, and as we think about our second half, we would expect the same types of contribution in the second half would be the same this year as it was last year. What Eric asked about was a very specific event in Q1 of last year that was timing between Q1 and Q2, and that was related to our continued evolvement around our branded contracts become more fixed, so we would expect the dynamics of our quarters in the second half of the year to be very similar this year as they were last year.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: On a proportional basis.
Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Relative contribution basis.
Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then the second question, John. Many, many factors are suggesting moving the payment model to a fixed price system, which is not really benchmarked to a metric that's impacted by price. You operate in Europe where the model is a fixed fee based. So can you maybe kind of give us some color or some observation about what you see in Europe? Is it where you could potentially draw some similarities to how the markets here in the U.S. will evolve? Maybe what are the differences in terms of the economic value between the two regions?
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: While I appreciate the question, Ricky, I think it has several nuances in it. In Europe, there's not really a single model or a single reimbursement mechanism. I would say though in certain markets, the reimbursement is more dictated by the government and can sometimes be different based on brand versus generic and who the payers are for generic and whether they've outsourced the payments for generics and contracted for generic to other parties et cetera, et cetera, including we talked about the Canadian environment where the price of generic is set by government but it's a percentage of the branded price for the non-generic. So there's all kinds of different ways people have set up pricing regimens. We believe – it was my interpretation of the administration is that they're looking for the market to set prices and the conversation that Lisa had a few minutes ago where she talked about the government looking for private vendors to negotiate the price of drugs is another indication of the fact that the government does not want to play a role, in my view at least, the government doesn't want to play a role in price setting. This idea that Part B drugs are set by the government and not through some type of a process is something that they appear to be wanting to change. So I think, frankly, there is not going to be a coming together of the way drug reimbursement happens in Europe and the way it's going to happen in the U.S. It's more likely that market forces will shape the way U.S. drug prices are set. There'll be more transparency to consumers who are increasingly paying more and more of a portion of their drug spend through their benefit plan designs that companies like ours and others have put in place for their employees. And so, I frankly am encouraged by that move and I believe it allows McKesson to continue to work with the manufacturers and to negotiate reimbursement based on the fair value of what we deliver every day for them and in my view it can't be disconnected from the dollar value of the product that we are putting through our channel. Unlike a "shipper" of a product that would charge a fee for a box at a certain weight, McKesson's financial model is much more dynamic and much more significant and much more dependent on our ability to buy inventory, use our balance sheet, provide tremendous service levels to our customers, collect receivables, adjudicate prices, thousands of prices every day through our chargeback systems on behalf of the manufacturers and to manage contracts with GPOs and to do all kinds of things that go far beyond what a logistics provider is prepared to do. And because of our use of our balance sheet and the use of our financial systems and our knowledge of this industry built over 185 years, I think it's highly unlikely that we would go to some type of a fixed fee or per-unit fee model for McKesson. It would have to reflect the use of our financial tools and our role in the entire supply chain for pharmaceuticals in a fashion that's very similar today. So what's more likely to happen is the rate that we receive on the price of the product, however that price gets set, would be reflective of the value in dollars that we need to receive to be properly reimbursed for those services. So that's the strategy that we think works best for us. It's a strategy we think reflects the value of what we deliver every day and it's a strategy that we think the manufacturers are already used to having with us and that we think can be replicated going forward albeit there may be some transition timeframes that we'll have to work our way through.
Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Yes.
Operator: We'll move next to Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies.
Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. John, as I think about the UK business and the series of price cuts that you've seen, does McKesson have the ability to go back to the manufacturer – the drug manufacturers for price concessions to pass on some of the cuts? And then I know it's a different business but as we think about your relationship with the manufacturers here, I mean, how does that translate in terms of – I heard you talk about the value proposition, but if we can't pass price cuts in the UK, where is the confidence that we can pass on some of the price cuts or adjustments here in the U.S. in the future?
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thank you for the question. Clearly, the way the UK manages drug pricing both and service pricing for that matter is vastly different than the way it's managed here in the U.S. and the government's activities both on the manufacturer price as well as the retail service price is not established based on what we can at least determine as a market view. It's more of a policy view, and we continue to work with the payers to make sure the payer there, to make sure they understand the value we believe is being derived by using Retail Pharmacy. It's difficult for us to go back to the manufacturers when their economics are preset also by the same regulatory body with perhaps a different regime. So I think we're stuck in a little different place in the UK related to what might be actionable with the manufacturers. Now, clearly, on the services front, we can do a series of different things as a wholesaler to make sure that we're properly paid for the service we provide in those markets. I think as a retailer though because the government is involved in the retail dispensing economics for drugs, it makes it more of a challenge. I don't believe that anything that I'm hearing from the discussions with the administration here in the U.S. or my counterparts in the industry, I'm not hearing any discussion of people wanting to follow a model similar to what's being done in the UK as an example. And as I mentioned earlier, I think it's much more likely to take a market-based approach.
Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC: All right. Guys, thank you.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Yeah.
Operator: Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, thanks for the questions. John, I know there's been a lot asked on this call and a lot of focus on branded price increases but I just wanted to make sure if I try to summarize this, is this the right way to think about it? Is this the right message? So if there are in fact less branded price increases over time, as a wholesaler, as the pharmaceutical wholesaler, you need to just adjust the rate at which manufacturers pay you for the fair value that you bring, and ultimately you guys are confident that that will happen over time. Is that a fair summation of kind of the message around the potential change in branded increases?
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: I think it's a fair assessment of not only that dimension but also the question related to a massive reduction in the retail or list price of the product to a lesser price, whether that is defined as a gross-to-net discussion or a lower list price discussion, or a better value for cash payers, however that's discussed, I believe that we are going to be focused on recovering the economics related to our relationship with these individual manufacturers that allow us to continue to have the same dollar yield as we do today from the same transaction activity because the value we deliver frankly doesn't change based on their activity related to brand inflation or related to a gross-to-net-type of a discussion. So you're absolutely right. Your summary is accurate and we did a very similar transition frankly that was more difficult 15 years ago because the manufacturers at that point were not even really aware of how wholesalers are paid or how we made money and our activity in the channel and we improved our relationships with them significantly. We helped them improve their manufacturing cadence. We gave them better visibility to service levels and inventory levels and that activity really sets the stage for us to more rapidly move our model around to accomplish a net neutral economic impact to McKesson and that will be our objective.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: John, I think that makes a lot of sense. Just one quick follow-up if I could for Britt just around that same topic. As it relates to this year, not to get too tactical but obviously there's some changes going on with branded companies and their desire to take inflation. I know inflation is a factor in the guidance for this year. Is the type of changes you're seeing, is that captured, Britt, within the ranges that you guys have out there for this year?
Britt Vitalone - McKesson Corp.: Thanks for the question. Our first quarter was roughly in-line in terms of the experience that we saw with the manufacturers. July obviously has been quite a bit lower than we had anticipated and lower than what we've seen in previous years. We do anticipate at this point at least that we'll see the same type of behavior or activity by the manufacturers in the fourth quarter. To the extent that that doesn't happen it will have some impact on our numbers, and we would expect to still be in the guidance for that. So I think what we've seen in July is indicative of something different than what we've seen in the past but as we look at the whole year, we still maintain our guidance that we provided for branded price increases. But to the extent that the fourth quarter, our fiscal fourth quarter is – we experienced less branded price inflation. We'll have an impact but we would expect it to still be in the guidance.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks for that.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, I want to thank everybody for your participation on the call this morning. Like always, the questions are sound, they're appropriate, and they're based on your knowledge and experience with our company and I appreciate your objective in trying to get even more information and insight. We are off to a good start in fiscal 2019 and I'm excited about the opportunities that are ahead of us. I certainly want to recognize the outstanding performance of all of our employees and their contributions to help our customers improve lives and deliver opportunities to make better health possible. I'm now going to hand the call off to Craig for his review of upcoming events for the financial community. Craig?
Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.: Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events for the financial community. We will participate in the Morgan Stanley Global Conference in New York in September and we will release second quarter earnings results in late October. Thank you for your participation and have a good day.
Operator: That does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the McKesson Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Craig Mercer. Please go ahead sir.
Craig Mercer: Thank you, Nicole. Good morning and welcome to the McKesson’s fiscal 2018 fourth quarter earnings call. I am joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson’s Chairman and CEO and Britt Vitalone, McKesson’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update and then Britt will review the financial results for the quarter and full year. After Britt’s comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Before we begin, I will remind the listeners that during the course of this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company’s periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the forward-looking statements slides and text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Please note that on today’s call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, John and Britt will reference adjusted earnings, adjusted operating profit margin excluding non-controlling interests, free cash flow and items excluding foreign currency exchange effects. Please note, McKesson will no longer provide forward-looking GAAP earnings per diluted share guidance. The company is unable to provide this information without unreasonable efforts given the inherently uncertain factors impacting forward-looking GAAP results. Many of which are beyond the company’s control, such as LIFO inventory related adjustments, gains from antitrust litigations and certain impacts from federal tax reform. We filed the second 8-K with the SEC today, which includes supplemental historical statement financial information for fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018 results as well as quarterly information for fiscal 2018. This will allow you to compare our fiscal 2019 outlook to our historical results on the same segment basis. Finally, I would call to your attention the supplemental slide presentation that we will reference on today’s call which maybe found on the Investors page of our website at mckesson.com. We believe the earnings press release, supplemental slides and the supplemental historical segment information 8-K filing, which I will include non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for investors with regard to the company’s underlying operating performance and comparability of financial results period-over-period. Please refer to these materials which maybe found in the Investors section of our company website for further information and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thank you. And here is John Hammergren.
John Hammergren: Thanks, Craig and thanks everyone for joining us on our call. I am pleased to report our fourth quarter adjusted earnings of $12.62 representing a 1% growth year-over-year. These results were consistent with what we communicated a month ago which included a lower tax rate, stronger operational performance, and our $100 million contribution to create the new nonprofit foundation. And our fiscal 2019 outlook for adjusted earnings of $13 to $13.80 per diluted share represents low to high single-digit percentage growth year-over-year. This outlook reflects a competitive, but more stable market environment and effective capital allocation, while including the anticipated headwinds in our European and Canadian businesses. I would also remind you that our multiyear strategic growth initiative is not expected to materially impact our financial results in the coming year. We are in the preliminary phase of implementing the strategic growth initiatives and efforts are well underway across the organization. We will provide more details on our progress as well as our growth initiatives at our Investor Day, which is scheduled for the end of June. Turning back to our operating performance, I am pleased with our fourth quarter results, which were driven by solid execution across multiple businesses. And for the year, we were able to deliver results that were largely in line with our expectations outlined at the beginning of the year. Britt will cover our annual financial performance in greater detail, but let me provide some color on the year just concluded. During fiscal ‘18, we demonstrated our sourcing expertise and shared significant benefits with our partner, Walmart. We are excited about what we are able to deliver as well as the potential for expanded opportunities through this partnership. We bring new value to health systems customer relationships and renewed our extended contracts with all of our major independent buying groups in the past 18 months. We recorded the first full year of operations of Change Healthcare and scaled healthcare information technology business, which began integrating the combined businesses, realizing targeted cost synergies and preparing for the future initial public offering. And we made changes to our leadership team, including optimizing our management structure and combining our U.S. pharmaceutical and specialty health businesses. We made several important acquisitions during the fiscal year and we recently announced the acquisition of Medical Specialties Distributors, or MSD, which is intended to, among other things, expand our manufacturer value proposition in specialty capabilities. We successfully executed against each of these operational and organizational changes, which are aligned with our strategic growth initiatives and help positioned the company for the long-term. However, we did not anticipate the sizable additional government-driven headwinds in the UK and Canada. Let me take a moment to provide more details on these two topics specifically. First, the UK government initiative has not only impacted our current year performance, but will continue to have an impact going forward. These actions are on cost containment and medicine optimization among other things resulted in the designation of some prescription drugs as over-the-counter. While each year we modeled typical reimbursement cuts, we saw incremental cuts that drove a greater headwind than we had anticipated. As we entered the new fiscal year, we have assumed the mitigation efforts will fully offset anticipated government actions. We believe this assumption is appropriate given actions we announced in our second quarter earnings call to close or divest underperforming stores in the UK market. Switching now to Rexall, in many ways, the impact of the government initiatives in Canada are similar to what we saw in the UK. And while the reimbursement and minimum wage headwinds impact the entire Canadian supply chain, retail pharmacy operations are more impacted significantly. We do, however, had clear line of sight into generics reimbursement environment, for the next 5 years. And as I mentioned on our April call, we remain committed to retail in delivering high-quality care in a way that works for patients. In response to these government actions, our Canadian business has begun work on mitigating their impact, which includes advancing revenue diversification opportunities and additional reimbursed pharmacy services driving increased operational efficiencies, while ensuring consistent high-quality patient care delivery and taking on the leadership role and industry efficacy with governments on a sustainable reimbursement model. Next, we are pleased with the progress of our multiyear initiative to implement differential pricing for brand, generic, specialty, biosimilar and OTC drug classes in line with the services we provide to both our customers and manufacture partners in all of these five categories. We continue to address these important changes as we work through our contract renewal cycles. We remain confident in McKesson’s path forward, the critical role of the services we provide to the healthcare industry today and our ability to identify and apply solutions to address the most pressing challenges to healthcare systems globally. In summary, fiscal 2018 represented a year of stabilization, while providing a solid platform for our multiyear growth initiatives. I was encouraged by several developments during the year. First, despite the ever competitive environment we operate in, the revenue growth of our combined U.S. pharmaceutical and specialty health businesses was in line with our expectations, with higher growth being from the Specialty Health. We expect low to mid single-digit revenue growth for fiscal 2019 reflecting continued strong organic growth in this business. Additionally, RxCrossroads acquisition further expands our broad range of solutions throughout the lifecycle of the drug for biopharma companies. This transaction aligns squarely with our growth priorities supporting manufacturer programs and specialty solutions. Next, looking past the UK government actions we previously discussed, Europe’s businesses performed well. We began realizing synergies from prior acquisitions, which provide a foundation for our retail pharmacy growth initiative. We anticipate revenue to be flat to growing by mid single-digits driven by market growth in fiscal 2019. In Medical-Surgical, we delivered another year of solid growth and we are well positioned to support the growing alternate-site opportunity with the announced acquisition of MSD. This acquisition complements our alternate-site service platform and in combination with strong organic performance is expected to deliver revenue growth in the low double-digit range for fiscal 2019. McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions, or MRxTS, is a fundamental part of our strategy to help manufacturers and retail pharmacies to be successful. We are excited by innovative solutions like Express Coverage, a collaborative new solution, leveraging the expertise of McKesson’s Health Services and RelayHealth Pharmacy and CoverMyMeds, vast healthcare network and we believe we can do much more to benefit patients with the complementary capabilities we have built. And in Canada, while the government actions will create a near-term headwind, the business grew nicely in fiscal 2018. In addition, the acquisition of Well.ca provides patients with another channel to connect with us and forms part of the platform for future growth as we execute our retail pharmacy of the future initiative. Before I wrap up, our Board of Directors welcomed Brad Lerman as a new independent director in late April. Brad brings with him extensive compliance government relations and corporate strategy experience further strengthening the diverse backgrounds and perspectives we have on our board. I am extremely proud of this management team’s ability to adapt and maintain a constant focus on the patient in building our value proposition to help make our customers and suppliers more successful, which will continue to drive growth and long-term value creation for our shareholders. Last, I’d like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their dedication, leadership and consistent focus on putting patients at the center of everything we do. With that, I will turn the call over to Britt and will return to address your questions when he finishes. Britt?
Britt Vitalone: Thank you, John and good morning. Today, I will review our fiscal 2018 results, discuss our new segment reporting structure, provide a brief update on our multiyear strategic growth initiatives and provide details around our fiscal 2019 adjusted EPS guidance range of $13 to $13.80 per diluted share. As a reminder, we provide guidance on an annual basis due to both the seasonality in quarterly fluctuations inherent in some of our businesses. In this context, an annual view of our financial results can be more meaningful and provide more insight into key trends. Therefore, my comments today will focus primarily on annual results. Let me begin with a review of our results for fiscal 2018. Today, we reported fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS of $12.62 reflecting a lower tax rate and share count as well as solid operating results partially offset by the fourth quarter, $0.31 per diluted share contribution to create a nonprofit foundation to combat the opioid epidemic. Turning to Slide 6 of the presentation, our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings exclude the following GAAP-only item. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles of $2.60 per diluted share, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments of $1.20 per diluted share, LIFO inventory related credit of $0.31 per diluted share, restructuring charges of $2.82 per diluted share, including long-lived asset impairment charges and other adjustment net charges of $6.01 per diluted share comprising the non-cash goodwill impairment charges for our European and Rexall businesses and the early repayment of long-term debt that we disclosed last month, which was partially offset by benefits related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the sale of our Enterprise Information Solutions business in third quarter. In connection with the annual goodwill impairment testing that takes place in our fourth quarter, we recognized non-cash after-tax goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges, principally related to McKesson’s European and Rexall businesses, which were driven primarily by government actions in these markets. The European charges were driven by a weakening script growth outlook in our UK retail pharmacy business and a more competitive environment in our French wholesale distribution business. The Rexall charges relate primarily to the reason we implemented generics reimbursement reductions across Canada and minimum wage increases in multiple provinces. As it relates to our fiscal 2019, these two items, the reimbursement reductions and the minimum wage increases represented gross pre-tax headwind of between $100 million and $120 million. As John discussed, the Canadian team is working to mitigate the impact of these actions and we are confident that these initiatives will reduce the negative impact to our results in fiscal ‘19. Now, let’s turn to the details of our consolidated full year fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings, which can be found on Slide 8. Consolidated revenues for the full year increased 4% in constant currency versus the prior period primarily driven by market growth in acquisitions partly offset by the contribution of the majority of our technology solutions businesses to Change Healthcare in late fiscal ‘17 and the transition of Rite-Aid stores in the second half of fiscal ‘18. Full year adjusted gross profit was down 2% in constant currency year-over-year, primarily driven by the Change Healthcare transactions and the year-over-year effect of increased price competition in our independent pharmacy business in fiscal 2017, which we fully lap during fiscal 2018. These drivers were partially offset by organic growth, including contribution from our joint sourcing entity, ClarusONE and contributions from acquisitions closed in fiscal 2017 and 2018. Full year adjusted operating expenses increased 3% on a constant currency basis driven by acquisitions partially offset by the Change Healthcare transaction and ongoing cost management efforts. Adjusted income from operations was $3.9 billion for the year, a decrease of 4% in constant currency. Interest expense of $283 million decreased 8% in constant currency for the year driven primarily by the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates and net long-term debt repayments, which is partially offset by short-term borrowings. Now, moving to taxes, our adjusted tax rate was 19.6% for the year driven by our mix of business, a lower U.S. tax rate from recently enacted federal tax reform, the beneficial impact of the onshoring of our technology intellectual property in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and discrete tax benefits. Additionally, income attributable to non-controlling interest was $230 million for the year, an increase of 173% in constant currency primarily driven by fee income from Clarus. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations totaled $2.6 billion for the year, with full year adjusted EPS at $12.62 per diluted share, up 1% compared to $12.54 in the prior year. Wrapping up our consolidated results, during the fourth quarter, we completed $750 million of share repurchases bringing our total share repurchases for the fiscal year to approximately $1.7 billion. As a result, share repurchase activity late in fiscal 2017 and in fiscal 2018 our full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 6% year-over-year to $209 million. Next, I will review our segment results, which can be found on Slide 9 and 10. Starting with our Distribution Solutions segment, revenues were $208.1 billion for the year. Revenues benefited from $1.6 billion in favorable currency rate movement. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 5% year-over-year. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 6% driven by market growth in acquisitions partially offset by brand to generic conversions, lower revenues due to the transition of Rite-Aid stores and 2 less sale days in our U.S. pharmaceutical business. International pharmaceutical distribution services revenues were $27.3 billion for the year. Revenues benefited from $1.3 billion in favorable currency rate movement. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 5% driven by acquisitions and market growth. And finally, Medical-Surgical revenues increased 6% for the year driven by market growth, including a stronger than anticipated flu season. Segment adjusted gross profit was up 12% on a constant current basis driven by acquisitions in organic growth across multiple business units, including strategic sourcing benefits from ClarusONE. These gains were partially offset by the year-over-year lapping effects of increased price competition and our independent pharmacy business in fiscal 2017 and the impact of reduced reimbursement in our UK retail pharmacy business. Segment adjusted operating expenses increased 14% on a constant currency basis. This increase was driven by acquisitions in the midst of retail and technology businesses partially offset by ongoing cost management efforts. Full year segment adjusted operating profit increased 8% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis to $4.1 billion driven by the same factors as previously discussed. The full year segment adjusted operating margin rate was 196 basis points, an increase of 3 basis points. Turning to our Technology Solutions segment, revenues for the year of $240 million reflects the contribution in the first half of the year from the now-divested Enterprise Information Solutions business, which also contributed $32 million to adjusted operating profit. Adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $272 million for the year, which was in line with our expectations. Next, McKesson reported $527 million in full year adjusted corporate expenses, an increase of 30% year-over-year primarily driven by the previously discussed fourth quarter $100 million contribution to create a nonprofit foundation. I will now review our working capital metrics and cash flow which could be found on Slide 11. For receivables, day sales outstanding decreased 2 days from the prior year to 25 days. Day sales and inventory was flat at 30 days and days payables outstanding decreased 1 day from the prior year to 60 days. I would remind you that our working capital metrics and resulting cash flow maybe impacted by timing including the day of the week that marks the close of a given quarter. These working capital metrics, along with our continued focus on cash generation, results in $4.3 billion in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2018 above our original guidance. In addition to our outstanding execution, a portion of the gains we made in fiscal ‘18 were related to timing. Approximately $500 million of the operating cash flow performance was driven favorably by the fiscal year ending on a Good Friday and the early receipt of a customer payment that was anticipated to be received in fiscal 2019. Outside of year end timing impact and the transition of approximately 1,900 Rite-Aid stores late in the fiscal year, we had solid focus and execution on cash generation. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.7 billion. For the year, McKesson repaid approximately $765 million in net long-term debt and $580 million on internal capital investments, a $2.9 billion for acquisitions repurchased approximately $1.7 billion in common stock and paid $262 million in dividends. And yesterday, our Board of Directors approved an increase of $4 billion to our existing share repurchase authorization. We now have a total of $5.1 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Now, let me take a moment to discuss our new segment reporting structure effective in fiscal 2019. As previously disclosed we began an evaluation of our management and reporting structure. As a result of this review, we will now report our financial results in three reportable segments: U.S. pharmaceutical and specialty solutions, which included our now joint U.S. pharmaceutical and McKesson Specialty Health businesses, European pharmaceutical solutions and Medical-Surgical solutions. All remaining operating segments and business activities are included in other primarily comprised of our McKesson Canada business, our MRxTS business and the equity method investment in Change Healthcare. We believe this new segment reporting will provide increased transparency and visibility for the underlying operating performance of the businesses within McKesson. I encourage you to review the second 8-K that we filed today provides historical supplemental information on the basis of this new reporting segment structure and will help you frame our 2019 outlook. Before I get to our fiscal 2019 outlook, I’d like to briefly update you on the multiyear strategic initiatives we announced in late April. As we have discussed, we are focused on driving growth by improving the alignment of our operations to support the key growth pillars that we have discussed with you in April. Specific areas of operational focus over this multiyear period through delivering efficiency, driving cost out functional areas such as informational technology, finance and human resources. Additionally, we are focused on investing and developing world class data and analytics platforms and building solutions to become more efficient and agile. These efforts are expected to yield increased productivity and operational flexibility. I am sure that our operations have the right operating and financial rigor and generate meaningful cost savings for the organization and fiscal 2019 will help fund the growth pillars that we have outlined. As part of preliminary phase of this initiative, we continue to expect to incur GAAP-only after-tax restructuring and other charges of approximately targeted $150 million to $210 million in fiscal 2019. I will remind you that these GAAP charges are not included in our adjusted earnings outlook. Now, let me provide context to our fiscal 2019 outlook. As described in our press release issued today, McKesson will no longer provide forward-looking GAAP guidance. We will continue to provide transparency around our GAAP results, including the reconciliation of our adjusted earnings to GAAP results. We expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $13 to 13.80. This guidance reflects low to high single-digit growth in adjusted earnings year-over-year. As a reminder, our fiscal ‘19 adjusted earnings outlook excludes the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments; LIFO inventory-related charges or credits, gains from antitrust legal settlement, restructuring charges and other adjustments, which may include gains or losses from divestitures, asset impairments or adjustments to claim and litigation reserves. I refer you to the list of assumptions included in the press release we issued today, which are also on Slides 14, 15 and 16 rather than go through each assumptions, said walk you through the key items in our outlook. On a consolidated basis, we expect revenue growth in the mid single-digits year-over-year driven by market growth and previously closed our announced acquisitions. Adjusted income from operations anticipated to be down slightly to up mid single-digits. For the U.S. pharmaceutical and specialty solutions segment, we expect low to mid single-digit revenue growth year-over-year reflecting market growth and acquisitions partially offset by Rite-Aid and adjusted operating profit is anticipated to be flat to down mid single-digits driven primarily by customer losses partially offset by organic growth and accretion from acquisitions. In the U.S. market, we anticipate branded pharmaceutical percentage price increases in the mid to high single-digits consistent with fiscal 2018. As I noted on our third quarter earnings call, while the overall brand inflation rate is important, it’s less important to McKesson as we have evolved our branded compensation arrangements to reduce the variability associated with brand inflation. And for the generic environment, all of our customers will continue to benefit from our strategic sourcing through ClarusONE. And on the sell side, we see the market environment as competitive, but stable. Last, in terms of new oral generic pharmaceutical launches in the U.S., the profit contribution is expected to be nominal. For the European pharmaceutical solutions segment, we expect flat to mid single-digit revenue growth year-over-year reflecting market growth and flat to mid single-digit adjusted operating profit growth, which is anticipated to be driven by organic growth partially offset by the lapping effect of the UK government initiatives I mentioned earlier. This outlook assumes typical reimbursement cuts in the UK market. As we discussed on our second quarter earnings call, we initiated a cost savings program in response to the UK government announcement of additional reimbursement cuts, which were incremental to their more typical annual reimbursement reductions. This initiative included identifying and implementing actions to offset the fiscal 2019 impact of reimbursement cuts, which included approximately 200 store closures or divestitures. The program is substantially completed in fiscal 2018 and we anticipate realizing savings of fiscal 2019 as a result of the program. For Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, we expect low double-digit revenue growth year-over-year, reflecting the anticipated close of the MSD acquisition and market growth and mid to high single-digit adjusted operating profit growth which is anticipated to be driven by the ongoing shift of care to lower cost alternative-site care we serve and modest accretion from MSD, which we expect to close in the first half of fiscal 2019. For other, we expect low single-digit revenue growth year-over-year reflecting market growth and flat adjusted operating profit, which is anticipated to be primarily driven by growth in our MRxTS business offset by the negative impact of Canadian government initiatives, which I mentioned earlier. For Change Healthcare, we anticipate the equity contribution to grow in the low to mid single-digits primarily reflecting progress against the cost synergy target partially offset by anticipated higher interest expense. As a reminder, the equity contribution from Change Healthcare maybe impacted by the tax rates applicable to the underlying businesses, which includes a mix of pass-through and taxable income. Corporate expenses are expected to decline year-over-year primarily driven by the fiscal ‘18 contribution to create a nonprofit foundation partially offset by incremental technology investments planned in fiscal 2019. We expect both interest expense and NCI to decline year-over-year and the guidance range assumes an adjusted tax rate of approximately 21% to 23%, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter. This adjusted tax rate reflects our mix of businesses and the benefit of a lower federal tax rate partially offset by a changed accounting rules no longer allows the company to reduce its tax rate for the amortization benefit related to the intercompany sale software with Technology Solutions segment in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect weighted average diluted shares for fiscal 2019 to be approximately $200 million, which reflects the impact of share repurchase activity completed in fiscal 2018 and the benefit of share repurchases anticipated in fiscal 2019. In addition, we expect the positive foreign currency impact of up to $0.10 in fiscal 2019. In terms of fiscal ‘19 earnings progression, we expect the first half quarterly EPS progression to be similar to last year and that the second half will have a stronger relative EPS constitution. Turning to cash flow, beginning in fiscal 2019, we plan to provide guidance on free cash flow as we believe this non-GAAP measure provides a more useful metric as the company’s ability to generate cash. We defined free cash flow as cash flow from operations, less property acquisitions and capitalized software expenditures. We expect free cash flow to be approximately $3 billion in fiscal 2019, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenditures estimated to be between $600 million and $800 million. In closing, I am pleased to reiterate our fiscal ‘19 adjusted EPS outlook of $13 to $13.80 and introduced our new segment reporting structure, which we believe will provide you with more insight into our performance. And I am confident that the efforts underway to transform our operating model will drive increased efficiency and allow us to capitalize on growth opportunities. With that, I will turn the call back over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Let’s turn the call over to our operator.
Operator: Thank you so much. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Steven Valiquette with Barclays.
Steven Valiquette: Hey, thanks. Good morning, John and Britt. Thanks for all the extra segment details. I guess just drilling in a little bit deeper on the U.S. pharma segment with the operating profits expected to be flat to down a little bit in fiscal ‘19 you mentioned Rite-Aid as the key factor, but I am curious just two other quick questions around that. First, are there any material customer contract renewals also baked into that assumption and also is there any quantification of the acquisition contribution into that U.S. pharma segment EBIT expectation as well? Thanks.
John Hammergren: Thanks for the questions, Steven. This is John. Our assumption around customer contract renewals is pretty consistent with what we have experienced in the past. So as you know we typically renew our customer contracts when they come up and we do a pretty good job of making sure that value is delivered to our customers and then we continue to drive efficiency in our organization. So I think the time that we have really come up on the negative end of customer contract renewals has been related primarily to consolidations where sometimes we can’t predict which way a customer might land or certainly the acquiring company might weigh more heavily in those decisions. So I think our forecast clearly would expect us to continue to renew our contracts and they have the normal kind of cadence of those renewals. Britt, perhaps you can help with the second question?
Britt Vitalone: Yes, thanks for that. As it relates to M&A and the impact that we expected to have, as you know last year, we completed a number of acquisitions and in the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of RxCrossroads and I would remind you that we provided you an accretion estimate by the end of year three of about $0.25, but we completed a number of acquisitions that we are excited about, we think that they are going to add to the overall excitement and RxCrossroads is a good example of that.
Steven Valiquette: Sorry, it’s future acquisitions though is there any assumption for that in there or is that not in there?
Britt Vitalone: No, we have outlined for you the acquisition of MSD which we announced in our April call.
John Hammergren: Which is in the medical segment.
Steven Valiquette: Okay, got it. Okay, thanks.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa Gill: Thanks very much. John, I just want to go back to your comment though about renewals on existing customers, can you just remind us are contracts generally renewed exactly at the date that they expire or is the anticipation that perhaps you give up some pricing prior to that expiration date, because that’s an important relationship?
John Hammergren: Well, that’s a good question, Lisa. I would say, our history is that we maintain these relationships for very long times. The contracts might have duration of let’s say an average 3 years, but many of their relationships go decades and our typical pattern is to renew those relationships or extend those contracts in a form that’s very similar to what it’s been in the past. So, I’d say most of them don’t renew exactly on the expiration date. They usually sort of a rolling process of renewals before they expire to the standard to move forward with the relationships. So, your point is accurate. I can’t give you specific time, but these things would renew usually in advance of their expiration date.
Lisa Gill: And so I think what we just want to understand is that, that’s included in the guidance you gave, your anticipation is that you are going to renew the relationships that you have and that there could be some element of renewed pricing in the guidance that was given today?
John Hammergren: Absolutely. I mean, our guidance fully reflects what we anticipate will happen in fiscal ‘19 and reflects the contracts that are expiring in our anticipation of not only the renewal, but also likely financial impact of those renewals. So, that’s fully included. Now, clearly, we could be surprised and we don’t anticipate that we are going to lose our customer base and that our assumptions are built into this forecast.
Lisa Gill: And then as a follow-up to that, when we think about incremental opportunities, we should think about those renewals and I think about ClarusONE, what are some of the incremental things you can add to that platform, over-the-counter products is one thing that comes to mind for me. Is over-the-counter an opportunity, do you think of other things that you can put into your purchasing procurement as you think about those renewals with some of these larger contracts that you have?
John Hammergren: Well, Britt helped us build ClarusONE, I will let him address ClarusONE specifically, but obviously one of the things we are trying to do also is to get more and more of our customers to buy all of their generics from us and that compliance to our generic purchasing requirements continues to expand. So that’s part of the value that we derived both for our customers and for ourselves is getting more and more people into sourcing all of their generics from McKesson. As it relates to going beyond just generic purchases, Britt, maybe you can talk about future opportunities.
Britt Vitalone: Sure. Thanks for that question. With ClarusONE, we are certainly working with Walmart, but also our other customers to understand where we have opportunities to leverage our scale collectively with our customer base. OTC is certainly an opportunity for us and it’s one that we have discussed among other, many other opportunities at Walmart. So clearly looking at how we can help our customers and how we can leverage scale across ClarusONE and our customers to deliver across multiple categories is certainly something that we are talking about and considering as we move ClarusONE forward.
Lisa Gill: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Glen Santangelo with Deutsche Bank.
Glen Santangelo: Yes, thanks and good morning. John, it’s pretty clear that your pharmaceutical and specialty solutions business is going through a pretty significant evolution here with respect to specialty and the generic tailwinds seemingly are largely in the rearview mirror. In your prepared remarks, you talked about your differential pricing strategy for brand and specialty and generics, could you talk about maybe how some of those contract renewals have gone with respect to this new pricing strategy? Is that having a near-term dilutive impact on your margins or how should we think about that?
John Hammergren: Well, thanks for the question. I think as we have indicated and we began this process several years ago and as our contracts have renewed we have been very successful in working with our customers to provide specific pricing to the five categories of product purchases that I described. I think we have been quite successful and I would anticipate we will complete this process throughout this fiscal year and perhaps slightly into next fiscal year. I think what you are seeing in our business is a continued focus on driving value for our customers on many dimensions. Certainly, the specialty business is focused on the clinics, the U.S. oncology business, the things we do outside of the hospital continues to perform very well and grow rapidly, but there is also a growing portion specialty that’s inside of our standard U.S. pharmaceutical business. That mix change continues to be reflected in some margin pressure in our business and that’s what we have been attempting to alleviate when we renegotiated these contracts, having said that, there is incremental profit being derived from the sale of the specialty items even in these hospital settings. So I think the margin expansion opportunity that we have achieved in the past has been partially driven by the move to generics, it’s certainly been driven by the efficiency in our operations and now it’s going to increasingly be driven by our ability to become more efficient in our operation to offset a little bit by the mix change that we are seeing.
Britt Vitalone: I would add to that, John, that, clearly the focus is not just on the customers as we think about the growth of specialty we work very collaboratively across our customers and our manufacturing partners to find the value not only for our customers, but our manufacturer partners if you think about our specialty business which we have invested in, we have a range of services and capabilities that we can help provide our manufacturing partners as well. So our focus here is obviously to get the right compensation for all five categories, but we do that looking across collaboratively on manufacturing partners and our customers.
Glen Santangelo: Okay. Maybe just one quick follow-up and I apologize if I missed it on Change Healthcare, have you given us an update on the timing for the IPO?
John Hammergren: We haven’t been very specific on the timing, I think because we are continuing to evaluate when the best time is for that company to go public. It’s going to be dependent on our view of the synergy and the flow of the synergies that we outlined at the beginning of the business case, obviously, the revenue projections for the business and then clearly market conditions. So I think stay tuned as we get closer to picking a date, we will certainly advise you, but the plan remains as it has been to take the company to an LDO – or excuse me an IPO process.
Glen Santangelo: Thanks for the comments.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ross Muken from Evercore ISI.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi, this is Elizabeth Anderson in for Ross. Just sort of following up on Glen’s question, can you touch more broadly about the opportunity that you see in specialty today versus in the past, I know that there has obviously been some changes and commentary from HHS about shift of Part D. The Part D is sort of, how would that impact U.S. oncology or sort of your thoughts more generally on the topic would be very helpful?
John Hammergren: Well, certainly, the exposure we have in specialty continues to grow and we have put the company in a position where we think we can benefit through this new growth cycle. A lot of the innovation that’s coming from the pharmaceutical industry is coming as you mentioned in the specialty categories in particular in oncology. And as Britt was talking about a few minutes ago, some of the acquisitions we have done on the internal development we have done has been to provide incremental services to pharma manufacturers, particularly those that are focused on specialty launches and what can we do to support them. So we have an increasing revenue and profit stream coming from the manufacturer services part of our business both in medical and in pharmaceutical products and we continue to increase the exposure the company has and the opportunity we have to support those launches with the manufacturers. As it relates specifically to reimbursement, clearly, we are following that very closely. We do, our customers in particular, had some exposure to what type of reimbursement models the government might put in place, but I think clearly everyone would agree that service provided by community-based physicians provides not only better access and convenience at people, quality, but it also does it at a much lower cost. And so I think that certainly ourselves and other people that are involved in the channel would clearly recognize and the payers as well recognize that community-based services of these specialty products is the place that people should go. So I am pleased with our footprint and I think we will continue to grow nicely as these products come to market.
Elizabeth Anderson: Alright, that was helpful. Thank you. And then as a follow-up outside of specialty, what are your, sort of organic and inorganic priorities given your general shift towards higher gross margin business segment?
John Hammergren: Well, you can see some of it played out in the acquisitions that we are doing. And as we have talked about the acquisitions in last year and the years prior, we are obviously trying to increase our exposure to specialty in the manufacturer services which we have talked about. We would see us continuing to invest in our Medical-Surgical business, MSD is a good example of that and you have seen us continue to expand our ability to attract customers through innovation from a technology perspective. So I think you will see us continue to invest across some very good dimensions and we obviously have done some acquisitions in our U.S. pharmaceutical business as well that have performed very well. So, I think it remains opportunities for us to continue to expand our service for our customers.
Elizabeth Anderson: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut: Hi, good morning. John, as we think about these contract renegotiations and you have been talking about the services that you can offer to manufacturers, so how are you thinking about the ability to leverage some of these wraparound services and capabilities that you have and how that could help you, so as we think about the contract renegotiations?
John Hammergren: Well, you mentioned manufacturers in the middle of it, so we do have obviously contracts with providers.
Brian Tanquilut: I am sorry, I mean contract with the providers, but do the services that you provide the manufacturers and the wraparound, I mean, does that help you at all as you look at negotiating your contracts with the clients – with the providers?
John Hammergren: Well, I certainly think on many dimensions it will. In some cases, we have exclusive access to products that we might be shipping to do our specialty pharmacy businesses. Clearly, in the medical side of our business, we have special arrangements with lab supplies and others, so that our customers would have a difficult time finding the complete set of solutions from another source and so that would be part of it. I would say that the services we provide to our customers in our biggest business, our U.S. pharmaceutical business continues to be driven by our ability to innovate and help them deliver value beyond just the cost of goods that we provide. So you have seen this grow our business significantly, for example, with Health Marts over a decade now, over close to 5,000 stores and that’s driven largely not just by the price of our generics as an example but by the value we can deliver to the store, improving their profitability, improving their access to patients and putting them into these narrow networks and making sure that they are getting a consistent supply of customers and new customers and growing the way the relationship can become over time through a more fulsome set of capabilities and we are doing the same thing on many dimensions with our largest customers. And that’s why our renewal rate with our customer basis has been so successful. We mentioned in our prepared comments that we have renewed or continued or expanded or pushed out our date of expiration on these large independent GPO customers. So, almost all of those now have been renewed and have been expanded. That happens because of the total value that we are able to deliver to our customers. I mean, if you back and look at our customer retention across even our largest most sophisticated customers, we largely retain those customers unless there is something disruptive that happens in the marketplace. So I think we are quite confident that we will continue to build these relationships and continue to expand in it. That doesn’t mean that we don’t have price pressure in it. We don’t have to renegotiate and get back some of the efficiencies we have derived over years in serving the customer, which will provide obviously some downward pressure on our margins, which is reflected in our guidance. I think we remain pretty committed to adding value to our relationships and expanding them.
Brian Tanquilut: Now, appreciate it, John. Just my follow-up since you have touched on generics, as we think about your guidance for 2019 and then you talked earlier about the stability or 2018 was the stabilization year, what are you expecting in terms of generic pricing, what are you baking into the guidance at this point? Thanks.
John Hammergren: Well, we don’t talk specifically about generic pricing. I would say the way we think about generics, that was when we want to be the best buyer of generics in the marketplace and we believe we are today or currently equal to everyone that’s sourcing generics, our scale is quite significant. ClarusONE has performed exceptionally well and our customers benefit from the scale that we provide and certainly the manufacturers do from the share we are able to deliver consistently to them through these relationships. On the sell side of our relationship, we are committed to making sure that our customers retain or I should say obtain a competitive price and we know where the market price is for our customers on a molecule by molecule basis and we are committed to making sure that they remain competitive. And in the middle, between those are the spread or the return that we get for the work that we do. So, I think we see a more normalized generic market as compared to the recent past and we are confident we continue to manage that business on both the buying side and the selling side appropriately.
Brian Tanquilut: I appreciate it. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs.
Robert Jones: Great. Thanks for the questions. I just wanted to go back to the U.S. pharma and specialty business and how you are thinking about growth over time, I know you have mentioned Rite-Aid, we have talked about contract renewals, obviously M&A is always going to be a part of the algorithm, but John, if you take a step back you know the guidance for flat to down mid single-digit EBIT in that segment obviously a lot of moving pieces in ‘19, but if you take a step back, how are you thinking about growth in that business? I mean, is it flat to down the right algorithm or do you think that there is things based on even some of the things you just discussed, is there ways that could expand EBIT, grow EBIT as we look forward maybe even beyond ‘19 in the U.S. pharma and specialty segment?
John Hammergren: Robert, I want to turn this question over to Britt in just a moment, because he has spent some time thinking about it. But I would – my earlier answer related to the total value proposition we delivered to our customers is part of the way we begin to grow profitability in the direction of revenue growth and clearly, that’s a priority for us. There are some near-term headwinds partially driven by mix, partially driven by our anticipation of contract renewals, I would say for the most part that the business is positioned to perform well and we really have a foundation setting year going on in our U.S. pharma and specialty business, but Britt maybe you can add some color?
Britt Vitalone: Yes, thanks for the question. I would say that our ‘19 guide is really reflective of some of the customer loss activity in transition, but Rite-Aid stores that we mentioned during our prepared remarks, but as we think about that business, specialty has been outlined for us as one of the key pillars. We think we have a lot of services and capabilities that we can provide not only our customers, but our manufacturing partners. And we think that’s going to position us well to participate in the growth of specialty from a dollar profit growth perspective. We have also made a number of acquisitions that we outlined through FY ‘18 that we believe are going to continue to strengthen our position in not only specialty, but the manufacturer services component of that business. While we have some near-term headwinds as John outlined, the business we believe is well positioned to take advantage of growing specialty marketplace.
Robert Jones: That’s helpful. And then I guess just to follow-up, you guys mentioned a multiyear cost initiative, can you share anything just as far as how much of that is expected to impact ‘19? And then I guess more specifically where within the segments and the corporate line should we be expecting to see a lot of those initiatives start to take hold?
Britt Vitalone: Yes, sure. As we mentioned in our earlier remarks, we are in the preliminary phase of our operating model work. We have outlined for you an expected set of restructuring charges for that preliminary base and we have also outlined for you that we expect that these savings that will generate will be modest in FY ‘19 as we build through some of these capabilities and some of these cost programs that we are looking at. So, we are in early phases of it. In FY ‘19 you should expect to see some investments and some savings that will help fund those investments that will really benefit us as we go into ‘20 and beyond.
Robert Jones: Alright. Thanks so much.
Operator: We will take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser: Yes, good morning and thank you for taking my question. The narrative out of Washington is very focused on the middleman and we are getting a lot of questions from investors about what a potential shift away from gross to net pricing model could impact you guys? So, John, can you just kind of like help us think through that and also how does – how and does this is being reflected in the some of the conversation that you are having with the manufacturers?
John Hammergren: Well, thanks for the question, Ricky. Clearly, there is – unless the government decides to impose some type of price methodology and price fixing or some type of price controls like we have in other socialized countries, but the gross to net discussion is really one that is in some control with the pharmaceutical manufacturers. And as we analyze what’s being said and we think the question of middleman is primarily focused on people outside of the pharmaceutical wholesaling business, the people that are heavily involved in receiving and/or processing rebates, incentives etcetera. So, we don’t think the focus and the discussion is really wholesalers’ business model and so that will be a part of my reflection on the question. And the second is that you can imagine that at the net price it’s realized by pharmaceutical manufacturers is a derivative of all of the discounts that they are providing and rebates they are providing to many, many different customers. And if you were to think about how they would move to a single price and what effect that would have on their profitability, it will be quite dramatic. I don’t think the manufacturers would be inclined to move to a single price for all of their customers and to not use – to go forward without using some type of rebate in their incentive programs to recognize the various discounts that are required to obtain business from different players in the industry. Having said all of that if they were to pursue some type of an environment where our business model has changed and the economics would change for us, we would do what we have done in the past, which is to sit down with the manufacturers. I reflect to them what their change in behavior has done to our profitability or could do to our profitability and we recoup that profitability by reorienting our agreements in a different fashion. We did this in the past when we went from a purchase process where we were focused on price inflation to a more stabilized environment through fees and we would do a very similar process with the manufacturers in this environment where we attempt to recapture the dollars that are involved here through a different mechanism. And I think we will be successful as we were before. No one in the supply chain has indicated an interest in getting rid of wholesalers and no one is focused on taking away our slim margins. No one has talked to me about the fact that they can find better utility in some other fashion. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. Our provider customers are using us more and more. They are relying more and more on our service. They order more and more of their products through shutting down their own warehousing. They are dismantling their own purchasing activities. So, they are focused on partnering closely with us. And on the manufacturer side, they are doing the same. They are more and more dependent on our national redistribution center and more focused on our manufacturer services in fact going more and more away from their own operations and using McKesson as a valued partner. So, although there maybe some disruption certainly concerns in a process of the transition that would be significant, I think we would emerge on the other side where we are today are better.
Ricky Goldwasser: That’s very helpful. Thank you. And then Britt just one follow-up question on the guidance, I mean, obviously there is a wide range in guidance for U.S. North America operating income, it’s somewhere between flat to $150 million. You highlighted Rite-Aid, it’s about a third of the impact. So when we think about the low end of the guidance when we think about the swing factor, what is the biggest factor there outside of Rite-Aid, is it the sell side contracts renegotiation that you highlighted earlier in the call or is it something else?
Britt Vitalone: No, well, thanks for the question. As John mentioned, we fully factor in all of the upcoming renewals into our guidance. So that’s already in there. I think what we are reflecting here is as we talked about before we have a couple of customer losses through consolidation in transition with Rite-Aid that is providing a little bit of a near-term headwind for us, but we continue to invest in the business through some of the acquisitions that we have outlined before and we believe that those acquisitions will continue to add value and be accretive to us over the longer term. So I think our guidance on the flat to down mid single-digit as you identified is really reflective of couple of customer losses that we talked about earlier in the call.
John Hammergren: And perhaps, Ricky, what folks have missed is that there was a very large acquisition in the grocery business that affected us negatively and we don’t typically talk about specific customers or contracts and maybe some people measure that transaction and its effect on us as well in other grocery operators. We had a couple of transitions last year that we had not anticipated and really do largely to consolidation and we don’t anticipate that going forward, but you see it reflected at least partially in our guidance in addition to the loss of nearly half of those Rite-Aid stores.
Britt Vitalone: And I would just reiterate as I talked about the generic environment, we do see a continuing competitive environment, but a more stable environment. I think that’s an important factor to just remind you of.
Ricky Goldwasser: Which basically means that it might be a headwind, but it’s a stable one, so as we think about that range we should factor that as well, is that fair?
John Hammergren: I think as I mentioned the sell side environment is competitive as it always has been, but it’s a very stable environment now as opposed to what we saw in fiscal ‘17.
Ricky Goldwasser: Okay, thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Eric Percher with Nephron Research.
Eric Percher: Thank you. I wanted to go back to the question on pharma and specialty and maybe you could put more simply, what is your view of the organic growth rates top line as well as the type of margin leverage de-leverage you would see on an organic basis kind of taking away the noise that we are seeing at the moment?
John Hammergren: Well, thanks for that question, Eric. I will start off with that as we have outlined in our guidance here, our revenue is expected to grow low to mid single-digit. Now, that is reflective of some of the headwinds that we have already identified in our U.S. pharma business. Specialty is clearly the fastest growing product category in the marketplace today and while it has an impact on our margin rate, we are still participating well in growing margin dollars as a result of that specialty growth. And add to that, some of the things we have already talked about our position in specialty and some of the investments that we have made in specialty, it helps us to really leverage and capitalize on those opportunities to grow with specialty. So I think what you are seeing in our overall segment guide is a reflection of the headwinds from the customer losses, but specialty continues to grow nicely and we are continuing to participate in that op profit dollar growth.
Eric Percher: I was just going to say is it fair to say that in a normal – given mix shift, the op profit growth would be modestly less than the revenue growth that’s reasonable, the investments that you are making are to drive op profit growth at or better than the top line growth rate?
Britt Vitalone: I think that’s a fair way to characterize it.
John Hammergren: Thanks, operator. I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: And we will take our final question from Michael Cherny with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.
Michael Cherny: Good morning and thanks for the details so far. So one last question on the U.S. EBIT growth rate, you talked about some of the potential headwinds as you think about the bottom end of the range, if we get to the top end of the range in terms of the flattish number, where are the biggest drivers of that, is it better branded pricing that you expect, is it a push-out of some of the renewal pressure that you may or may not be feeling just trying to understand the full range of outcomes there to understand where the numbers could shake out as you are thinking about the various moving pieces in your business over the course of the year?
John Hammergren: Thanks for that question. I think as we think about the range, there is a number of factors that can drive it. I have given you an idea of what our assumption is on branded pricing environment, which we expect to be similar to FY ‘18. So, certainly if the branded pricing inflation environment is different that could certainly impact it. We are very excited about the contributions from ClarusONE we think that we are making great progress there. We certainly have a lot of other opportunities in other product categories as we have talked about today and so that certainly is an element for us that we think that can help us continue to grow and to help our customers grow. And as specialty continues to grow and we continue to position ourselves well with some of the investments that we have made, I think that we are well-positioned to continue to take advantage of that. So, these are few of the factors that I would point out that could help us to get to closer to the top end of that range.
Michael Cherny: Thanks. That’s all I have.
John Hammergren: Well, I want to thank you operator for your help today and thanks also to all of you on the call for your time. We have a clear strategy and a solid operating plan for fiscal 2019 and exciting growth opportunities across McKesson. Please enjoy the holiday weekend. And now, I will hand the call off to Craig for a review of his upcoming events for the financial community. Craig?
Craig Mercer: Thank you, John. We will participate in the Goldman Sachs Global Healthcare Conference in Southern California on June 13 and we will be hosting an Investor Day event on June 28 in Boston. We look forward to seeing you in the new fiscal year. Thank you and good bye.
Operator: Thank you for joining today’s conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the McKesson Third Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Craig Mercer. Please go ahead sir.
Craig Mercer: Thank you, Ciciliya. Good morning and welcome to the McKesson’s fiscal 2018 third quarter earnings call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and Britt Vitalone, McKesson’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update and then Britt will review the financial results for the quarter. After Britt’s comments we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end to call promptly after one hour at 9:00 AM Eastern Time. Before we begin, I'll remind listeners that during the course of this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the Company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, John and Britt will reference adjusted earnings, adjusted operating profit margin excluding non-controlling interests, and items excluding foreign currency exchange effects. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information for investors with regard to the Company's operating performance, and comparability of financial results period-over-period. Please refer to our press release announcing third quarter fiscal 2018 results for further information, and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thank you, and here's John Hammergren.
John Hammergren: Thanks, Craig, and thanks everyone for joining us on our call. Today, we reported solid operational performance and we have raised and narrowed fiscal 2018 guidance range of $11.80 to $12.50, to a new range of $12.50 to $12.80, driven by a lower tax rate and lower share count. First the third quarter we generated total company revenues of more than $53 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.41.  Before I delve into the details of the quarter let me briefly touch on a couple of recent developments. We are excited to have just closed the acquisition of RxCrossroads. We are committed to broadening and deepening our portfolio of solutions and services to better serve our pharmaceutical and biotechnology or biopharma manufacturer partners’ needs. Our vision is to be the partner of choice across the product life cycle by creating a comprehensive, best-in-class, differentiated set of services. RxCrossroads expands and improves our existing services and third-party logistics, reimbursement access and health and pharmacy solutions. It also compliments our offerings to include upstream plasma logistics and specialized field support. The integration of this business with our existing biopharma facing solutions will enhance our ability to provide turnkey solutions for our manufacturer partners. To assure patients get access to innovative therapies to enable rapid market penetration of products and help manufactures create value. And for payers, we can provide evidence in a value-based way to highlight the best solutions for the patients they server. In summary, we have a unique set of capabilities that bring a superior value proposition to our bio pharma partners. In the third quarter we made the decision to bring the capabilities of our Specialty Health and businesses under Nick Loporcaro’s strong leadership, which will allow us to more closely coordinate and optimize how we provide service and solutions to our manufacturer and provider partners across the health care landscape. Many of you have met Nick at prior Investor Day events. He brings extensive experience to leadership positions he has held at McKesson Canada and McKesson Specialty Health. As some of you may recall when we were beginning to build our specialty franchise more than a decade ago, we made the decision to carve out these assets from our U.S. Pharmaceutical business in order to incubate high growth opportunity to maturity. Now that our specialty franchise is well established and a leader in the market, a decision to combine Specialty Health and U.S. Pharmaceutical under Nick’s leadership is a natural next step in the evolution of these businesses. And for retail pharmacy customers with our recent acquisition of acquisition of Well.ca, we have strengthened our ecommerce capabilities hopping to provide an omni-channel presence in serving our customers in a way that works for them. In addition to leveraging digital capabilities, our suite of retail pharmacy services extends beyond simply filling the prescription. For instance, we connect the patient digitally with the pharmacists for medication education, treatment protocols and medicine scheduling reminders, which drive adherence across our global retail footprint. Turning now to our business results, our North American pharmaceutical distribution and services businesses, which include U.S. Pharmaceutical, McKesson Specialty Health, McKesson Canada and McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions, had year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter of 7% on a constant currency basis. I'd like to discuss a few highlights in U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Health. The business is now headed by Nick. I'm extremely pleased with the progress of ClarusONE and its strong contribution to our results this year. We have contracted a diverse range of manufacturers delivering benefits to our partner Walmart and more broadly, with all of our customers who purchase generics through us, helping them to be more successful in a competitive and dynamic market. Next we continue to implement differential pricing for brand, generic, specialty, biosimilar and OTC drug classes, as they work through our contract renewal cycles. We are pleased with the results and remain focused on receiving fair compensation for the services we provide for each drug category. Finally, we are working closely with Rite to ensure the successful transition of the allotted stores to Wallgreen. We continue to deliver exceptional value to Rite every day and we remain comfortable that our sourcing scale and capability has not been – will be impacted by this transition. In addition to my earlier comments on the RxCrossroads’ acquisition, and the breadth of our capabilities we are building and the support of biopharma companies, the intraFUSION acquisition enhances our muti-specialty footprint with the focus on neurology and rheumatology. I’m happy to report that the team is executing the integration plan and we are doing well relative to the business case. Additionally, the BDI Pharma business we acquired last quarter is a solid compliment to our existing plasma offering that allows us to expand plasma and biologics distributions into specialty pharmacy and homecare with differentiated expertise. We’re also pleased with the progress on integrating this transaction. I’ll move next to our Canadian business, where we saw nice growth in the quarter with constant currency results that were in line with our expectations as we passed the one year mark, following our acquisition of Rexall. We’re also encouraged by the progress we’re making on integrating and executing against the business cases of our Uniprix and GMD Distribution acquisitions. Before I move on, I wanted to comment on the recently announced generic price initiative by the Canadian Provincial Government. The initiative, which is effect of April 1, 2018, will reduce the pricing of approximately 70 commonly used generic drugs. We have a broad range of businesses in Canada which are growing strongly. While certain of our businesses will be affected by this initiative, we are evaluating the economic impact of these reductions. We are engaged in the dialogue with the governments around ensuring fair compensation for the wholesale and retail services we provide to drive better health. And within our prescription, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions business, which has demonstrated excellent revenue growth, CoverMyMeds is honored with Frost & Sullivan's 2017 North American Visionary Innovation Leadership Award, recognizing our prior authorization solutions. While this award highlights the innovation and solutions we bring to the market, more important it demonstrates how we deliver value to pharmacists, manufactures, providers and payors. Turning now to our results for International Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services, we made progress on addressing the challenges facing our UK retail business that we announced in conjunction with our second quarter results. We are actively in the process of either closing or selling approximately 200 retail pharmacy locations. Although we have concerns with the current UK reimbursement environment, we remain committed to supporting our pharmacy customers. We do this by making it easier for patients to get what they need, whether they are through services like Click and Collect, Lloyds Online Doctor or the ability to consult with a pharmacist when you visit a store. Additionally, we collect data and provide analytics which helps retail pharmacies manage individual patients, drive adherence and deliver better health outcomes. When we put these assets together, it demonstrates how our investments provide pharmacies with a comprehensive offering to reduce time and administrative activities, while improving the focus on patient care. And finally, our medical surgical business continues to be one of the fastest growing businesses in our portfolio, reflecting strong market growth, including the benefits from a shift to lower class sites of care. We continue to expand our services to medical surgical manufactures. I’ll highlight our success in the last business where we serve as a sales team for certain manufactures that focus on the physician and community hospital labs. This is a great example of the unique value we will bring to the manufacturers for expanding the range of services our customers can provide to diagnose and treat patients for a variety of clinical conditions. In summary, I’m pleased with how our Distribution Solutions segment preformed in the third quarter.  Turning briefly to our Technology Solutions segment, beginning with this quarter, this segment consist solely of our 70% equity investment in Change Healthcare following the successful sale of our Enterprise Information Solutions business in early October. We continue to see progress against the execution of the business case and a realization of the anticipated cost synergies. Next let me take a moment to provide our perspective on the recently enacted federal tax reform. We’re a supporter of the tax reform and believe that it will allow U.S. companies to make new investments and to improve their competitive position. Our complex, and scope and nature we recognized a net benefit from the tax changes. Any cash realized from the reform will be deployed using our portfolio approach with the goal of delivering value for our shareholders through mix of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends.  In addition, we expect Change Healthcare to benefit from the recently enacted tax reform, given it is predominantly a U.S. focused business. Britt will provide you with more detail on the impact of tax reform. And to summarize, McKesson's fiscal third quarter results represented continued execution across the enterprise, and we are raising and narrowing our adjusted earnings guidance for fiscal 2018 from $11.80 to $12.50 to a new range of $12.50 to $12.80 per diluted share. Before I turn the call over to Britt Vitalone, our new CFO, I want to take a moment to thank James Beer for his contributions. I appreciate the support over the past four years. Some of you have already met Britt and know his background. But for those of you who don't, I'm happy to share some details with you. During his 12-year tenure with McKesson, Britt has led the corporate FDA and M&A finance functions, was CFO of our Medical-Surgical business and most recently served as CFO of our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Health businesses. He also has deep operational experience, which included the creation of the ClarusONE joint sourcing venture, which is delivering material generic sourcing benefits. While I'm pleased to have worked alongside James Beer over the last four years, our ability to immediately name a successor reflects our deep bench of talent. I look forward to continuing to work with Britt in his new role. With that, I'll turn the call over to Britt and return to address your questions when he finishes. Britt?
Britt Vitalone: Good morning. And thank you for your kind remarks, John. As this marks the first time I'm addressing our investment community on an earnings call, I want to take a moment to make a few opening remarks. I'd also like to start by thanking James Beer for his leadership over the past four years. He's had a tremendous impact on the company, and I've enjoyed working closely with him. I wish James all the best. I've been in the role a few weeks now, and I'm excited about the opportunities have in front of us, and the opportunity to serve as McKesson CFO. I look forward to working with our investors and the analyst community. Finally, I'm going to briefly mention our current segment reporting. With Paul Julian's retirement as of the beginning of the calendar year, we are currently evaluating our operating structure. I anticipate that this review will result in a change to our existing segment reporting structure beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We'll provide an update and additional details on our fourth quarter earnings call in May. Turning now to the results of our fiscal third quarter. Today, we reported third quarter adjusted EPS of $3.41, reflecting solid operating results, a lower tax rate driven in part by discrete tax benefits and a lower share count. And as a result of a lower tax rate and lower share count, we are raising and narrowing our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings outlook to $12.50 to 12.80 per diluted share. Let me start with a review of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. We believe the new tax law is positive for business and for McKesson. As noted in our press release this morning, our third quarter GAAP results reflect material benefit stemming from the tax act. Both McKesson and Change Healthcare recorded net benefits related to the tax act in the third quarter. These nonrecurring benefits are excluded from our adjusted earnings. In December, McKesson recorded a net tax benefit of approximately $370 million, which contributed $1.78 to our third quarter GAAP EPS. This net tax benefit results primarily to the re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities, principally related to LIFO due to a reduction in the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, partially offset by the impact of transition taxes and foreign retained earnings. In addition, Change Health recorded a net benefit, driven primarily by the re-measurement of its deferred tax liabilities at a lower tax rate. McKesson's 70% equity interest of that benefit is expected to be approximately $70 million to $110 million, which will be reflected in the equity investment in Change Healthcare line. However, given the 1-month lag in McKesson's reporting of our equity share of Change Healthcare, that benefit will be reflected in our fourth quarter GAAP results. Next, let me discuss the impact of federal tax reform on our adjusted earnings. For McKesson, beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we expect a lower rate driven by the new U.S. federal tax rate. We expect a tax run rate range of 22% to 24% driven by our mix of business. That said, each fiscal year's tax rate may be impacted by its pre-tax charges or benefits during the year from items, such as tax planning initiatives and examinations of our tax returns by the tax authorities. We anticipate our fiscal 2018 adjusted tax rate will be approximately 21%. I would remind you that are anticipated fiscal 2018 adjusted tax rate has been positively impacted by the intercompany sale of software related to our Technology Solutions segment in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. That P&L benefit is expected to end at the close of fiscal 2018 driven by a change income tax accounting rules. To summarize, we expect our fiscal 2019 adjusted tax rate to be above our fiscal 2018 adjusted tax rate, driven the by lapping of discrete tax items and the full year benefit related to software amortization realized in fiscal 2018. We'll provide an update on adjusted tax rates for fiscal 2019 and will provide guidance in May. For Change Healthcare, as I previously mentioned, we report these results in a one-month lag. And as a result, their fourth quarter will include the effects of the lower run rate for two months of Change Healthcare results. Specific to fiscal 2019, we'll provide additional insight on McKesson's expected adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare when we provide guidance in May. Finally, as a result of the tax act, we anticipate modestly favorable cash flows over time. We expect to deploy these favorable cash flows in line with our portfolio approach to capital deployment. While some of the items I've just discussed have an immediate impact, there are certain items within tax reform in which companies have up to a year to finalize. As such, we may have true-up's in future quarters. In our 10-Q we filed later today, you'll find additional information about the impact of federal tax reform and the provisional amounts recorded in the quarter. Now let me turn to financial results for fiscal third quarter. The results that I provide this morning will be on an adjusted basis, unless I specifically call them out as GAAP. We provided a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and our 8-K filed this morning. As a reminder, our adjusted earnings exclude the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments, LIFO inventory related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring charges and other adjustments. Starting now with a review of our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedules 2 and 3. For the third quarter, consolidated revenues increased 7% year-over-year. Adjusted gross profit dollars increased 2% from a year ago, adjusted operating expenses increased 3% year-over-year and adjusted other income was $22 million for the quarter. Adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $55 million for the third quarter, which was adversely impacted by a lower-than-expected contribution in Change Healthcare's imaging business due to deferrals of customer purchases. We now expect adjusted equity income from the Change Healthcare joint venture to be in a range of $265 million to $295 million in fiscal 2018. Interest expense of $67 million, decreased 9% for the quarter, driven primarily by the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates. Our adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 11.5%, driven by discrete tax benefits of approximately $54 million in the quarter, which primarily relates to the conclusion of certain tax audits. We now anticipate our fiscal 2018 adjusted tax rate will be approximately 21%, down from approximately 24%, driven in roughly equal parts by our expected mix of business, lower adjusted tax rate in the fourth quarter and the discrete tax benefits recognized in the third quarter. Income attributable to noncontrolling interests, or NCI, was $58 million for the quarter. As a reminder, the year-over-year increase in NCI is primarily driven by fee income from ClarusONE, our joint sourcing entity with Walmart Adjusted net income from continuing operations totaled $712 million, with third quarter adjusted EPS at $3.41, which is up 12% compared to $3.04 in the prior year. Third quarter year-over-year adjusted EPS growth was primarily driven by a lower share count, organic growth across multiple business units, including the company's strategic sourcing benefits through ClarusONE, incremental profit contribution from acquisition and a lower tax rate, which included discrete tax benefits, which are unrelated to tax reform. These positive drivers were partially offset by lower profit driven by the contribution of the majority of the Technology Solutions businesses of Change Healthcare, the sale of our EIS business and the impact of reduced reimbursement in our UK retail pharmacy business. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding were $208 million down 6% compared the prior year. Next, I'll review our segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3. Distribution Solutions segment revenues were $53.6. Revenues benefited from $663 million in favorable currency rate movements. On a constant currency basis revenues increased 7%, year-over-year. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 8%, driven by market growth and acquisitions partially offset by brand to generic conversion. International pharmaceutical distribution resources revenues were $7 billion this quarter. Revenues benefited from $530 million in favorable currency rate movements. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 4% driven by acquisitions and market growth. Our UK team continues to make progress in the retail pharmacy initiatives we outlined on our second quarter earnings call. To date, we've identified approximately 200 store closures and divestitures, which approximately 90 stores are expected to be divested. We continue to expect meaningful savings from this program in fiscal 2019. And finally, Medical-Surgical revenues increased 9%, for the third quarter driven by market growth. Distribution Solutions adjusted profit was up 20% for the quarter, driven by acquisitions and organic growth across multiple business units, including the company's strategic sourcing benefits through ClarusONE, partially offset by the impact of reduce reimbursement in our U. K. retail pharmacy business. Brand compensation for the third quarter was in line with expectation. Additionally, January brand manufacturer pricing activity was in line with our expectation, and we continue to see results slightly above our full year assumption of mid single digit brand manufacturer price inflation. I would point out that while the overall brand inflation rate is important, it is less important in prior years as we continue to evolve our brand compensation arrangements, reduce the variability from branded inflation. As it relates to the generic market environment, generic deflation on the buy side continues to be in line with our expectation. The sell-side pricing environment remains competitive yet less volatile than the year-ago period. Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating expenses increased 18% for the quarter. Segment operating expenses required an increase driven by acquisitions and the mix of retail business, partially offset by an ongoing cost management output.  As a reminder, in fiscal 2018, our year-over-year growth for adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating expenses are impacted by the shift of business in the segment, including our larger owned retail footprint and technology businesses. Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating profit increased 23% to $991 million, driven by the same factors as previously discussed. In constant currency, segment adjusted operating profit $982 million. As a remainder, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the McKesson's adjusted operating profit was negatively impacted by two nonrecurring charges showing approximately $60 million. The third quarter segment adjusted operating margin rate was 185 basis points an increase of 22 basis points. The adjusted margin rate was also impacted by our customer and product mix, including the growth of higher-priced specialty pharmaceuticals. Due to the mix shift, we now expect our full year Distribution Solutions adjusted operating margin rate to be slightly below our original guidance range of between 198 basis points and 208 basis points. McKesson recorded $109 million in adjusted corporate expenses for the third quarter. We now expect adjusted corporate expenses to be between approximately $410 million and $430 million in fiscal 2018. I’ll review our balance sheet metrics. Our receivables day’s sales outstanding decreased one day from the prior year to 27 days. Days sales in inventory decreased one day from the prior years to 30 days. Days sales in payables decreased one day from the prior year to 58 days. It's important to point out that our working capital metrics may be impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of a given quarter. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.6 billion and to the first nine months of fiscal 2018 we generated $1.3 billion in cash flow from operations. We continue to efficiently deploy capital. For the first nine months of fiscal 2018, we repaid $545 million in long term debt and we spend $392 million on internal capital investments. We now expect property acquisitions and capitalized software expenditures in fiscal 2018 to be below the previously guided range between $650 million and $750 million. And we spend $2 billion on seven acquisitions during the first nine months of fiscal 2018. In the third quarter, we repurchased $250 million in common stock. Share repurchases during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 totaled $900 million. We now expect our weighted average diluted shares to be approximately $210 million for the full year. We have approximately $1.8 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization and yesterday, the Board of Directors approved the next quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share. Now, let me provide more detail on our fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS outlook. As mentioned earlier, we have raised and narrowed our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings from a range of $11.80 to $12.50 per diluted share to a new range from $12.50 to $12.80 per diluted share. As a remainder, our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings outlook exclude the following items. Amortization, acquisition related to tangible of $2.35 to $2.65 per diluted share, acquisition related expenses and adjustments of $1 to $1.20 per diluted share, LIFO inventory-related charges of $0.05 – credits of $0.05 per diluted share, gains from antitrust legal settlements of up to $0.05 per diluted share, restructuring charges of $1.25 to $1.45 per diluted share and other net credits of $0.50 to $0.70 per diluted share. Unless stated otherwise today, the underlying assumptions that were detailed in our fourth quarter fiscal 2017 press release and on our first and second quarter fiscal 2018 earnings calls are being reiterated. We continue to expect foreign currency exchange rate movements will have a net favorable impact of approximately $0.10 for the year. In closing, our third quarter results were operationally in line with our expectations, and we're pleased to be able to raise our fiscal 2018 outlook to reflect the lower tax rate and share count. We are well positioned for a strong finish to fiscal 2018. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of I’d ask to limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. I’ll turn the call over to the operator.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Glen Santangelo from Deutsche Bank. Pease.
Glen Santangelo: Hi, thanks and good morning. Hey Britt I just want to sort of follow-up on the comments you just made about the operating profit assumptions within the Distribution Solutions segment. I think you sort of suggest that you now expect to come in slightly below the range, and I'm just kind of – could you give us a little bit more color? Because it kind of sounds like price inflation is sort of in line with what you thought, maybe a little better. Generic deflation is kind of what you thought. We're not seeing any sort of strange activity in terms of the competitive landscape. So could you maybe just landscape. So could you maybe just give us a little bit more color? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.
Britt Vitalone: Yes, sure. Thanks for that question. Yes, we did note here that we're going to be at the low end or slightly below the range. And I would attribute the to mix. As we talked about from quarter-to-quarter, we have a variety of mix between both products and customers, and I think that's really driving that comment. As we noted, it was an in-line quarter, but I would just point out to the mix of both product and customers.
Glen Santangelo: Maybe I could just ask one follow-up. John, you talked about differential pricing, and you're sort of going through repricing all your contracts sort of one by one. Any sort of takeaways from those repricings? Any impact on the margin that sort of worth calling out as we look on a go-forward basis? 
John Hammergren: Well thanks for the question Glen. Clearly, we've talked about the importance of our work in this area. And I think our customers clearly understand that the mix changes going on in our industry is more and more as these specialty products are coming to the marketplace. And so I think in the short term, it has little impact on us or our customers, but as we reposition in advance of what we see is a cycle of a lot of specialty product, into the marketplace, we think these adjustments are appropriate for us. And frankly provide better line of sight to our customers related to all these products flow through the supply chain. So we're making good progress, and we would expect to be complete with this, as you noted, these final contracts renew in the last section of this work.
Glen Santangelo: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Lisa Gill from JPMorgan.
Lisa Gill: Thanks very much and good morning. Let me start on the drug pricing side. Clearly, there are still a lot of debate in Washington around drug pricing, Trump coming out the other night and talking about it. John, can you talk about how you expected to impact your business going forward. You talk about stabilization here. You know talking about mid-single digits, what are the things that you potentially could see? I know you spent some time in DC, so let me start there and then I just had a follow-up as well.
John Hammergren: Well, I think you can break the drug pricing discussion into probably three large categories. Clearly, we continue to believe generic pricing and the related deflation we've experienced recently in that marketplace makes a generic product price very competitive. And certainly, as a percent of the total spend in health care, the price for these kinds of drugs or the treatment cost for patients continues to drop. And we think that, that phenomenon some of the pressure off the drug spend debate in this country and clearly, providing people with continued drug benefits also helps diffuse this. And for many folks that are on these drugs, the cost is somewhat immaterial to them on an annual basis. On the branded drugs, you've seen a significant drop in inflation, if you think about the trend in that indicator over the last several years. And likewise, we think that the level of brand inflation that we have now is acceptable and defendable by these companies as they continue to use the remaining product they have under patent to fund their increased R&D work. And the last category I'd point out is – are some of these new specialty drugs. And clearly, these drugs can be expensive, but, once again, when pressed, I think there's easy arguments to be made for how the use of these drugs and an analysis would show a decrease in the cost of health care for the patients that are on these treatments. And so in a value-based way, if people are thinking about health care spend and how to control it, I still think the use pharmaceuticals is the first and best place to go and get people on their treatments, get them to stay on them and adhere to the treatment and stay out of the hospitals.
Lisa Gill: So even though – the rhetoric is still there, and from your perspective, it doesn't sound like things have really changed from what they were one year ago. Is that the right way to think about it?
John Hammergren: Well, you obviously have continued to see deflation in the generic side, and like I said, we've seen a significant reduction in the amount inflation on the brand side. And I think the area that continues to get some scrutiny are some of these specialty drugs that have a small population that are very expensive to bring to the marketplace and a more value-oriented request as pharmaceutical companies price these to compare what the other treatment might have cost our society or a payer. And so I think that there will be continued value-based discussions, but, frankly, I think the evidence will show that the spend on pharmaceuticals is an investment that's well made and one that pays a return compared to other alternatives. So I think, obviously, people that are in some of these categories, particularly the specialty categories, as a patient may find the debate interesting. But I think that as it relates to overall drug spend as a value, it continues to be one of the best values in health care today.
Lisa Gill: Okay, great. And then, Britt, just going back to your comment about the mix and talking about specialty. But I'm just curious around flu and what the impact of flu will have in your projections for the fourth quarter. I generally think of that as being a little bit of a lower-margin product. Is that having any impact on the way you're thinking about the margins for the fourth quarter?
Britt Vitalone: I'd say that we've had a pretty strong flu season, I would say, as part of the product mix that I've talked about, along with specialty products. So that would be a part of the range that we provided you.
Lisa Gill: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please.
Ricky Goldwasser: Yes. Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Just a couple of questions here. John, you mentioned the changes in reimbursement in Canada. I'd just kind of like help to frame the potential impact. Can you just walk through kind of what would be the profit contribution of Canada overall? We have it at around 7% of EBITDA. And any additional color on how these reimbursement changes compare to what you've seen in the past? Because there have been periods in the past where we've seen these generic price initiatives, and you were able kind of like to manage through them.
John Hammergren: Thanks, Ricky, for the question. As you point out, the Canadian business is significant to McKesson and important and has continued to grow nicely. And in the past, we have been impacted negatively from reimbursement changes that have sort of rolled through various provinces at different periods in time. It's probably early to size the impact of these most recent changes or what work we might be able to do to find reimbursement channels for the services we provide in retail or wholesale from the government or other offsets that we might find in the business as we continue to grow in the wide variety of businesses that we are in, in the Canada market. I would say the difference this time compared to the other types of reimbursement events is that this one is across all provinces, all at the same time, effective April 1, and not insignificant in its impact on that portion of our business, the generic business. So I think it's important for us to point it out. We'll talk about it more as we get into our guidance for next year and think about it as we work through the discussions we have with the Canadian government related to what services they want to reimburse us for, et cetera. So I think it's important, but it's something that we are used to, to the extent that we've had to deal with this in the past.
Ricky Goldwasser: And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the tax benefit and kind of like how you're thinking of investing back into the business, you talked about acquisitions, buybacks and dividends. But when you think about kind of like the capital initiatives, is there any kind of like way that you can help us kind of like think through it and quantify it as we're kind of like thinking about the pull-through to fiscal year 2019?
John Hammergren: Well, I think Britt has already outlined sort of his expectations from a tax rate perspective. We, I think, provided a range, and that should be helpful to you. As it relates to the use of the incremental cash produced by this very favorable tax law change, I think our comment was we will continue to follow a portfolio approach, and that's probably the most color I can provide you. You know that we do have a great track record of making intelligent acquisitions and not overpaying for them and doing a great job of integrating the acquisitions. And so that continues to be one of our top priorities, but you also notice that we've done relatively significant share repurchases this year. And we will probably continue to use both of those, along with our dividends, as a strategy to grow. I do think that we are beginning an innovation phase at McKesson that we're excited about, that is more than just the M&A side of things. And so although acquisitions have played a role in the past, I think that we will find a way to provide innovation and opportunity to grow organically inside of McKesson, and that's some of the investment that we plan to make.
Ricky Goldwasser: Thank you.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Brian Tanquilut: Good morning, guys. Just wanted to ask a question on the ClarusONE comment. So how do we – how should we think about the remaining opportunity there in terms of either expanding the relationship with Walmart or expanding the client base and product lines? And what's your outlook on incremental margin opportunities with ClarusONE? Thanks.
John Hammergren: Well, thanks for the question. It's great to have Britt here at the table, given that he was the one that built ClarusONE and got it implemented on time and produced results that were not only at our expectations but perhaps beyond, and it's the same thing for our partners that have benefited. Britt, maybe you can talk a little bit more about the opportunities we see.
Britt Vitalone: Sure, John. We're very pleased with the progress that we've made at Clarus, and we're very pleased that our partner, Walmart, and our customers are benefiting from that. And we have quite a bit of opportunity as we go forward, whether that be geographic opportunities outside of the U.S. or as we look at other product opportunities. And certainly, we have those discussions with our partners all the time. So we believe that we've really got a great foundation in place. We've been able to partner with a number of manufacturers and really develop a beachhead around generics in the U.S., and we think we have tremendous foundation to take that further, whether that be, again, additional geographies or additional product categories. So we are quite excited about the potential that we have there, and we'll continue to explore that over the coming quarters.
Brian Tanquilut: All right, got it. Thanks, guys.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Eric Coldwell from Baird. Please go ahead.
Eric Coldwell: Hey, thanks very much and good morning. Medical, I know it's not your biggest segment, but 9% growth is pretty impressive, especially on the heels of a peer's pre-announcement last night, realizing that there are channel differences. I'm just curious if you can give us a little more detail, parse out product categories that are growing quickly. Maybe talk about share capture or specific initiatives leading to this 9% growth rate. And then maybe give us a sense on how comfortable you are with that level of a growth rate going forward, if you are so. Thanks, John. Thanks very much.
John Hammergren: Thanks for the question and thanks for recognizing what we think is really outstanding performance in our Medical-Surgical business. We have built a tremendous asset there that has been entirely focused on growing with our customers as they grow outside of the acute care health care system. And whether it's large health systems that are buying physician practices or whether it's long-term care centers or home care, we think we're extremely well positioned. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are expanding the product portfolio and the value that we deliver to our customers each day. And an example would be bringing lab and diagnostic into the physician office space. The – increasingly, technology is allowing us to do things right then and there in the physician office with the patient. The patient gets immediate results. The physician gets immediate results. Treatment decisions can be made immediately. And all can happen in a way that delivers better value for the patient, better care for the patient and, clearly, improved economics for the physicians. So there are several examples where we've extended our reach into these important markets, which expands our footprint. We've maintained and grown our business even through the acquisitions of doctors in the health systems market because of the value proposition that we deliver and our unique capabilities to service these disparate facilities in a low-cost, high-quality way, and we think the business is going to continue to grow. As mentioned earlier by Lisa, obviously, the flu market has been something that has also benefited us. Albeit not as profitable, it's an important part of the value proposition both in retail as well as in the ambulatory or physician office setting. So we benefited from some tailwinds relative to flu season. But I think our focus on the business and our great people there has also enhanced our performance. Next question please.
Operator: Next question comes from Ross Muken from Evercore. Please.
Ross Muken: Good morning, guys. Maybe, John, could you just give us a little bit more color on some of the more recent acquisitions or some of the new segments you've formed have kind of trended? It feels like you sort of did a number of deals that kind of aided your core growth rate and maybe also margins. So a little bit of color on some of those would be helpful. And then maybe a comment on sort of the RxCrossroads deal and sort of what that brings capability-wise to the organization.
John Hammergren: Well, thanks for the question, Ross. You've followed the company for a long time as well as some of your colleagues on this call. And if you watch what we do, it typically is arraying a set of assets in advance of opportunities fully materializing so that we can capitalize on the right strategic positions in advance of growth. We like things that are growing in an accretive way to the base. We like things that are providing margin opportunities that are accretive to our margin, and we like to be positioned in markets where the total available market is significant and where we believe it's going to grow rapidly and where we can win. So whether you think about our movement into the generic marketplace or our movement into alternate-site Medical-Surgical, we try to think about a go-forward where the growth will be. Similarly, you've seen us array a set of assets beginning with OTN against the oncology business years ago, probably over a decade ago, than the acquisition of U.S. Oncology and a string of other things that have positioned us for the specialty market, the most recent being RxCrossroads, as you just mentioned. So I think it is important for us to continue to grow our businesses and the value we can deliver to specialty manufacturers, not just in the supply chain but also in the ability for their product to be launched effectively, to be reimbursed effectively and quickly. And for the patient and the physicians and the pharmacies to be supported as these products are taken up by the patients is an important aspect of what we're trying to do. And clearly, working on the revenue side of specialty pharma provides a lot of incremental value to our manufacturer partners. And so anything we can do to get the script in the appropriate hands of a patient and properly filled and taken and adhered to is delivering tremendous value to the patient to begin with, but also delivering tremendous value to our partners in the supply chain. So we're excited about the value proposition that we're creating.
Ross Muken: Thanks, John. And maybe a quick one for Britt, and welcome to the call. I guess, on just cash flow, a decent drain so far both year-to-date on working cap and deferred taxes. What is the updated view on sort of what the free cash number could kind of look at for the year? I am not sure I caught that.
Britt Vitalone: Yeah, I would say there is no change to our expectations on cash flow at this time. It's, as I mentioned in my remarks, it's – where the end of the quarter finishes in terms of the day also has a big impact, and it's not unusual to see us have a strong fourth quarter for cash flow, and so for that – those reasons, I would say that we're not changing our expectations on generating free cash flow for fiscal 2018.
Ross Muken: Great, thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Robert Jones: Thanks for taking my question. John, just want to go back to the public focus on drug pricing. One of the recent initiatives that we saw was led by hospitals with this idea of building out their own generic drug company to drive better accessibility and drive down price, obviously, with specific generic drugs. Just wanted to get your thoughts on that initiative specifically, how you think it could impact the industry? And then maybe just more generally, kind of what you're hearing and seeing from your hospital customers around drug pricing.
John Hammergren: Well, I certainly read the announcement with some interest. We've been in the Generic business for a long time, and we've, obviously, built our NorthStar product line and great collaboration with the pharmaceutical manufacturers and delivered significant value back into the marketplace. I think that my interpretation of what's going on there is really related to availability, to a large extent; and to some extent, perhaps pricing. And probably those are two – those two things are tied together to some extent. I'm not sure that another manufacturer will necessarily dramatically improve the availability. If it's a raw material-related issue or just a capacity-related issue. It's difficult to bring capacity on and it's, obviously, difficult to get through all of the regulatory challenges associated with standing up a brand-new company. Having said that, there may be opportunities for these large and important customers, some of which are ours to work in a collaborative way with others in the supply chain to avail themselves of better product availability or supply and certainly to take their buying power and aggregate it in a way that gives them some price leverage in the marketplace. So we look forward to exploring opportunities, as you said, on these limited number of generic products that have been difficult to our customers and for the market and anything we can do to help them. I would say that I'm a little suspect of the ability to ground up a generic manufacturing company that's owned in a collaborative way and to compete with our largest generic manufacturing partners in a material way. I just don't see that as being a simple task.
Robert Jones: Yeah, understood. I guess just one quick follow up, John, with one quarter left in the fiscal year, I know you guys will be getting formal guidance at a later time. But any initial thoughts as you look out to next year as we think about the major drivers? You talked about branded, generic pricing, volumes. Anything that you would foresee kind of stable, down or up as we look out into fiscal 2019?
John Hammergren: Well, as we have said in the past, we go through periods in these markets that sometimes can be a little bit difficult to predict. But as we see it now at least, the markets remain competitive but relatively stable. We've, for a long time, dealt with a deflationary generic market with spots of inflation and the clearly those dynamics seem to have settled into a pattern flat that at least for the last few quarters, have been pretty similar in their compare. And I think the biggest change we see coming in front of us, as I mentioned earlier, is an innovation cycle, particularly in specialty drugs that will be important. And the support of those manufacturers that need to get access to the product and access to the market, I should say and speed to delivery to the patient will be important. And I talked a little bit earlier about things that we try to do to make that simpler. CoverMyMeds will be another great example where we try to reduce the friction associated with getting somebody approved to begin to take one of these drugs in an automated prior authorization format. So that's the longer-term change I continue to see coming, which is a mix change into these more difficult to take – or difficult to pay for, difficult to get access to and difficult disease states that these new drugs are going to be marketed to.
Robert Jones: Great, thanks for the thoughts.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Kevin Caliendo from Needham. Please go ahead.
Kevin Caliendo: Thanks, guys, a couple of questions. First, you've done a lot of acquisitions on the manufacturing services, specialty side. Is there any capabilities or verticals there that you don't have yet that you feel you might need to sort of provide everything you can possibly provide to the manufacturers?
John Hammergren: Well, clearly, there is all kinds of things that the manufacturers either do internally or are already sourcing from partners, and that list of activity is pretty long and significant and probably changing. We do think that the assets that we put together are important. It gives us important scale, it gives as existing customer relationships and it gives us a foundation in services that may not be entirely complete if you think packaging and outsourced manufacturing and some of those kinds of capabilities. But we think that parts of the manufacturer requirement, particularly, as I said, on the revenue and adherence side, are important. And we believe that our focus in that direction has been an appropriate one, and we can benefit our partners as well as ourselves by being world-class in our ability to make that happen. So I think we remain disciplined and vigilant as it relates to opportunities, but I don't think we feel like we are at a disadvantage in terms of what we have today and we will be opportunistic to evaluate other alternatives that may come along.
Kevin Caliendo: Okay. And one question just on foreign exchange and the benefit. Is that – you mentioned it's $0.10 – you still expect it to be sort of a $0.10 impact to earnings this year. But is it – what does it do to the actual margin of the business? I'm guessing it's a negative impact to the margin overall then. As you look at the reconciliation…
John Hammergren: Yeah, as I would just point out that it’s – as we talked about, it's about a $0.10 impact. So it's a pretty modest impact on our operations at this point.
Kevin Caliendo: No, what I meant was you're taking an extra revenue. I'm just wondering has any material impact on your margin at all, the optics around it. I understand your…
Britt Vitalone: Yeah, it’s not a material impact. It's not a material impact.
Kevin Caliendo: Great, okay, thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Eric Percher from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Eric Percher: Thank you. Glad to hear that you’re considering financial segment and how that might change. But my question is actually maybe John your comments early on around the operational segmentation under Nick, how much of that is driven by simply these are now similar growth businesses versus change in what a manufacturer or dispenser needs from their wholesaler kind of the go-to-market strategy that you have. Is that changing as well and how does that fit into the operational change?
John Hammergren: Right, I think that clearly many of the manufacturers that we do business with that would be selling product through our specialty channels or into the physician office or clinic setting are the same manufacturers that are in our full-line wholesale business going to hospitals or retail pharmacy. The service requirement is significantly different, and the structure of our relationships are usually significantly different. So I think that what we'll be able to do here is benefit from the relationships we have on the various sides of our business. Frankly, we'll go to leverage some of the structure we have, whether it's some of the functions that we have in these businesses that have been specifically focused on one business versus the other. And I think that the most important thing for us to do is to continue to think the needs of our customers whether it’s a pharmacy or the physician or the pharmaceutical manufacturer and make sure that we array the set of assets to them in the best possible way and frankly also keep our cost and our overhead down so that we can be quick and efficient. So it's probably a combination of many things. Obviously, underneath Nick are some very talented executives, and their line of sight focus on U.S. Oncology or some of the other ologies and businesses that we're focused on will remain. So I don't see a collapsing, so to speak, of the people that are selling things to hospitals into the same group that's servicing our U.S. Oncology network is an example.
Eric Percher: And as you look at the segmentation, is there more room to run with the corporate efficiency program [indiscernible] in the innings of – I mean do you expect that to continue on into next year? 
John Hammergren: I’ll let Britt jump in here. Yes I would say, Eric, we have certainly, as John mentioned, as we think about a ring, our business is under a leader like Nick, as we look across all of our businesses. We've made great progress against our corporate expense in our segment expense initiatives. I think we still have tremendous opportunity, and we always focus on efficiency and looking to take cost opportunities so that we can better service our customers. So I think those are things that we'll always do, and I think we've made great progress in the last 18 months, but you should see us continue to focus on as we go forward.
Eric Percher: And just relative to the next year, as we look at this year, has the management incentive plan been at – fully funded? Is there any catch-up that has to occur as we go from 2018 to 2019? 
John Hammergren: Why – we don't – I don't – to be frank, I haven't looked at the management incentive plan accruals recently, but I don't think there's a huge delta last year to this year or this year into a fully funded or less than kind of funded basis. So it's not something I think that will be something you have to focus on, Eric, as we think about FY'19, yes.
Eric Percher: Okay, thank you.
Operator: We will now take our next question from George Hill from RBC. Please go ahead.
George Hill: Yes, good morning guys. John, as we think about the differentiated pricing model, what should we think of is the key drivers of profit growth going forward? Is it underlying volume? Is it price? Is it business mix like it business mix like the growth in specialty business versus generic growth? I guess any color here would be helpful. 
John Hammergren: Thanks George for the question. Clearly, volume, price and mix are all important elements as we think about our business. And clearly, we're fortunate to be participating in an industry that is continuing to grow, both through innovation but also through demand, and the combination of those factors make us positive about our outlook. We are excited to be in health care and excited about our position in it and our focus on pharmaceuticals we think is an important one. I think that the biggest change that we've talked about today and even Britt was talking about it related to the third quarter is the evolving mix of our business. And these higher-priced, more specialty products that we believe deliver tremendous value and frankly, take cost out of the health care system, do have a negative mix or margin experience on us as we think about our overall P&L. And so what we've been attempting to do and been very successful at it as we find these five categories of pricing is to position our value proposition to the customers in such a way that they're – we're getting properly paid for the service we provide and that our business is evolving. Our business strategy and our business financials are appropriately evolving as our mix evolves. And that's probably the biggest change you'll see this continued mix shift towards specialty products.
George Hill: Okay. And then I guess just a quick follow-up then. I guess just one last one on generics would be, as we think of the profit pool that's generated off of the sales of generic drugs, is that profit pool generally concentrated in a smaller number of products or even in half of the number of products? Or is it more broad-based? And I'm just thinking about this in comparison to when we saw profits concentrated in a smaller number of profits from the period of generic drug price inflation.
John Hammergren: Well, I think that the – you all have access to the data that tells you which molecules are selling with greater volumes, and you also have pricing data not from us, but from an industry perspective, so you can kind of volume weight the mix of the industry and get some kind of overall view of where the dollars are spent. As it relates to the margin effect on the company like McKesson, that's difficult to discuss, given that there – that some of these molecules, even though they might be big and dollars, may have many, many competitors and, therefore, the profit opportunities may be reduced because of the competitive activities associated with those molecules. But I think we continue to see the generic market as attractive to us. Our position is very strong, and we're continuing to grow our portfolio of generics, not just in line with the market, but in some cases, we further penetrate our existing customers by taking on more and more of their generic sourcing and spend requirements. And so when Britt talks about the success of ClarusONE, part of the – of our value is taking our scale into the marketplace with all of our customers and giving them an affordable alternative to buying from some of these telemarketers and others that may have chipped away at our overall share position. And then, obviously, the launch cycle is less favorable today than – in terms of new products than it might have been a year ago. I think we have time for one last question.
Operator: We will now take our final question from Charles Rhyee from Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Charles Rhyee: Yes, hi. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess most of my question has been asked. Maybe, Britt, on Change Healthcare, you made a comment contribution was down sequentially, and you said there was some issues in the imaging business. You called out a deferral in purchases. Does that mean we would expect those to come back in the next quarter, or maybe give us more thoughts on – inside on what's going on the part of the business and what we kind of expect even beyond just the updated contribution? Thanks.
John Hammergren: Well, thanks for the question Charles. This is John I’m probably going to help Britt on this one given that he's pretty new to the team's health care activity, and we've just recently put him on the Board to replace James. We've had the imaging business inside McKesson for a long time. It's a great, great business with a very large franchise and a great market position and really a competitive product line. That business now is a, in whole, part of Change Health are and so our visibility to it has been reduced to some extent, given that we don't manage that business directly. It's managed by the Change Healthcare executive team. But I do – obviously, the McKesson people that are there, we talk frequently. And I would say that the biggest thing that we've seen is a change in the purchase cycle of our customers, and we would have expected them to continue to be buying new equipment and up – and refreshing their imaging work, and that usually provides us an opportunity to win the software that goes along with it than what we've seen is that – is significantly flatter market than we would have anticipated in the replacement cycle for some of this equipment, and, therefore, we see a flatness in our revenues in our imaging business. So, I think it's really driven more by market characteristics related to the use of capital by our largest customers and that capital being either not deployed at all or deployed in other areas. Having said that, we believe a lot of this imaging equipment is going to have to be replaced. It's just not contemporary any longer and when that replacement cycle comes back, the Change Healthcare imaging business, we believe, will begin to grow nicely again with its leadership position.
John Hammergren: So, it's time for us to end this call. I want to thank you, Cecilia, for this work as an operator, and I want to thank all of you on the call today. I also want to thank our employees for their dedication to our customers and partners in line with our eyecare value of putting the customers first in all that we do. To underline this point, McKesson is once again ranked number one in our industry by Fortune Magazine in its 2018 World's Most Admired Companies survey. This annual survey measures corporate reputation and performance against several key attributes. While we are honored to be recognized for the second year in a row with this award, I'm deeply humbled by the work of our more than 75,000 employees whose unwavering focus on our customers will ensure our continued success as we move forward. In closing, I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us. McKesson continues to execute against our fiscal 2018 plan, and we look forward to updating you with our fiscal 2019 outlook when we provide our fourth quarter's earnings results in May. Thank you, and goodbye.
Operator: Thank you for joining today’s conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the McKesson Second Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Craig Mercer. Please go ahead, sir.
Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.: Thank you, Jessica. Good morning and welcome to the McKesson fiscal 2018 second quarter earnings call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update, and then James will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour, at 9:00 AM Eastern Time. Before we begin, I'll remind listeners that during the course of this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, John and James will reference adjusted earnings, adjusted operating profit margin excluding non-controlling interests, and items excluding foreign currency exchange effects. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information for investors with regard to the company's operating performance, and comparability of financial results period-over-period. Please refer to our press release announcing second quarter fiscal 2018 results for further information, and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thank you, and here's John Hammergren.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thanks, Craig, and thanks everyone for joining us on our call. Today, we reported solid operational performance across our business as we make continued progress towards a strong finish to our fiscal 2018. For the second quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $52 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.28, and we are reiterating our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings range of $11.80 to $12.50 per diluted share. Before I dive into the details of the quarter, let me briefly touch upon today's announcement that Paul Julian will be retiring at the end of the calendar year. I'd like to acknowledge the tremendous contributions by Paul over the past two decades. Paul's business acumen and strategic leadership have helped us expand our market reach as well as the breadth of services and solutions we offer to our customers. His dedication and tireless commitment to our people, our customers and the industry set him apart. Starting in McKesson Health Systems, the company's distribution business for hospitals, he led many of the businesses that now comprise our Distribution Solutions segment. Paul has had a four decade career in healthcare. He has received numerous awards and throughout his career have been recognized for his many contributions. He has demonstrated exceptional character, accomplishment and leadership in the industry and in the community. I worked closely with Paul for many years and he is my friend as well as a close colleague. His perspective and insights are critical to the growth and success of McKesson, including building a deep bench of talented leaders to carry McKesson into the future. On Paul's retirement, the presidents of these businesses within Distribution Solutions will report to me. I will miss working with Paul and wish him the very best in this new chapter of his life. Turning now to our business results, our North American pharmaceutical distribution and services businesses, which include U.S. Pharmaceutical, McKesson Specialty Health, McKesson Canada and our recently formed McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions business, had year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of 5% on a constant currency basis. I'd like to discuss a few highlights in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. We are recognized as a leader in delivering novel solutions to the market. We find innovative ways to expand our value proposition across the entire supply chain. For example, AccessHealth continues to successfully partner with independent pharmacies, enabling improved financial performance and broadening access to narrow patient/payer networks. We also recently closed the BDI Pharma acquisition. This business complements our existing plasma offerings and allows us to expand plasma and biologic distribution into specialty pharmacy and homecare with differentiated expertise. And ClarusONE, which is performing in line with our plan, leverages our scale and our unique in-house sourcing capabilities. These examples demonstrate our ongoing strategy to build scale, expand our pharmaceutical offerings, enhance our manufacturer value proposition, and enable our customers' continued success. Next, we're pleased with the progress of our multiyear initiative to implement differential pricing for brand, generic, specialty, biosimilar and OTC drug classes as we work through our contract renewal cycles. Finally, Walgreens' asset purchase of a number of Rite Aid stores was approved by the FTC last month. Based on Walgreens' public statements that they began last week to transition stores and will carry through the spring of 2018, we expect to be impacted in our fourth quarter as stores progressively migrate to Walgreens over the transition period. We've been having constructive dialog with Rite Aid on how we can continue to support their success, during the transition period and beyond to the mutual benefit of both parties. And as I've mentioned in the past, Rite Aid has only a modest impact on our P&L. We are comfortable that our sourcing scale and capability will not be impacted by this transition. Turning now to McKesson Specialty Health, with the closing of the intraFUSION acquisition earlier this quarter, along with the BDI Pharma acquisition I spoke about a moment ago, I'd like to highlight how we continue to enhance our specialty capabilities across the organization. We provide manufacturers with an integrated solution set starting from clinical research and development to drug launch and distribution services, and from patient reimbursement and access solutions to real world evidence-based capabilities. Biologics and biosimilars continue to represent an emerging opportunity for the industry. We are proud to be a leader, supporting clinical trials for these and other innovative new therapies for many years. And I'm excited about the opportunity that CoverMyMeds provides across our businesses with the e-Referral platform for specialty prescriptions, connecting providers with specialty pharmacies and payers and improving care coordination and care management for complex health conditions. I'll move next to our Canadian business, where we saw a nice growth in the quarter with constant currency results that were in line with our expectations. During the quarter, McKesson Canada closed the Uniprix banner acquisition, where we will continue to offer Uniprix owners retail banner management expertise and best-in-class supply chain network, designed to ensure patient safety and reduced costs. All of these services help strengthen independent pharmacies. Uniprix integration activities are progressing well as are those supporting the GMD Distribution acquisition. And our McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions business continues to make progress on the CoverMyMeds integration. We are encouraged by the level of collaboration we are already seeing between CoverMyMeds and our other businesses. Turning now to our results for international pharmaceutical distribution and services, on our last earnings call, we mentioned that recently announced reimbursement cuts in the UK were in excess of historic levels and also greater than what we planned for in fiscal 2018. After studying the nature of the cuts, we decided it was necessary to take action to position the business for sustained long-term growth by initiating a plan to rationalize our store footprint and streamline our back-office operations. As a result, we recorded certain charges within our UK retail operations. James will provide more detail on these items. We see our global retail presence as a way to stem the tide of growing healthcare costs as we anticipate more services migrating from higher-cost locations into the lower-cost pharmacy setting. And we believe that pharmacist plays an important role in providing the range of healthcare services. And finally, our Medical-Surgical business continues to deliver consistent results, benefiting from the shift of care to lower-cost sites. In summary, I was pleased with how with our Distribution Solutions segment performed in the quarter. Turning now to our Technology Solutions segment, we reached another milestone on October 2 with the sale of our Enterprise Information Solutions or EIS business. This represents another important step in the strategic shift to realign our business focus on Distribution Solutions, following the creation of Change Healthcare earlier this calendar year, is a testament to the team at EIS when we consider the results they achieved for the first half of the year, given the uncertainties around the extended strategic review process that is now complete. In addition, I have confidence that EIS customers have a partner committed to their success. And for Change Healthcare, we continue to see encouraging progress against the execution of the business case and the realization of the anticipated cost synergies. And to summarize, McKesson's fiscal second quarter results represent solid execution across the enterprise, and we are reiterating our adjusted earnings range of $11.80 to $12.50 per diluted share for our full year fiscal 2018 outlook. We are extremely well-positioned to execute our portfolio approach to capital deployment and deliver value for our shareholders through a mix of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases, and dividends. Before I hand the call over to James, I'd like to spend a moment on a topic of national importance, the opioid epidemic. This is a crisis that has touched many Americans, and including many Americans that live here at McKesson and are part of our family. McKesson takes our role in the supply chain very seriously. We've invested considerable time and resources to help stop diversion at a time when diversion tactics are constantly changing. We've implemented sophisticated analytic tools, hired experienced diversion investigators, and enhanced the effectiveness of our controlled substance monitoring program. We work collaboratively with the DEA to better understand diversion trends. This working relationship is critical, since the DEA has singular line of sight into the total volume of opioids sold to any licensed pharmacy or hospital. The trends in this crisis continue to evolve, and we are regularly enhancing our programs to further limit the misuse and abuse of prescription opioids while simultaneously protecting the availability of the appropriate treatments for patients with serious illnesses and injuries. But our company's, and our industry's, commitment to public health and safety was recently called into question by certain media outlets. Those outlets sought to place blame for the tragic opioid epidemic on distributors and elected officials who, with bipartisan Congressional support and after consultation and input from the DEA and the Department of Justice, enacted a clarifying enforcement bill that was signed into law. As recent Congressional testimony indicated, since the passage of the law, the quantity of opioids distributed has decreased, and the number of enforcement actions by the DEA has increased. Many press articles have since corrected the misinformation that resulted from those earlier media stories and subsequently, there has also been more attention put on the need to control the annual production of opioids, on the illicit opioids entering our country from other sources, and on the critical role of healthcare professionals who are at the frontlines in dealing with patients and ensuring that only patients with legitimate medical needs receive the appropriate amount of these medications. McKesson is also committed to helping promote forward-looking solutions to this public health problem. That's why over a year ago, we convened a taskforce of policy and clinical experts to help create a public policy white paper, which outlined a set of proposals to help combat the epidemic going forward. These proposals include changing the medical community's approach to prescribing opioids, requiring e-prescribing to avoid modification or manipulation of the prescription. It created a national patient safety network that provides real-time patient information to pharmacists while they're directly interacting with the patients seeking these drugs. We look forward to continuing to work with all parties; federal, state and local governments, manufacturers, insurance companies, pharmacies, and the medical profession, to implement practical and effective solutions. And last, let me touch upon the tragedies that recently unfolded across the U.S. and Puerto Rico. McKesson was fortunate to have avoided material impacts to our operations or to our facilities from the devastation resulting from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and the recent fires across Northern California. We are proud to have played a role in the emergency efforts, providing pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to the affected areas. Our employees in the McKesson Foundation have been extremely generous with their support for displaced coworkers and other residents, contributing more than $700,000 in relief efforts. We continue to aid in the recovery of our affected employees, customers, and communities. With that, I'll turn the call over to James and will return to address your questions when he finishes. James?
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported second quarter adjusted EPS of $3.28, which was slightly better than our previous expectations, and we are reiterating our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings outlook of $11.80 to $12.50 per diluted share. Unless stated otherwise, the underlying assumptions that were detailed in our fourth quarter fiscal 2017 press release, and on our first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call, are being reiterated today. I will talk in more detail about our outlook, but first let's review our results fourth quarter. GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations equated to $0.01 for the second quarter. These earnings include impairment and restructuring charges of $2.60 per diluted share related to our retail pharmacy business in the UK. As we discussed on our last earnings call in July, the UK government announced additional reimbursement cuts, which were incremental to their more typical annual reimbursement reductions and to those assumed in our plan. Primarily as a result of these cuts, we have identified and started to implement initiatives to partially offset the impact of these cuts, which include approximately 190 store closures and divestitures. The resulting savings from this program are expected to more meaningfully benefit our fiscal 2019 performance. The program's total asset impairment and restructuring charges are expected to be between $650 million and $750 million. Specific to the second quarter, we recorded goodwill and other long-lived asset impairment and restructuring pre-tax charges totaling $586 million. As a reminder, these charges will impact our GAAP financial results. However, they will be excluded from adjusted earnings. Now let's turn to our second quarter adjusted earnings, which exclude the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments, LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring charges, and other adjustments. Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedules 2 and 3. Consolidated revenues for the second quarter increased 4% in constant currency year-over-year. Second quarter adjusted gross profit was up 2% in constant currency from a year ago, and second quarter adjusted operating expenses increased 6% in constant currency year-over-year. Adjusted other income was $27 million for the quarter, an increase of 8% in constant currency. Adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was $75 million for the second quarter. We are encouraged by the progress of Change Healthcare and continue to expect our adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare joint venture will be between $250 million and $310 million in McKesson's fiscal 2018 P&L. Interest expense of $69 million decreased 12% in constant currency for the quarter, driven primarily by the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates. Our adjusted tax rate was 23.6% for the quarter, driven by our mix of business. Our full year tax rate for McKesson is now estimated to be approximately 24%, down from our previous estimate of 25%, reflecting our mix of business. Our income attributable to non-controlling interest, or NCI, was $55 million for the quarter, an increase of 218% in constant currency. As a reminder, the increase in NCI year-over-year is primarily driven by fee income from ClarusONE, a joint sourcing entity with Walmart. We now expect income attributable to non-controlling interests to be between $210 million and $230 million in fiscal 2018, reflecting ClarusONE's ongoing success at sourcing generics at prices lower than we originally expected. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations totaled $689 million with our second quarter adjusted EPS at $3.28 per diluted share, up 11% compared to $2.96 in the prior year. Our second quarter EPS growth was driven by organic growth across multiple business units, including ClarusONE, a lower share count and incremental profit contribution from acquisitions, which more than offset the year-over-year lapping effect of increased price competition in our independent pharmacy business in fiscal 2017 and the impact of reduced reimbursement in our UK retail pharmacy business. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 210 million, down 8% compared to the prior-year period. Let's now turn to the segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3. Distribution Solutions segment revenues were $51.9 billion. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 5% year-over-year. Reported revenues benefited from $344 million in favorable currency rate movements. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 5% in constant currency, driven by market growth and acquisitions, partially offset by brand-to-generic conversions. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6.8 billion for the quarter. On a constant-currency basis, revenues were up 4%, driven by acquisitions and market growth. Reported revenues benefited from $237 million in favorable currency rate movements. As a reminder, our previous full year assumption was that foreign currency exchange rate movements would have a net unfavorable impact of up to $0.05 per diluted share year-over-year. During the quarter, foreign currency rates trended favorably versus our original assumptions. As a result, we now expect foreign currency exchange rate movements will have a net favorable impact of approximately $0.10 for the year. Moving now to the Medical-Surgical business, revenues were up 2% for the second quarter, driven by market growth. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit was up 15% on a constant currency basis for the quarter, driven by acquisitions, organic growth across multiple business units, including strategic sourcing benefits from ClarusONE and increased branded compensation, more than offsetting the planned year-over-year lapping effect of increased competition in our independent pharmacy business in fiscal 2017 and the impact of reduced reimbursement in our UK retail pharmacy business. As we discussed previously, following the close of the second quarter, we have now fully lapped the impact of increased competition in our independent pharmacy business and the sell-side pricing environment continues to remain competitive with less pricing variability. Now, let me turn to branded compensation and branded pharmaceutical price increases. As noted on our first quarter earnings call, based on our previously discussed differential pricing effort, we renewed contracts with two large branded manufacturers during the first quarter. These renewals drove lower compensation in the first quarter and a resulting step-up in compensation in the second quarter. Additionally, in the second quarter, we also benefited from a pull forward of certain branded compensation that we had expected in the third quarter. That said, our expectations for the full year contribution from branded compensation remain unchanged. I'd like to remind everyone, however, as is typical based on our historical experience, that the majority of manufacturer pricing activity is expected to occur in our fiscal fourth quarter. Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating expenses increased 18% on a constant-currency basis for the quarter. Segment operating expenses reflect an increase driven by acquisitions and the increased mix of retail business in the segment, partially offset by our ongoing cost management efforts. Going forward, we expect our full year adjusted operating expenses as a percent of revenue to be at levels roughly consistent with the first half of this year. As we diversify our Distribution Solutions businesses, our adjusted gross profit margin rate benefits from our recent retail pharmacy and technology acquisitions. Similarly, these acquisitions are increasing our adjusted operating expenses as a percent of revenue. Now, to our adjusted operating profit. Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating profit was up 12% in constant currency year-over-year, at $1 billion. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 201 basis points on a constant currency basis, an increase of 13 basis points driven by the same factors as previously discussed, partially offset by our customer and product mix, including the growth of higher-priced specialty pharmaceuticals. As a result of this revenue mix and the pressures on our UK business, we now expect our full year Distribution Solutions' adjusted operating margin rate to be at the lower half of our previously guided range of 198 basis points to 208 basis points. Now, moving to Technology Solutions, as a reminder, in fiscal 2018, MTS segment revenues, adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating expenses contain only the results of our Enterprise Information Solutions business, or EIS. Revenues were $120 million, while adjusted segment gross profit was $60 million. Adjusted segment operating expenses were $44 million and adjusted operating profit, excluding the equity contribution from Change Healthcare, was $17 million. Additionally, following the close of the quarter, we completed the sale of our EIS business. As a result, there will be no contribution from this business in the second half of fiscal 2018. As a result, going forward, MTS operating profit will represent only the equity contribution from Change Healthcare. I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding increased 1 day from the prior year to 27 days. Our days sales in inventory increased 2 day from the prior year to 31 days, and our days sales in payables increased 2 days from the prior year to 61 days. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.6 billion with approximately $1.9 billion held offshore. And in the first six months of fiscal 2018, McKesson generated $1.3 billion in cash flow from operations. We continue to deploy capital in line with our portfolio approach. In the first six months of fiscal 2018, we spent $255 million on internal capital investments and repaid $545 million in the long-term debt. In the second quarter, we repurchased $400 million in common stock. The FY 2018 EPS impact of this buyback approximately offsets the loss of EIS' earnings in the back half of this fiscal year. Share repurchases during the first six months of fiscal 2018 now totaled $650 million. And we now expect our weighted average diluted shares to be approximately 211 million for the full year, reflecting share repurchases completed in fiscal 2018. We have approximately $2.1 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We spent $1.9 billion on acquisitions during the first six months of fiscal 2018, which includes the second quarter acquisitions of intraFUSION, BDI Pharma and Uniprix, all of which we discussed at Investor Day. And yesterday, the Board of Directors approved the next quarterly dividend of $0.34. Now, let me briefly touch on Rite Aid. Our original guidance range assumed a full year revenue contribution from Rite Aid of approximately $13 billion and an estimated annual adjusted earnings per share contribution of between $0.20 and $0.40. We also noted that should Rite Aid be acquired by Walgreens, we would expect a material one-time cash flow impact driven by the favorable working capital terms associated with our generics business. In September, Walgreens announced it had received regulatory clearance to purchase approximately 40% of Rite Aid stores and that some store transitions would begin this month and all impacted stores would be a part of Walgreens operations by the spring of 2018. We will keep you updated on the earnings and cash flow impact of the eventual store transition program during the next two quarters. While our relationship with Rite Aid will be smaller going forward, the performance of ClarusONE continues to illustrate the competitiveness of our global sourcing scale and operations. Now, let me provide more detail on our fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS outlook. We are reiterating our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of $11.80 to $12.50 per diluted share. This reiterated range includes the earnings headwinds of the recently completed sale of our EIS business, an estimate of the effect of the Rite Aid store transition and our projection of the challenges expected in the UK during the remainder of FY 2018. Offsetting these headwinds, our guidance range benefits from share repurchases completed in the second quarter, the anticipated favorability to results driven by foreign currency exchange rate movements, and the new estimated adjusted tax rate of approximately 24%. The various items that I've just mentioned largely offset one another, resulting in our reiteration of the previously-guided range. Each year, as we develop our annual plan, we contemplate a range of possible outcomes. Based on our performance year-to-date, I continue to be comfortable with the midpoint represented by our full year guide. As for our quarterly progression, let me remind you of my earlier comments regarding the pull forward of branded compensation that we had originally expected in the third quarter. And, as in most previous years, we expect our fourth quarter to be our largest in terms of EPS contribution in the fiscal year. In closing, our second quarter results were somewhat ahead of our expectations, driven by timing. And I'm pleased to be able to reiterate our full year guide in the face of the sale of EIS, the transition of the Rite Aid stores, and the UK headwinds. And as a reminder, our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of $11.80 to $12.50 per diluted share excludes the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles of $2.40 to $2.70 per diluted share, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments of $0.90 to $1.10 per diluted share, LIFO inventory-related charges of $0.20 to credits of $0.10 per diluted share, gains from antitrust legal settlements of up to $0.10 per diluted share, restructuring charges of $1.10 to $1.40 per diluted share, and other net charges of $1.40 to $1.60 per diluted share. Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Jessica?
Operator: Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. And we'll first go to Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for the question. James, lot of moving parts, but wanted to make sure I understood what was factored into the full year guidance today versus the previous update. So just, is it correct to assume that guidance now contemplates roughly an additional $30 million from additional UK reimbursement cuts that weren't in the previous guidance? And then, with the EIS divestiture or sale intra-quarter, is that about $35 million that you're absorbing into the full year range that's unchanged? Are those the two biggest new things that we should be thinking about in the full year guidance range?
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Well, in terms of the three headwinds UK, EIS, and Rite Aid, so in the UK, I would say the figure is higher than what you were mentioning there. So, we'll update you as time goes by. With EIS, as I mentioned, feel as though the EPS impact in FY 2018 of the buyback roughly offsets what we would have benefited from EIS in our back half of the year. And for Rite Aid, you can think about the original guide that we put out of $0.20 to $0.40, effectively, we're going to have about a 10% effect of that in the balance of the fiscal year. So, hopefully that helps give you a little bit of direction around that.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: No, it does. I guess just ultimately trying to get a better sense that, there really was not a change to the core drug distribution outlook then, as we think about the previous update relative to this update? Is that a fair statement?
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: That's right, because, again, the three items, the UK, the EIS, and Rite Aid, obviously, two of those are embedded within the Distribution Solutions business. Those are, in essence, being offset by share count, tax rate, and FX assumptions.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And then just, John, a quick follow-up, two significant management departures announced this week. Can you talk about the process, as you think about backfilling, big shoes to fill, with Paul and Mark's departures announced this week?
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Sure. As you might expect, the management team and the board have a very rigorous process of, not only talent development and talent review and sort of talent planning, but also a lot of work is done, particularly at the higher levels, in terms of succession planning. So yeah, Paul and I have worked together for an awfully long time, and one of the priorities we've had together for that entire tenure together has been the development of a very strong bench. We announced very quickly a replacement for Mark Walchirk upon his departure, and we're really pleased at, not only the contribution he's made to us over his career, but the fact that he landed in an important job, and it shows that McKesson executives are sought after and that they're well-trained and that they can take on big responsibilities. So, I think that's the good part of that news for him certainly, and we're excited that we are able to replace him, in the new combined responsibility for both our U.S. Pharmaceutical business and our Specialty business, with Nick Loporcaro. You probably met Nick on occasion on our Investor Days. Nick runs our Specialty business now, and will also have the combined responsibility for our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. And frankly, I think Nick is very well-suited for this job. He ran all of our Canadian distribution and operations businesses in Canada. He knows retail pharmacy well. He knows hospital pharmacy. He knows independence and chains. He understands the manufacturing environment. He certainly understands what we think is a significant going-forward opportunity in Specialty. So, we're excited about his leadership and what he can do for us. And as I said, it's not as if Paul was going to be here forever and we've been always thinking about how are we going to make sure that we're well positioned in the event that he decides to pursue retirement. So, I'm excited for Paul, excited for Mark and especially excited for Nick.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for that.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Yeah.
Operator: And we'll now go to Charles Rhyee from Cowen & Company.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just to follow up on the cadence in the guidance. So James, is there any – you talked about the pull forward – I'm sorry, the step up in 2Q from the manufacturer contracts. Are there any kind of step-downs in the back half of the year that we should be aware of?
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Well, I would say, as you think about the progression of Q3 and Q4 and the relative contribution of those quarter to the full year, I would see Q4 generating a number of percentage points more than Q3 will. And, indeed, I commented on that, that trend pull forward into Q2 from Q3. So, I think that, hopefully, helps a little bit on the sequencing of the quarter.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. That does. And then, John, you talked about moving into differential pricing. Can you comment on the progress that you've seen so far? And particularly, are you seeing any kind of pushback from clients, maybe from some of your larger ones? And maybe can you help characterize what those discussions look like? Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thanks for the question, Charles. We have been in a consistent process with our renewals of our agreements with our customers and I think we've been quite successful. Our customer base understands that the pricing that we used 20 years ago, which were basically a brand and generic and even mostly brand if you go back that far, just doesn't work in today's environment. And having a more specific approach to pricing categories of products that are more similar to one another, we think, is better for us and, frankly, better for them as well. You're not mixing discounts between different types of products and different revenue and margin characteristics, and this provides better clarity for both of us. So, I think we've been almost universally successful in getting this accomplished, and we feel confident we will continue to do so as we finish this contract renewal cycle over the next several years.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll now move to George Hill from RBC.
George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yeah. Hey. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions, and if Paul is listening, I want to wish him well, John, because I know he served you a long time. I guess, James, I would ask, is there any chance that you can quantify kind of the impact of ClarusONE and the brand drug pull forward in the quarter? And should we think of the brand drug impact is not repeatable in Q3, but ClarusONE should be a more sustainable contribution? Like, I'm just trying to make sure I have a good understanding of the cadence of the balance of the year.
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yeah in terms of the branded compensation, as I mentioned, where – we do have these timing elements from Q1 to Q2, Q3 into Q2, but for the overall year, we're not expecting a change in the branded comp that we would receive. In terms of ClarusONE and their work around the generics, we've been very pleased with how that has proceeded. I mentioned in my remarks that the NCI line reflects the progress that ClarusONE has been making at sourcing pharmaceutical at lower prices than we had expected at the outset of the year. So, our COGS are benefiting, our Walmart's colleagues COGS are benefiting from the progress that ClarusONE is making.
George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Then maybe my follow-up would just be a little bit nuanced. Is that the – the outperformance in the quarter, I guess, versus consensus expectations was pretty strong. Should we think of that largely as the timing of the brand contribution verses maybe what the Street might have been expecting for the year?
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yeah, that's certainly one driver of it. Obviously, tax rates has come down as well. We've updated our full year guide in that regard. And I did note that Q2's results were slightly ahead of where we had planned to be originally at the start of the year.
George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you.
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.
Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hi. Good morning and congrats on a very good quarter. So, two questions. First, John, for you. We're hearing, obviously, a lot of discussion and getting a lot of questions on Amazon. Can you just share with us your thoughts? And also, do you see opportunity for you guys to work together with Amazon if they were to enter the drug supply chain?
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thanks for the question, Ricky. To some extent, we were Amazon before it was cool to be Amazon. Now, if you think about our business model, largely it is an online order relationship. From an order processing perspective, it is very well functioning that has been in place for a long time, next-day delivery and a complete process from a logistics perspective. But it's also supported by field salespeople, return goods management, sometimes private trucking, and certainly things like controlled substance management, billions of dollars of inventory, and very significant back-office operations that reconcile the significant delta in various pricing strategies that are our manufacturer partners, both in medical supplies as well as in pharmaceuticals, rely upon with us in partnership. So, I would say, in some ways, it's very similar to what Amazon would do maybe logistically. But if you actually think about what's behind the scenes in terms of us taking credit risk, in terms of us processing invoices and processing returns, and then processing pricing on a regular basis, it's quite significant and more nuanced, perhaps, than it would appear on the surface. Clearly, we are also heavily focused on trying to make sure that our customers have the right tools and capabilities to help them with all of their – particularly in the independent side with all of their requirements in terms of patient relationships to make it more than just a transaction and make it a healthcare experience supported by a professional pharmacist that really understands the nuances of drug-to-drug interaction, understands what it means to dispense things like opioids and other products, and understands certainly the regulatory framework and the larger clinical issues that may be facing the patients that they're working with everyday. So, the easiest thing to talk about in the world of wholesaling is the logistics function. But I would say that that's probably the simplest part of our business. And clearly, we try to excel in myriad of other areas that we think differentiate us. Having said all of that, we don't take the entry of any competitor lightly and we continue to evolve our strategy so that our value to both the manufacturer and to our customers is unique and superior.
Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you for that. And then, just a follow-up question in terms of the guide and the progression. So, you've tightened the range on your LIFO credits. So, what are you seeing in terms of the deflationary environment? How do you think about the progression for the second half of your fiscal year? And then also, how should we think about that in the context of your Distribution operating margin goals for the fiscal year?
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Well, in terms of generic deflation, as we've discussed before, ClarusONE is doing an excellent job. We're purchasing pharmaceuticals at lower prices than we'd expected when we first put the plan together. Now, again, as we've discussed, that equation of optimizing our cost of goods sold is quite separate to the economic equation on the sell side, where I mentioned in my prepared remarks that, suddenly, the environment is still competitive, but with less pricing volatility than we would have been looking at this time last year. In terms of our Distribution Solutions operating margin guide, I felt appropriate to really direct you to the lower half of that original guided range, based on the UK situation that we've been discussing at some length. And then, of course, there'll be some effect on the P&L that will impact the Distribution Solutions operating margin from Rite Aid as well as those stores transition at a yet-to-be-determined rate.
Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: We will now go to Lisa Gill from JPMorgan.
Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much. I also want to add my congratulations to Paul on his retirement and we'll definitely miss him, John. First, just trying to reconcile a number of the statements that have been said today. James, you just talked about sell-side pressure continuing being less volatile, you talked about the benefit to COGS on ClarusONE. Is the expectation, as we move throughout the rest of the fiscal year, that you have to share some of that ClarusONE savings back with customers? I'm just trying to understand how do we think about ClarusONE, specifically, as we're thinking about the cadence of the quarter?
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, I think the best way to think about it, as James mentioned a moment ago, is really in two distinct buckets. Our ability to manage our costs across the board are an important aspect of what we do, whether it's a cost of our operations and the productivity improvements we get or whether it's a cost of the goods we purchase, driving those costs down to market levels or below should be our priority, and our focus has always been to buy right and to manage right and to be efficient. The second priority is to make sure that our customers are getting the deal that they need to continue to be competitive in the marketplace. And largely, that's determined on what the market price is for products. So, we have a completely separate team that decides what we're going to sell products for from what the team is that does the buying of our activity. And we're focused on making sure that we have the right data on both sides of those operations to assure ourselves of market competitiveness, and that's what we're attempting to do and that's where the margin comes from is our ability to manage those operations with, hopefully, solid execution. So that's the way we think about it. So, the more we overachieve the ClarusONE and the more stable the market can be, then more likely it is for us to get margin expansion over time to grow our business, and that should be our priority for it (50:21) to create value.
Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, John, you did mention in your prepared comments, talking about the opioid issue in the U.S. and talking about these media reports, over the last several years, the drug distributors have had several settlements around DEA issues, et cetera. Can you maybe just talk about what your anticipation is around opioids? Would you expect that there will be some cash flow impact, we'll see incremental settlements? Or do you think that that's largely behind you at this point and this is more of a regulatory issue rather than the states coming back to the drug distributors looking for some kind of settlement?
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, in a larger context, not even speaking necessarily about this particular issue, when you're faced with litigation or litigation risk, you usually find opportunities to try to determine whether or not there's any real risk there or any data that would support the alleged activity or risk that you may be facing. And you trade that off against what would it cost for us to not – to eliminate that risk, and the associated potential liability of that (51:37) if you're not successful. So, I think all of those decisions are made on their own and probably in isolation from one another. Are we concerned about opioid and the continued risk and things that are going on in the marketplace? Certainly, but we're probably more focused – as I tried to mention in my conversation at the beginning here, we're more focused on solutions that we think can make a difference. Frankly, lawsuits from various parties and settlements don't solve the problem. What solves the problem is thinking in a broader context and putting the solutions in place that can actually prevent this from happening. And when I mentioned physicians at the start of this, it really is related to how they think about the prescriptions they're providing to their patients and the quantities that they're writing in those scripts. Clearly, whether the script is legitimate or not when it shows up at the pharmacy, if we use electronic prescribing, that can make a difference. And third, if we have information about the patient real-time in the workflow at the pharmacy when they're doing the rest of their adjudication of the claim if they understood that the patient recently had four other scripts filled in the last two weeks from five different pharmacies across state lines, it might give them a little bit of a pause before they yet fill one more script. And that's certainly a portion of the problem and we think those solutions can be easily implemented. We think the technologies are available today and it will make a material impact, certainly on that source of the opioid diversion epidemic challenge. There's a whole other source. If you watch the news today, they talk about coming over borders. They talk about it being imported from other countries, and online ordering of these kinds of drugs that are packaged in different types of packaging to avoid detection. There's all kinds of sources of these products. And clearly, at the very start of this whole thing is, how do we help prevent people from becoming addicted to these drugs to begin with. So, it is a much larger problem. We're trying to focus on solutions. And some people ask me if this is going to be a tobacco overhang, and I don't think that's what we're going to face as an industry. Clearly, we have a role to play, but we don't see the patient. We don't prescribe the drugs. We don't dispense the drugs. We don't have all the data on the care, and I don't know how we can be responsible, solely, for this challenge.
Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I agree. I appreciate your comments.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll now go to Kevin Caliendo from Needham & Company.
Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC: Hey. Thanks for taking my call. So, another question on ClarusONE. Looking at the non-controlling interest line, it was sort of flat sequentially and for the year, your guidance implies not a significant amount of growth in that number over the course of the year. I guess my question is, is ClarusONE a growth opportunity sort of going forward, or are we sort of peaking? Is it something that can grow as we get into fiscal 2019?
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Well, I think when we talk about ClarusONE, it's important to think about the two places on our P&L where it drives the benefit. So, the first place is the cost of goods sold.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: And maybe I can jump in there, because the NCI is really not an indication of ClarusONE's opportunity and its growth. It is an accounting-related matter that James will address here in just a moment. But we see a great opportunity with ClarusONE, frankly. Today, it's focused primarily on generics. And as James mentioned, we actually overachieved our objectives, in terms of the results of our sourcing activity, and it's being reflected in our cost of goods. And obviously, we're pleased with that. But beyond just generics, and beyond just generics in the U.S., we think ClarusONE can grow. Walmart is very satisfied with what we've done thus far, and our ability to expand into other product categories and other geographies in partnership with Walmart, we think, will be continued opportunities for us to grow the ClarusONE relationship and thus, the impact on ClarusONE's cost of goods into our businesses and other categories. And that may or may not affect the NCI line. The NCI is really an artifact of the current construct of the generic relationships we have and the JV partnership that we have. And it's an output, basically, from that relationship, as opposed to something else will be put into this category, OTCs or something else, may not have an NCI component to them.
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: So, think of the cost of goods sold line as the line that receives the primary benefit from the work of ClarusONE, then the NCI line is – as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it's fee income. So, think of that as the fees earned by ClarusONE, which is a contracting entity, in many ways. And so again, in the text, I mentioned that the future guide for the NCI line is really underpinned by the fact that, as ClarusONE continues to have more success than we originally planned for in its sourcing capabilities, then there'd be a lesser level of fee income enjoyed by ClarusONE. So, I think that's an important distinction to make between COGS and the NCI line, and then focusing on the NCI line as fee income from a contracting outfit.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: And there are other things in NCI that aren't related to ClarusONE at all.
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yeah, yeah. There are multiple other drivers in the NCI line. So, those can drive volatility in any one particular quarter.
Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC: That's incredibly helpful. One just quick follow-up. You spent about $1.9 billion in acquisitions. You've highlighted them to us already. Is there any potential impact from these acquisitions in the second half of this year, or will the benefits be mostly a fiscal 2019 type of event?
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, I think it's most likely going to fall into FY 2019. We contemplated the closure of some of these acquisitions as we provided the original guidance, and we knew that certain of these transactions were going to close. But I don't think they'll have any material impact on our FY 2018 guidance. And whatever impact we do anticipate is embedded in our reaffirmation of that guidance today.
Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, guys, so much.
Operator: We will now go to Eric Coldwell from Baird. Eric, your line is open Hearing no response, we'll move to Erin Wright from Credit Suisse.
Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thanks. A follow-up to the last question, I guess, can you give us an update on the performance and where we stand with some of the potential synergies and contributions from some of the recent acquisitions, like CoverMyMeds and Rexall and Biologics? And can you also speak to maybe the profit profile of some of the more recent acquisitions that you've done? Thanks.
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. I'd say that our approach to the integrations of those various transactions that you note are going along nicely. We're hitting our synergy cases and so forth. So no, we're pleased. We feel as though those acquisitions fit very nicely with the strategies that we're pursuing across our organization. So, in terms of...
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: The margin profile...
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. That...
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: As I say, that was going to follow more aligned with the kind of businesses that they are. So, the distribution-related businesses will have more of a distribution margin and the technology businesses, like CoverMyMeds, will have a margin rate that's much higher and much similar to the rest.
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. And one further thing that I would note, going back to how we were talking about operating expenditure for the full year, multiple of those transactions, those acquisitions fall into either the retail arena or the technology arena. And in those types of businesses, you tend to have more operating expenditures as a percent of revenue than would be the norm for our traditional business.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: That's in the OpEx line.
Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Great. And then, I guess, a follow-up to that one as well. I mean, as you think about your capital deployment strategy and the priorities there in terms of acquisitions, I guess, do you see sort of a healthy pipeline out there, opportunities potentially in tangential businesses? And what sort of annual deal spend are – do you continue to expect at this point? Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: It's probably difficult to speculate on what the annual deal spent would be. I think what's best for us to sort of reaffirm here is that we do prefer M&A. But as you know, we do this in a portfolio way. We're not afraid to do share repurchases. We talked about our share repurchases in the quarter and we clearly talked about our dividend again in this press release and we talked about M&A. The critical thing, from my perspective, is that the M&A has to make financial sense. And we focus on our long-term cost of capital and making sure that these acquisitions come in well above our cost of capital and that we get the kind of returns that are appropriate on these investments. And the answer to the other part of your question, we do have a pipeline of acquisitions that we actively work almost seemingly all the time. And sometimes, they come to be and sometimes they don't, for various reasons, but I think we're pleased there are still opportunities for us in various markets. I think we have time for one more question, Jessica.
Operator: And we'll go to John Ransom from Raymond James.
John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Oh, boy, I get to be last. That's better than nothing. So, thank you for squeezing me in. I'm sorry that was – I didn't mean that to be serious. Just one thing in our model that there seem to be a big sequential drop in depreciation from the second quarter. So, the EBIT number was better, but the EBITDA number was a little below our number. Can you provide some help on that number? Is this the new normal given some of the portfolio changes that you've made?
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Well, perhaps, one thing to note is that as we proceeded to be close to the sale of EIS to Allscripts, that transaction closed on the first day of Q3. But in terms of the way our accounting runs, we put it as held-for-sale in Q2. So, that might be one of the items that you'd want to focus on.
John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: But I mean – so you are running about, what, $27 million or something in depreciation in the third – it was (1:03:05) like a $70 million drop. I'm just asking on a go-forward basis, is this the right depreciation number for the back half of the year?
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Well, I wouldn't expect anything material in terms of the rate and pace of change in depreciation. But we can certainly follow up with you...
John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay.
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: ...John, on the specifics.
John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. Thanks so much.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: All right. Thanks, John, and...
Operator: And that is all the time we have for questions today. I'll turn the conference back over to our presenters.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thanks, Jessica, and thanks to all of you on the call for your time today. I also certainly want to, once again, say thanks to Paul Julian for nearly 25 years of friendship and 21 years here at McKesson. And I'm confident that in retirement he and I are going to continue to stay close and I wish he and Michelle (1:04:00) all the best, and his family, going forward. McKesson continues to execute against our fiscal 2018 plan and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us. I want to recognize the outstanding performance of our employees and their contributions to help our customers improve lives and deliver opportunities to make better health possible as most clearly demonstrated this quarter by how we came together to provide the support to those impacted by the recent natural disasters. I'll now hand the call over to Craig to review upcoming events for the financial community. Craig?
Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.: Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events for the financial community. On November 7, we will present at the Credit Suisse Healthcare Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona. On December 5, we'll present at the Global Mizuho Investor Conference in New York City. And on December 6, we will present at the Citi 2017 Global Healthcare Conference in New York City. And on January 9th, we will present at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. We will release third quarter earnings in late July. Thank you and good bye.
Operator: And this concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the McKesson Q1 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Craig Mercer. Please go ahead.
Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.: Thank you, Anthony. Good morning and welcome to the McKesson fiscal 2018 first-quarter earnings call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update, and then James will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour, at 9:30 AM Eastern Time. Before we begin, I'll remind listeners that during the course of this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the SEC, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, John and James will reference adjusted earnings, adjusted operating profit margin excluding non-controlling interests, and items excluding foreign currency exchange effects. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information for investors with regard to the company's operating performance, and comparability of financial results period-over-period. Please refer to our press release announcing first quarter fiscal 2018 results for further information, and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thank you, and here's John Hammergren.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thanks, Craig. And thanks everyone for joining us on our call. Today we reported a solid start to fiscal 2018. For the first quarter, we achieved total company revenues in excess of $51 billion, and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.46, consistent with our expectations. Combined with our share repurchases we completed in the first quarter, we are raising our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings outlook to $11.80 to $12.50 per diluted share. Before I dive into the details of the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the progress that demonstrates our continued commitment to long-term shareholder value creation. First, we continue to proactively develop our portfolio of distribution businesses. In the past quarter, we announced the signing of three acquisitions primarily in the specialties space. We closed four acquisitions, including CoverMyMeds, in early April and we started the important work to integrate Rexall and other recent acquisitions which are beginning to contribute to our earnings growth. Each of these acquisitions that we've announced or are in the process of integrating, highlight our commitment to expand our specialty capabilities, enhance our leading technology solutions for our Distribution Solutions customers and grow our retail pharmacy footprint internationally. Second, we continue to make progress on the strategic shift to realign our businesses to focus on distribution and retail pharmacy solutions following the creation of Change Healthcare. This quarter represents the first time we include the results for our equity investment in Change Healthcare; the new company was created to deliver a broad portfolio of solutions that will help lower healthcare costs, improve patient access and outcomes, and make it simpler for payers, providers and consumers to manage the transition to value-based care. Change Healthcare is now a focused and scaled enterprise executing on this mission. Additionally, I'm encouraged by the recent developments in our pursuit of the strategic alternatives for our Enterprise Information Solutions business, and I expect we will have more to announce in the near-term. Turning now to our business results for the quarter. Our North American pharmaceutical distribution and services businesses, which include U.S. Pharmaceutical, McKesson Specialty Health, McKesson Canada, and our recently formed McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions business, had revenue growth in the first quarter of 5% on a constant currency basis. I'd like to take a moment to highlight a few matters specific to our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. Revenue in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business met our expectations in the first quarter driven by organic growth. Next I want to provide an update on the pricing environment as we've transitioned into fiscal 2018. We entered this year with an assumption of branded inflation in the mid-single-digits and our first quarter experience was slightly ahead of this assumption. Additionally, you'll recall that during fiscal 2017, we saw increased price competition in the independent retail pharmacy channel, which eventually resulted in reduced volumes from McKesson. Over time we adjusted our strategy and we were able to recapture that lost volume, retain our share, and build upon our longstanding relationships. Consistent with our update over the last two quarters, we continue to see a competitive market for selling generic pharmaceuticals in the U.S., albeit, with less pricing variability. We expect to lap the independent pharmacy sell-side pricing impact by the end of our fiscal 2018 second quarter. Next I'd like to discuss ClarusONE. We are pleased with the progress we've made so far in our manufacturer discussions and we are in line with our plan. McKesson continues to be encouraged by our partnership with Walmart and we are looking at opportunities in which we can expand the relationship. We're also pleased with the progress of our multi-year initiative to implement differential pricing for brands, generic, specialty, biosimilar and OTC drug classes, in line with the services we provide to both our customers and manufacturing partners in the each of the five categories. We continue to address these important changes, as we work through contract renewal cycles. Turning to Rite Aid's recent announced asset purchase agreement. Based on public comments made by Walgreens, they indicate an anticipated six-month regulatory review, followed by a six-month phased transition period. Therefore, we continue to anticipate a full-year contribution from Rite Aid in our fiscal 2018 guidance. I would also like to call out our recently announced acquisition of BDI Pharma, which allows us to provide our customers with broader plasma and related offerings and complement our current health system in alternate site channels. We also expect to bring more value to our manufacture partners through increased scale and customer penetration. Turning now to McKesson Specialty Health. We recently announced the closing of our acquisition of intraFUSION which further strengthens our multi-specialty offerings and through our commitment to the transition to value-based care, we support approximately 800 physicians who participated in the CMS Oncology Care Model over the last year. This represents greater than 1/3 of all participating providers being supported by McKesson Specialty Health, an unparalleled commitment to value-based oncology. Moving to our Canadian business. We had nice growth in the quarter, which results – with results that were in line with our expectations. Our Canadian operations represent a diverse collection of businesses, similar to those in the U.S., with a particular emphasis on full-line distribution, specialty and infusion services and owned and banner retail pharmacies. We're making progress on the Rexall integration, which further enhances McKesson's retail pharmacy capacities, procurement scale and leading pharmacy care for patients across Canada. We've also broadened our specialty offerings upon closing the acquisition of GMV Distribution. GMV is a leading provider of specialty pharmaceuticals and expands our multi-specialty presence across Canada, while further strengthening our current physician and manufacturing relationships. Finally, our recent CoverMyMeds acquisition is now part of the newly formed McKesson Prescription Technology Services business. CoverMyMeds automates and accelerates the prescription approval process, known as electronic prior authorization, which is otherwise manual and time-consuming and therefore takes administrative costs out of the system. CoverMyMeds allows us to support patient health through drug adherence, manufacturers by reducing prescription abandonment, and providers and payers through automation and appropriate patient access to medications. We're excited about the meaningful improvements this technology represents for these stakeholders. Turning now to our results for international pharmaceutical distribution and services. Revenues for the first quarter was $6.4 billion, up 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and operating performance from Celesio was in line with our expectations for the quarter. While we continue to monitor reimbursement developments in the UK, we remain encouraged by the growth delivered by the rest of the Celesio enterprise. And finally, our Medical-Surgical business performed well in the quarter with revenues of $1.5 billion, an increase of 4% over the prior year, driven by market growth, including strong performance from our recent investment in laboratory distribution. In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of our Distribution Solutions segment in the first quarter and as I noted in my earlier remarks, we are encouraged by the progress made by management of Change Healthcare, since its creation just over a quarter ago. Now to wrap up my comments, McKesson's first quarter results represent solid execution across both segments, and we are raising our full-year outlook for fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings to a range of $11.80 to $12.50 per diluted share. We believe we are well-positioned to drive future growth with our scaled global sourcing capabilities, expanded global retail footprint, growing specialty business in the U.S. and overseas, and our leading technology solutions for our Distribution Solutions customers. We're extremely well-positioned to execute our portfolio approach to capital deployment and deliver value for our shareholders through a mixture of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. With that, I'll turn the call over to James and we'll return to address your questions, when he finishes. James?
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As John discussed earlier, we are raising our fiscal year 2018 adjusted earnings outlook to $11.80 to $12.50 per diluted share which reflects our first quarter results that were very much in line with our expectations and the positive full-year impact of incremental share repurchases completed in the quarter. Please note the underlying assumptions that were detailed in our fourth quarter press release are being reiterated today, unless stated otherwise. Now let's move to our results for the quarter. My remarks today will focus on our first quarter adjusted EPS of $2.46, which excludes the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments, LIFO inventory related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring charges and other adjustments. You may recall that when we provided our initial guidance and further commentary at our Investor Day, we noted the quarterly progression of our fiscal 2018 performance, being back-half weighted. This timing reflects, in part, our ongoing contract renewal work with our customers and manufacturer partners, where we are reflecting the differential economics of brand, generic, specialty, biosimilar and OTC products, as John mentioned previously. These ongoing contract renewals, also reflect reduced variability in our compensation, resulting from manufacturer pricing actions. Our ongoing success with these contract renewals did however create a timing headwind for our Q1 earnings. Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedule 2 and Schedule 3. Consolidated revenues for the first quarter increased 4% in constant currency. First quarter adjusted gross profit was down 6% in constant currency year-over-year, driven by the planned lapping effect of increased competitive pricing in our independent pharmacy business, weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends, some timing items driven by our ongoing contractual renewal progress with certain manufacturer partners, and lower profit in our Technology Solutions business driven primarily by the contribution of the majority of businesses to Change Healthcare, partially offset by acquisitions and organic growth including the ClarusONE joint sourcing entity. First quarter adjusted operating expenses increased 5% in constant currency, driven by acquisitions, partially offset by the Change Healthcare transaction and ongoing cost management efforts. Adjusted other income was $13 million for the quarter, a decrease of 43% in constant currency. Adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare, was $70 million for the first quarter. We are pleased with the progress of Change Healthcare; the management team has come together to cohesively lead the new organization and begin the work of both identifying opportunities to further expand our customer relationships, and realizing meaningful synergies. I'd like to reiterate our prior guidance, that Change Healthcare will generate between $370 million and $430 million of pre-tax earnings, reflecting our 70% ownership of the joint venture. At the same time, we have made a refinement to our estimate of the way tax expense is attributed to the joint venture's profits. Including tax expenses, now expected to be accounted for within Change Healthcare, we project our adjusted equity income from the Change Healthcare joint venture will be between $250 million and $310 million in McKesson's fiscal 2018 P&L. Again, this reflects no material change in our full-year expectation for pre-tax earnings to be generated by the Change Healthcare joint venture; rather, it is a refinement in where taxes are reflected in our income statement. Our full-year tax rate for McKesson is now estimated to be approximately 25%, down from our original estimate of 27%. The net effect of these two updates is neutral to the original guidance for fiscal 2018 that we provided in May. Also note that we do not expect a cash tax impact to McKesson as a result of this refinement. Now, continuing down the income statement, interest expense of $68 million decreased 14% in constant currency for the quarter, driven primarily by the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates. Our adjusted tax rate was approximately 26.5% for the quarter. Our income attributable to non-controlling interests or NCI was $56 million for the quarter, an increase of 217% in constant currency. As a reminder, the increase in NCI year-over-year was primarily driven by ClarusONE, our fully operational, joint sourcing entity with Walmart. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations totaled $523 million, with our first quarter adjusted EPS at $2.46 per diluted share, down 22%, compared to $3.15 in the prior period. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 213 million, down 7% compared to the prior period. Let's now turn to the segment results which can be found on Schedule 3. Distribution Solutions segment revenues were $50.9 billion. On a constant currency basis revenues were up 5% year-over-year. Revenues were impacted by approximately $400 million in unfavorable currency rate movements. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 5% in constant currency, driven by market growth and acquisitions, partially offset by brand to generic conversions. International Pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6.4 billion for the quarter. On a constant-currency basis, revenues were up 6% driven by acquisitions and market growth. Revenues were impacted by approximately $300 million in unfavorable currency rate movements. In mid-July, the UK government announcement further reimbursement cuts. We are assessing both the economic impact of these changes on McKesson and potential business initiatives to help mitigate these government actions. Moving now to the Medical-Surgical business, revenues were up 4% for the first quarter, driven by market growth. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit was up 7% on a constant-currency basis for the quarter, driven by acquisitions and organic growth, including contributions from ClarusONE, partially offset by the planned lapping effect of increased competition in our independent pharmacy business and the expected weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends. Let me, for a moment, touch on branded pharmaceutical price increases. The June quarter has traditionally included modest brand price increases and our first quarter experience was slightly ahead of the assumption included in our plan. I would remind you that in addition to timing, frequency and magnitude, the mix of which manufacturers initiate price adjustments has an important affect on our overall compensation. Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating expenses increased 18% on a constant-currency basis for the quarter. Segment operating expenses reflect an increase driven by acquisitions, partially offset by ongoing cost management efforts. Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating profit was down 10% in constant currency year-over-year at $887 million. The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 173 basis points on a constant-currency basis, a decrease of 28 basis points driven by the same factors as previously discussed, as well as our growing mix of higher priced specialty pharmaceuticals, partially offset by the beneficial contribution from ClarusONE. We continue to expect our full-year Distribution Solutions adjusted operating margin rate to be between 198 basis points and 208 basis points. Our operating margin rates will be supported by organic growth, including the contribution from ClarusONE, recent acquisitions and the lapping of previously discussed headwinds as we proceed through the year. Now moving to Technology Solutions, as a reminder, in fiscal 2018 MTS segment revenues, adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating expenses contain only the results of our Enterprise Information Solutions business. Revenues were $120 million, while adjusted segment gross profit was $61 million. Adjusted segment operating expenses were $44 million and adjusted operating profit, excluding the equity contribution from Change Healthcare was $17 million. I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding decreased 1 day from the prior year, to 26 days. Our days sales in inventory decreased 1 day from the prior year to 29 days and our days sales in payables was flat to the prior year at 59 days. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.3 billion, with approximately $1.7 billion held offshore. And in the first quarter, McKesson generated $741 million in cash flow from operations. We continue to deploy capital in line with our portfolio approach in fiscal 2018 priorities. In the first quarter, we spent $118 million on internal capital investments, and we paid $541 million in long-term debt. We also repurchased $250 million in common stock in the first quarter. We now expect our weighted average diluted shares to be approximately $212 million for the full year. And we now have approximately $2.5 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We also paid $1.5 billion for acquisitions during the first quarter, which included the closing of CoverMyMeds as previously announced on April 3. And yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.34, an increase of $0.06 or 21%. This dividend will be payable to shareholders in October, and reflects our commitment to the dividend as a part of our portfolio approach to capital deployment. Now let me briefly touch on Rite Aid. While Rite Aid has announced a new transaction with Walgreens, our guidance range continues to assume a full-year full year revenue contribution from Rite Aid of approximately $13 billion, and an estimated annual adjusted earnings per share contribution of between $0.20 and $0.40. Based on Walgreens' public comments, that they expect the regulatory review of this new transaction to take approximately six months, and that if approved, the stalls involved would be transitioned over a subsequent six-month period, we feel comfortable with our fiscal 2018 assumption. And as you think about the cadence of our earnings in fiscal 2018, I'd like to reiterate my previous comments that our results will be more heavily weighted to the second half of the fiscal year. Consistent with our historical experience, we expect the fourth quarter to be the strongest. Also, in our second quarter, we will continue to be impacted by a lapping effect from last year's increased competitive pricing in our independent pharmacy business. Throughout the remainder of the year, we will benefit from the increasing contribution of ClarusONE, additional organic growth and our recent acquisitions. In closing, McKesson delivered first quarter results that were in line with our expectations. In addition, our cash flow generation allowed us to address each of these four pillars of our capital deployment strategy, and our Q1 share repurchases are driving our updated fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS outlook of $11.80 to $12.50. Thank you and with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. Today's question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. Our first question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Thanks very much and good morning. James, let me just start with trying to understand the cadence of the earnings. I understand you were talking about it being more heavily back-half weighted, but given where the Street was in this quarter versus what you delivered and where you said this was in line with your expectations, I just want to make sure that we have this lined up correctly, especially as we think about next quarter and think about having to lap some of the pricing issues; is there anything more that you can give us directionally as we think about the second quarter?
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Well, obviously a few factors driving the quarterization of the fiscal 2018 guide, in particular, Q1 was impacted by that lapping effect of last year's activity, enhanced pricing activity around the independent pharmacy space, and then also, as we had assumed going into the fiscal year, we did see lesser brand manufacturer price increase activity than we've seen in some other years. And also made note at the start of my remarks, as to in Q1 in particular, there were two contracts with the manufacturers as we went through our renewal process, that is focusing our activity on the relevant economics for each of the five categories of our work, that both John and I referred to, namely the brand, generic, specialty, biosimilar and OTC, but also those renewals focused on our interest in seeing less variability to the branded manufacturer pricing actions. Of course, we don't take those decisions, so it's helpful for us to have a little less variability to pricing. And so that issue in particular, those two contract renewals did have an impact on Q1 and there will be a beneficial impact later in the year. Not surprisingly, we always see Q4 as the strongest of the quarters, given that that is traditionally when branded manufacturers take the majority of their price increases. And then the other factors to really think through is, as the year proceeds, we'll continue to see nice organic growth across the businesses and also, obviously, we invested substantially in acquisitions over the last 12 to 18 months. So, as those new parts of our company progress against their business cases, I'm expecting that we'll see additional earnings benefits from them as the year progresses.
Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Okay, great. And then, just my follow-up would be for John. John, in your prepared comments, you made a comment that you feel that things have stabilized, and they're (28:15) competitive when we think about the independent market for generics. Can you just maybe give us a little more color as to what you're really seeing in the market and what gives you that confidence?
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thanks for the question, Lisa. I think at the time that we talked about this unusual activity in the prior year, during the prior year, I made the comment that we had – we don't see that type of activity frequently, and when we've seen it in the past, it tended to stabilize or revert back to competitive, but less variable over time. And I think that, that prognosis or forecast in terms of where we thought things would go has proven to be accurate, and obviously, things can change at any point in time, but I would say that we've gone back to an environment which is competitive, but certainly not out of line with the kind of competitive activity that we would have typically seen prior to fiscal 2017. So I would say that that's the best way I could characterize it, is it's back to competitive and less variable.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with UBS.
Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the color. Maybe thinking a little bit and building off of Lisa's question a bit more, as you think about some of the other moving pieces that get better into the back half of the year, particularly the pricing environment, I guess, how do you check the growth points along the line to make sure that what you think about relative to brand inflation which I think you said came in little bit better, generic deflation, all against the backdrop of some of the contract changes are falling in line with your plans? And I guess, how much visibility at this point, do you have into some of those changes?
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, I think it's fair to say that when we had our guidance discussion at the end of our fiscal year and again at our Analyst Meeting, we talked very specifically about how we saw the year playing out and I guess what we're seeing today is it's playing out as we had anticipated it would play out. We may not have done an effective job of messaging it to you given where the Street has been in the quarter, but clearly it's in line with our expectations and we typically have pretty good visibility throughout the year. And as James mentioned, if you think about our renewal cycle of both with our customers and our large manufacturing partners, you can clearly see how the changes in those relationships will be reflected in future financial results. And so, I would say, on those dimensions, clearly we have better visibility and perhaps less variability than we would have had in an environment where we were more dependent on price increases as a piece of our business model. Clearly, we can't entirely forecast acquisitions with 100% certainty, but we have a pretty good track record of getting the synergies out of the capital we deploy and giving the returns to our investors that are appropriate given the risk that we take and the other alternatives like buying our stock back. So, if you believe the three principle drivers are the sort of the calenderization of our earnings with manufacturers, the impact of acquisitions as they get closed and integrated, and things like NorthStar, our private label products and the higher growth and our higher margin businesses frankly, we can see that with pretty good, accuracy. So, I think that we would not have confirmed our guidance here and the raise, as James mentioned, was related to the share repurchases. We would not have done that, if we didn't believe that it was an accurate representation of our belief going forward.
Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks. I'll leave it at one.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: Good morning, guys. Maybe just a quick update on how some of the recent acquisitions are sort of trending, particularly some of the maybe the newer businesses to you, like Rexall or Biologics, so just love to understand how they're doing versus sort of their base M&A case when you bought them?
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Right. I think that as I said earlier, we have a pretty good track record in realizing the synergies that we forecast and I would say that we're generally in line on these acquisitions in terms of their performance. Biologics might be performing slightly ahead of its acquisition case and we've been very pleased with that acquisition, and Rexall is really in line with this – I'd say a little bit newer than Biologics is. And then the rest of our acquisitions like CoverMyMeds, et cetera, are all performing at or above our expectations. So, I'm quite pleased with not only the performance financially, but the strategic position that these acquisitions put us in. As you can imagine, we are investing in higher margin businesses in the case of Biologics and CoverMyMeds, et cetera, and we're investing in businesses that in the case of Rexall that are not only higher margin, but they're also allowing us to have more control over the selection of product, and that control allows us to deliver more value to the manufacturers that we do business with. And so, it's part of a long-term strategy, frankly, on both of those fronts to be more exposed to specialty, because of its higher growth and be more meaningful to manufacturers. James, you might have something to add.
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: And while we don't look at this in our business cases that underpin the acquisitions themselves, I've been pleased so far with the opportunities that are starting to evolve for groups like CoverMyMeds to work with other parts of our business, Relay Pharmacy for example on the Rexall side, the discussions that are really ongoing now with other parts of retail across our organization. So that's not a short-term synergy opportunity. It's not something that's part of the business case, but I'm encouraged that there's quite an opportunity I think over the longer-term for us to really benefit from this portfolio of assets that we've built up over the years.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: And I also mentioned, Ross, in my comments about Med-Surg and our exposure to laboratory and our entrance into the lab business, principally in the physician space, but also in the smaller hospitals where they've been underserved from a laboratory supply perspective, and that business is growing nicely for us and it's higher margin and higher growth than the baseline businesses. So, we think we're well positioned.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: And maybe just as a follow-up, historically you guys have been tremendous stewards of capital and M&A has always been a hallmark, and I always think of you as being a pretty creative and value-based buyer. I guess, in an environment with where we are with multiples, et cetera, how would you sort of characterize more the mid-to-small size tuck-ins that you guys typically do? What does that environment look like? Is there a pretty ease in pipeline or valuations still amenable in certain areas? How are you sort of thinking about just the overall backdrop?
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: First, thanks for the compliment, and we appreciate the fact that we've represented good stewards of capital, and that we have a track record of executing. And clearly, if you overpay, there's no ability to create value and so, that discipline upfront is extremely important. But, I'd say, as evidenced by the frequency of our acquisitions in the last year and already into this year, you can see we find creative spots to deploy capital and to your point about sort of innovation and creativity, we're typically not (35:51), that are all chasing the deal or chasing an opportunity. We have our teams focused on building relationships with potential sellers long before they're interested in selling, and then we create a positive environment for those transactions to be completed. And for their teams to continue to come to McKesson and deliver not only value to us, but careers for themselves, and that combination makes us an attractive partner. When many times these companies are privately owned or certainly heavily influenced by the entrepreneurs that may own them, we're a good place for people to continue to grow and develop and be rewarded for their performance. And I think that makes us a preferred alternative in many cases. So, obviously, when multiples start to trade up, it makes it more difficult, but we're patient, and we'll wait for the right opportunities.
Operator: Our next question comes from Garen Sarafian with Citi Research.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning, John and James. I guess more of a big picture question on procurement. So, distributors have clearly gained share and enlarged the pie, in terms of level of generics purchased through you for a variety of reasons. But from a high level, could you describe what that does to the marketplace from a procurement perspective? So, for example, in North America, you've completed signing contracts with the new retail client via ClarusONE and now one of your peers is embarking on adding a PBM, and then incremental retail line. So, does that cause any disruption in your contracting or does that impact your assumptions in terms of generic contributions, as maybe pricing deflates at a different rate or other factors investors should think about as these types of events occur?
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, I think it's a good question and a complex question. I would say that as a backdrop, I believe that the large buyers of generics are relatively comparable in terms of what we're attempting to do, and the results that we're achieving. I would say that clearly incremental volume plays a role in all of this, but I think that the difference between any of us at any one time is not significant, and I think McKesson and certain molecules with certain manufacturers would be superior and in other cases, others may beat us. But if you put it all together as a basket, I'm pretty confident we buy as well as anyone. As it relates to the deflation environment related to our activity in the procurement side, clearly we're trying to get the best deal we possible can for ourselves and for our customers, and we want to make sure that our customers are receiving a competitive price for the service and value that we deliver including the product price. Having said all of that, the deflation that occurs through better sourcing is not an automatic pass-through into the marketplace. We want to make sure we are competitive, but at the same time, obviously the investment to create a ClarusONE needs to be appropriately funded, and provide us the appropriate returns. And so we're focused on making sure that we are responsible for returning to our investors against those investments and that'll continue to be our focus. So, I think we're optimistic that our procurement activity will continue to be best-in-class and we will continue to add capabilities there over time and maybe new product categories and obviously new customers et cetera, but I feel pretty comfortable we're managing it appropriately.
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: And perhaps just to add on to that from a more technical perspective, as we look at the economic drivers of our results, our ability to flow through effectively on the generic side in this deflationary type environment has net-net been supportive to our results.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. And changing gears a little bit, on Rite Aid, you mentioned you're using public Walgreens comments and your assumptions for the year on the portion that Walgreens is taking over, but how do you think of the rest of the business where there's also a part of that deal, some pricing terms for the reminder of Rite Aid. Should they continue to or would they want to use Walgreen? So, the rest of the business, how you're thinking about it, as to what the realistic options are?
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, clearly, we're pleased for both Walgreens and Rite Aid, that they've been able to find a new deal that they believe, they'll be successful with and obviously, we're also pleased that that new deal has some remainder of Rite Aid, not only the corporate side of the entity of Rite Aid, but certainly a large portion of their stores that will remain. And that we've been a long-term valued partner with Rite Aid. And I certainly would hope and expect that relationship would continue. Clearly, the economics for both Rite Aid and McKesson change with their smaller enterprise and we've attempted to reflect to you, what the full enterprise is worth to us, in terms of revenue and earnings. So, at least you have some boundaries as to how valuable the business is to us, and what it might be to us going forward as you describe. So, I think we believe, we can compete very well with anything that our competitors would provide, and we compete very well with anything that our other sourcing entities can provide from a value perspective, and we're hopeful that we'll continue a long-term relationship with Rite Aid well past the transaction with Walgreens.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Bank of America.
Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks. Good morning, John and James. So just based on simple math, I mean the SG&A seem to be pretty high in the quarter with distribution gross profits growing 4% to 5%, but distribution EBIT down about 10% year-over-year, and just based on your comment, it seems like the biggest delta on getting that gross profit growth and EBIT growth is closer to each other for the rest of the year is mainly acquisition, integration, is that an accurate assessment or are there other key factors there?
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Well, I would say that there are more variables that are at play; it's really the combination of the opportunity for organic growth right across the businesses, as well as the impact of acquisitions. And then obviously, we've discussed the ebbing of this lapping effect around sell-side independent pharmacy space. In terms of the expense side of the ledger, we've talked about how we've been looking to invest some in expenses, particularly focused around information technology investments in the coming year. On the other side of the coin, one of the attributes that I was very pleased about in terms of the U.S. Pharma, our performance in Q1 was the productivity efficiency that they were generating out of that part of the business as a result of our ongoing capital expenditure investments and other process improvements that they've made in that business. So we'll continue to invest in process improvements that we think can improve the competitiveness of our cost structure that will take some incremental expense in the short run, and we think that that will be worth it in the longer run.
Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And just a quick follow up on that, just on the M&A. You mentioned that some of the recent acquisitions were higher margin, it might be tough to answer this on the fly, but when we do look at that 4% to 5% gross profit growth in Distribution Solutions in the quarter, do you know how much of the acquisitions contributed to that growth versus what that growth might have been organically in the quarter, is there any just rough assessment of that?
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Well, we don't bring that out specifically, but obviously those acquisitions are going to build gradually, so I wouldn't want to overstate the impact of those acquisitions in the first year or so. When we've announced acquisitions like CoverMyMeds for example, we noted that come year three, we'd be driving between $0.30-$0.40 of accretion from that acquisition. But that builds gradually particularly in that first year, where oftentimes there is some additional investment spending that goes into the equation for us to be able to really drive that accretion in the second year and third year and so forth.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks for the questions. I guess just want to go back to the SG&A, James, I guess I'm still just a bit confused. I think everyone was anticipating the headwinds in the quarter coming from the things that arose in 2Q last year, the branded pricing and the competitive environment, but really relative to expectations the short fall this quarter was from SG&A and in particular it looks like from Distribution Solutions scope. Can you just go back and maybe explain a little bit more what exactly happened in the quarter relative to operating expenses and how should we think about those as we progress through the year?
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Well, another item that is relevant on the expense side of the ledger is obviously, that we've reset our assumptions around various variable compensation programs, and so forth. So that becomes an element of the equation and in certain of our geographies, there were some additional expense resets around salaries and so forth. So, a variety of different factors, but overall, we feel comfortable with the level of spend, as I say, the focus on the investments to drive down expenses over time and right across the management team, we're very focused on improving our spend performance quarter by quarter.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: And I'd also say, Robert, the spend level in the quarter was not something that was a surprise to us. It was factored into our planning when we gave you the full-year guidance. So, I would say that the way the P&L has played out for us in the quarter is in line with what we expected it to be when we gave you the original guidance months ago and that's only the additional cover I give you. It may be surprising to you, but we had factored this in because we could see the investment in the mix changes and the acquisitions et cetera, as we looked at the quarter.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: No, that makes sense, John. I think, we, obviously, were focused more on the headwinds that had come up last year, and I think that's where it probably differed in the model. But I guess, James, just if I could go over to pricing, I wanted to get a better understanding of what you guys are seeing on generic pricing, and in particular I'm thinking about the buy side part of the equation; how has that trended relative to expectations? And then probably, more importantly, as you guys look forward given some of the FDA's recent statements and goals of accelerating generic approvals, how do you foresee generic pricing playing out into the future?
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Well, on the generic manufacturer side of things, we went into the year assuming a very nominal benefit from those molecules where we would be seeing price inflation and that's very much as things are playing out, very limited effects there. On the broader generic molecule spectrum, we've been talking earlier in one of our responses about the deflation environment, and net-net, I observed that for our sourcing capacities, or our in-house capabilities as such that we see this environment as a net driver of our overall economic, so we're happy with the situation there. In terms of the FDA and there a part to drive more approvals and therefore potentially put greater numbers of manufacturers into a specific molecule, obviously, you've got an overall supply-demand balancing equation there that will impact the pricing environment net-net, it is a generic type marketplace after all. But I would just offer also that in some of those circumstances the FDA is focused on a molecule where there's any one manufacturer today, and so they're interested in having two or three manufacturers and that can actually provide a helpful environment again for our sourcing capabilities to be able to drive better value for our customers.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, good morning. So, first of all, just a follow up on the question on the SG&A. So just to clarify going forward now that these acquisitions are part of the business. Is that the state that we should model between COGS and gross profits versus operating expenses?
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Well, I think it's fair to say that, as John was alluding to, these figures were very much in line with our plan and so, as we're bringing on acquisitions in the year-over-year expense base, you're obviously going to see step function increases commensurate with bringing on those acquired expense basis. So I would again rest assure that we'll continue our ongoing focus on cost management, but directionally, yes, you'll see some step function increases as the likes of Rexall come into the P&L for example.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: And I think also, Ricky, one of the challenges from the P&L perspective is that the incremental profit delivered by the acquisitions even in the first order before we realized the synergies was vastly offset by the year-over-year lapping problem that James mentioned earlier related to independent price effects in the prior year. So when you think about why didn't we see a margin lift in terms of the acquisitions and all we saw was the expense lift is, because the margin lift from the acquisitions could easily be offset by the two dimensions that James mentioned. One is the lapping effect of independent pricing last year, and the effect of our continued work from the manufacturer contracting perspective that we talked about previously.
Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So what would be really helpful for us is if you can just help us quantify what's the magnitude of these headwinds that we're reaping (50:55) when we think about just the combination of the price competition and independent and (51:01) pharmaceutical pricing. So we can kind of in fact normalize that it sounds like run rate as we think about second half?
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. I don't have that for you on this call. We would certainly think through how we might articulate that effect going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with Needham & Company.
Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Question on ClarusONE; is there a cadence declarence for ClarusONE in terms of the profitability over the course of the year? I'm assuming it will grow and become more profitable as the year progresses. That's the first question on ClarusONE. The second one is, you talk about other opportunities with Walmart and with ClarusONE, is this the kind of relationship where you could get in and help the medical side of your business as well? Are you going to be able to get into products and the like there?
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: I'll let James talk about the cadence, and I'll talk about the product portfolio. James?
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: In terms of the cadence, you're right, I would expect that to build profit contribution as the quarters of the year go by, and obviously, in the last few months, we've really just been getting started and we're very pleased with the momentum that, that team is building around sourcing results. So, yeah, I'd be absolutely looking for a steady build as the year goes along.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: It's difficult for me to perhaps articulate what opportunities would be in front of us like Clarus, because we have a partner there that needs to engage in that opportunity as well. So I'm not speaking that behalf of Walmart. But if you wanted to look at opportunities, you certainly could think about everything that a Walmart store in the U.S. purchases today, and think about what McKesson would also be purchasing for our clients and non-Walmart clients, and all of those would provide opportunities for us to move them to ClarusONE in a way that would be perhaps productive for both companies and our combined customers. I would also say that ClarusONE is specifically focused on U.S. so there might be other U.S. Walmart opportunities as well as global opportunities that both companies could bring together. And last, I would say on the medical side, we clearly are heavily focused on our medical business in private label and our global sourcing activity, which is outside of ClarusONE has been very effective at driving value for us on the medical products that are typically used in the alternate site settings that we focus on. And that, I consider that separate and distinct for medical products that are sold at retail pharmacies like over-the-counter items, which would be closer to home to Clarus, but both are opportunities for us.
Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. And if I can do one quick follow-up. I'm a little confused on the impact of the manufacturer contracting and sort of how that works; why would something like that become more profitable over the course of the year? Is there an exclusive on a product launch or a generic or something like that? I just don't really understand how that would work?
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Well, I won't be able to get into the specifics of these two particular contracts with some of the larger manufacturers, but it did create in essence a headwind for Q1 and we would look for a smoother introduction of contribution for us in the quarters remaining in the year, Q2 through Q4. So, in the net result, which we're pleased about is less variability around a manufacturer's pricing actions. Obviously we don't take those decisions. So, we're interested in smoothing out the impact on our P&L from the actions of others.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. I think that's absolutely accurate, and once again, we had anticipated the outcome of these relationship changes when we provided the original guidance, and I think if there's a reflection on the disconnect, it really is our ability to articulate what we were doing in our business. At the two major points, we had an opportunity to articulate them apparently, was not as clear as it could have been and that's why you guys look at this quarter and say, gee, it seems odd compared to what we expected. But I want to once again confirm and reaffirm what James said is that it's certainly in line with what we expected and we expect that the following three quarters will be in line with what we expect as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink.
David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC: Hi. I think you mentioned that North American pharma revenue was up organically year-over-year. Can you talk a bit more about that? How much of that is being driven by price versus volumes and if you're winning share in the market, any color around which channel it's coming from; hospitals, retails, independent doc offices? Any more color on that growth would be very helpful. Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thanks for the question. Clearly, we're pleased with the growth of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business and our position in the marketplace. As we've said in the past, we typically focus on gaining share of wallet within our existing customers where they're buying product that they're not buying from us or in some cases, entering product categories or expanding their presence in categories where both of us are finding incremental revenues. I think clearly there's just flat out market growth. So, I would not – I don't think our revenue growth in our business is that far outside of what the market is growing, if you think about specialty and just straight out demographics. So I think that clearly whatever price happens in the market flows through our business, and the volumes are probably pretty typical with what the volumes are from a growth perspective at a baseline.
David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay. Great. And then you also mentioned tech pharmacy solutions. Is that like a new entity within your organization and like what is in that? And did that get classed in the distribution division and is that like, I guess, group of assets driving up operating expenses in the quarter relative to last year?
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: So the business you're referring to is the coming together of three previous sub-businesses if you will. One that focuses historically on distributing technologies to pharmacists to help them manage their business, then the Relay Pharmacy business, which is a switch business, across which so many transactions between the pharmacy and the payer move, and then also the new acquisition of CoverMyMeds. So, I was alluding, earlier in one of my answers, to the opportunities that we're seeing for new improvements across these businesses and I'm pleased that we've been able to bring them together under a single preservant to really drive the full opportunities that we think these assets provide. I think they can be higher growth. John mentioned, they're higher margin, so there will be a particular focus on these businesses going forward.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: But as it relates to the change period-over-period, the biggest change is the movement of CoverMyMeds into McKesson and the movement out of MTS of our Relay Pharmacy business, and these businesses will carry a higher expense rate as it relates to revenue, but they carry a much higher margin as well, and once again, the margin impact to the segment was probably muted by the year-over-year lapping of the previous discussed independent pharmacy price challenges that we face. So you have a situation where the expenses come in, and the incremental margin got absorbed in the lap, and that's why you have a more difficult compare.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just digging deeper into branded pricing, especially since we're in July for mid-year. So you talked about it being slightly above expectations. Would you mind just giving some color on, are we seeing that on the rate or is it the number of price increases? And then, if you don't mind just also giving us what percentage of your gross profit dollars are still tied to pricing. I think before you've said it's around 10%. Thanks.
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. I'd say the contribution from our branded manufacturer partners is still around 90% on a fixed type basis around 10 points of it coming from more variable measures around price increases, so the manufacturers take. In terms of what's going on around the branded manufacturer pricing environment, we are seeing little bit less of a frequency, it's fair to say, but also as we said in our text, the mix of which manufacturers take the price increases is important to our economics, because obviously we have a blend of contract structures some are entirely fixed and others offer us a portion of the economics that we can earn as a result of a price increase activity.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: I think we have time operator for one last question. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen.
Unknown Speaker: Hi. It's James (01:01:19) on for Charles. You mentioned earlier in the call that you're encouraged by recent developments in the pursuit of strategic alternatives for EIS. Can you elaborate on that, what new developments?
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, thanks for the question. Clearly, we've been focused on making sure that we think about the strategic alternatives for our EIS business. We believed there were other places where that business might be able to grow more rapidly than inside of McKesson and we've been pursuing evaluation of those strategic alternatives and my comments were nothing more than to reinforce the fact that we – the process continues to be underway and that we're encouraged by the level of interest in alternatives that we're seeing and we hope to have more news here in the short term. I want to thank you, operator, for helping us today, and thanks to all of you on your call – on the call for you time. McKesson is off to a good start for fiscal 2018 and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us. I want to recognize the outstanding performance of our employees and their contributions to help our customers improve lives and deliver opportunities to make better health possible. I'll now hand the call off to Craig for his review of upcoming events for the financial community. Craig?
Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.: Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events for the financial community. On September 12, we will present at the Morgan Stanley Global Healthcare Conference in New York. We'll release second quarter earnings results in late October. Thank you, and goodbye.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Mr. Craig Mercer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.
Craig Mercer: Thank you, Melisa. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2017 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. I am joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO, and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update, and then James will review the financial results for the quarter and full year. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour, at 6:00 PM Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the Company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, our fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings, excludes four items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition related expenses and adjustments, claim and litigation reserve adjustments, and LIFO-related adjustments. Also, James will discuss our operating performance further adjusting for the impact of net charges associated with the cost alignment plan that we announced in March 2016, as well as the non-cash pretax good will impairment charge which is related to our EIS business within our Technology Solutions segment during the second quarter. For fiscal '16, we excluded the income sales of two businesses. Consistent with how we’ve discussed our fiscal '17 results in prior earnings calls, which reconcile adjusted earnings to adjusted earnings excluding these unusual items, the supplemental presentation is useful in reviewing the fiscal 2017 versus fiscal 2016 results discussed today. In connection with the issuance of our fiscal 2018 outlook and in consideration of investor feedback, benchmarking relative to superior companies and in line with management's view of our operating performance, we are revising our adjusted earnings definition. The revision will principally exclude gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring charges and other adjustments including asset impairments and gains or losses on disposal of businesses or assets. We filed a second 8-K with the SEC today, which includes the full text of our revise definition of adjusted earnings, as well as the recap of quarterly and full-year of fiscal 2017 results. This will allow you to compare our fiscal 2018 outlook to our revised adjusted earnings for fiscal 2017. For reference, slide 14 of the supplemental presentation provides a visual walk from fiscal 2017 adjusted EPS to adjusted EPS, excluding unusual items. Then it bridges that measures to the fiscal ’17 revise adjusted EPS. We believe the earnings press release, supplemental slides and the recap of 8-K which all includes non-GAAP measures, will provide useful information for investors with regard to the Company's underlying operating performance and comparability of financial results period-over-period. Please refer to these materials, which may be found in the investor section of our Company website, for further information and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thank you. And here's, John Hammergren.
John Hammergren: Thanks, Craig, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. I'm pleased with our fourth quarter results, which were driven by solid execution across both of our Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions segments. James, will cover our annual financial performance in greater detail. But let me provide some color on the year just concluded. If we recall, as we entered fiscal 2017, we were working hard to mitigate headwinds resulting from moderating generics inflation and customer consolidation. During fiscal ‘17, we implemented a cost alignment plan to achieve improved efficiencies and realize materials savings across our enterprise. We announced a new sourcing partnership for generics with Walmart. We entered into a plan with Blackstone to create a new scaled healthcare technology business, and we announced several acquisitions intended to, among other things, expand our retail footprint and broaden our specialty capabilities. We successfully executed against each of these major initiatives, which were transformative in nature and better position to Company for long term growth. However, we did not anticipate the sizable additional headwinds we experienced around pricing for branded pharmaceuticals in the degree of sell side price competition for generics, particularly within the independent retail pharmacy channel. Let me take a moment to provide an update on those two topics specifically; first on branded pricing. Throughout the past year, there has been increased pressure on manufacturers in the pricing decisions they make, which led the lower inflation levels than we had originally assumed in our fiscal 2017 outlook. However, it is important to note that in the fourth quarter, the compensation that we earn we earned it from brand pricing changes, was largely in line with the expectations that we shared during our last earnings call. As we entered into a new fiscal year, we’ve assumed a mid-single digit rate of brand inflation, less than what we experienced in fiscal 2017. We believe this level assumed inflation is appropriate given the degree of uncertainty around branded pricing and a reality that we’re not involved in setting drug prices. Switching now to generic pricing, while the rate of price changes in our generics pharmaceutical portfolio has varied from year-to-year, we’ve historically experienced deflation, which we define as a reduction in our cost of acquiring generic drugs from the manufactures. For McKesson, our multiple drivers of generic deflation, which included competition, supply and maturity of launched products and our sourcing efforts, the rate of deflation is specific to McKesson’s generic product mix, customer mix, ongoing negotiations and relationships with manufactures and our specific fiscal year. We consider it to be unique and proprietary and thus do not disclose rated deflation for our generic purchases. An additional factor impacting generics is a sale price environment. We operate in a competitive marketplace and the competitive nature of generics is a function of market based pricing. If you recall that in the first half of our fiscal year, we saw increased price competition in the independent retail pharmacy channel, which eventually resulted in reduced volumes for McKesson. Overtime, we’re able to recapture that loss volume and retain our share after adjusting our sell side pricing. Consistent with our update, last quarter, we continue to see a competitive market for selling generic drugs in the U.S., and less pricing variability within this customer segment. In the end, it was important that we were able to recapture our volume, but is even more significant to retain and build upon on our longstanding relationships we’ve established with customer base. This included expanding our Health Mart franchises past fiscal year, adding hundreds of new stores. Next, we’re pleased with the progress of our -- next, I would like to discuss our relationship with Walmart. It was a year ago that we announced Claris 1, our now operational collaborative generic sourcing initiative with Walmart. I am very encouraged with the remarkable progress we’ve made in the short amount of time. Walmart is largely realizing these initiatives benefits from this initiative. And we’re now progressing on discussions with manufacturers based on our joint volumes from which we expect to realize and share in additional synergies. We are encouraged by the ear success of this initiative, which demonstrates how our sourcing expertise delivers significant value. But we are optimistic that we will identify expanded opportunities to partner with Walmart in the future. Next, we’re pleased with the progress of our multi-year initiative to implement differential pricing for brand generic, specialty, bio-similar and OTC drug classes in line with the services we provide to both our customers and manufacturer partners in all of these five categories. We continue to address these important changes as we work through our contract renewal cycles. Moving on to Change Healthcare, I want to thank the current McKesson teams who worked so diligently to successfully launch this new organization. And I want to also thank our former McKesson employees who recently joined a new Company for their ongoing commitment to a thriving healthcare technology enterprise. This dedicated team of individuals successfully delivered on a challenging fiscal '17 Technology Solutions business plan while simultaneously contributing to the closing of the Change Healthcare transaction. I thank them all and congratulate them on their success. Before I wrap up, I'd like to take a few moments to discuss McKesson's role in public policy. Our policy decisions are being evaluated, and McKesson continues to engage as a key stakeholder in educating policy makers, addressing issues that may impact our industry and our business and our customers' business, and helping to drive the necessary change to support access, quality and affordability for a sustainable healthcare system. We continue to engage in dialogue with policy makers as proposals evolve towards legislation. We remain confident in McKesson's path forward, the critical role, the services we provide to the healthcare industry today and our ability to identify and apply solutions to address the most pressing challenges to healthcare systems globally. In closing, our fiscal 2017 was certainly a tough year and we faced multiple material headwinds that impacted our U.S. pharmaceutical business. I was encouraged by a number of things during the year. First, despite industry challenges, the underlying operating performance of the U.S. pharmaceutical business was improved through our focus on operational excellence and best-in-class customer service. This business is growing and is well positioned. Next, absent the material UK reimbursement cuts we've previously discussed, Celesio's business has performed nicely. In addition, we completed multiple acquisitions during the year, which had helped to expand our strong platform for growth. For Canada, the business grew nicely in fiscal 2017. And we completed the acquisition of Rexall, expanding our retail pharmacy footprint in Canada. And in medical surgical, we delivered another year of solid growth and substantially grew in the lab space, complementing our non-acute service platform. Overall, we continue to build the competitiveness of our broad portfolio of businesses, which allowed us to mitigate some of the very material industry challenges we encountered during the year at U.S. Pharmaceutical. I'm extremely proud of this management's team ability to adapt and maintain a constant focus on building the strength of our customer and supplier relationships, which will continue to drive growth and long term value creation for our shareholders. Last, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their dedication, leadership and consistent focus on putting our customer success at the forefront of everything we do. With that, I'll turn the call over to James and we’ll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?
James Beer: Thank you, John and good afternoon everyone. As John discussed earlier, we are pleased by our strong results in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EPS, excluding unusual items, was $3.42 per diluted share which gives us a solid momentum heading into fiscal 2018. I also want to highlight our record operating cash flow in fiscal '17, which allowed us to return more $2.5 billion in cash to our shareholders during the past year. Today, I will review our fiscal 2017 results and introduce our fiscal 2018 guidance range. Before I discuss our fiscal 2018 outlook, I will spend some time walking you through the changes to our definition of adjusted earnings. Now, let’s move to our 2017 results. As I have a lot of information to cover today and we want to provide ample time for Q&A following my remarks, I will primarily focus on our full year fiscal 2017 results. First, our consolidated results. As a reminder, the fourth quarter and full year revenue and operating results of MTS were impacted by the creation of the Change Healthcare joint venture, as announced on March 2nd, to which McKesson contributed the majority of its MTS businesses. McKesson will account for its equity share of Change Healthcare’s earnings on a one-month lag. Therefore, for the month of March, McKesson’s consolidated income statement contained neither the results of the MTS contributed businesses, nor any equity earnings from the new company. Consolidated revenues for the full-year increased 5% in constant currency versus the prior period, primarily driven by market growth and acquisitions. Full year adjusted gross profit, excluding unusual items, was down 2% in constant currency year-over-year, driven by increased competitive pricing in our independent pharmacy business and weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends, partially offset by contributions from acquisition closed in fiscal 2017, antitrust legal settlements, greater global procurement benefits and organic growth. Full year adjusted operating expenses, excluding unusual items, increased 2% in constant currency driven by acquisitions closed in fiscal 2017, partially offset by savings from the cost alignment plan and ongoing cost management efforts. Adjusted other income was $101 million for the year, an increase of 63% in constant currency, driven primarily by our equity investment in [indiscernible], a pharmacy operator in the Netherlands. Interest expense of $308 million decreased 13% in constant currency for the year consistent with our expectations. Now, moving to taxes. Our adjusted tax rate, excluding cost alignment plan charges and the impact to the EIS goodwill impairment charge taken in the second quarter, was 22.6% for the year, driven by the beneficial impact of the on-shoring of our MTS intellectual property in the third quarter, our mix of income and discreet tax benefits. Our income attributable to non-controlling interest or NCI was $83 million for the year, an increase of 60% in constant currency. The increase in NCI was primarily driven by Claris 1, the joint sourcing entity that we have created with Walmart, and the acquisition of Vantage Oncology. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations, excluding unusual items, totaled $2.9 billion. Our full year adjusted EPS was $11.61 per diluted share. Our adjusted EPS, excluding unusual items, was $12.91 per diluted share. During the year, we recorded $0.04 charge related to the cost alignment plan and in the second quarter we recorded a non-cash pretax goodwill impairment charge of $1.26 related to our EIS business. Wrapping up our consolidated results, during the fourth quarter, we completed share repurchases of common stock totaling $250 million, bringing our total share repurchases in fiscal 2017 to $2.3 billion. As a result of share repurchase activity, particularly in late fiscal 2016 and during fiscal 2017, our full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 4% year-over-year to $223 million. Let's now turn to the segment results. Distribution Solutions segment constant currency revenues of $197.1 million were up 5% year-over-year. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 4% in constant currency, driven by market growth and acquisitions, partially offset by brand to generic conversions. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $26 billion for the year on a constant currency basis, up 11%, driven by acquisitions and market growth. Revenues were impacted by approximately $1.2 billion in unfavorable currency rate movements. Moving now to the Medical-Surgical business, revenues were up 3% for the year, driven by the market growth and acquisition. Distribution Solutions adjusted growth profit, excluding unusual items, was down 2% on a constant currency basis for the year, driven by competition in our independent pharmacy business and weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing, partially offset by contributions from acquisitions closed in fiscal 2017 antitrust legal settlements, greater global procurement benefits and organic growth. Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating expenses, excluding unusual items, increased 6% on a constant currency basis for the year. Segment operating expenses reflect an increase related to recently completed acquisitions, partially offset by savings from the cost alignment plans and ongoing cost reduction actions. When removing the impact of acquisitions, adjusted operating expenses, excluding unusual items, decreased year-over-year. Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating profit, excluding unusual items, was down 11% in constant currency year-over-year at $3.9 billion. The segment adjusted operating margin rate, excluding unusual items, was 200 basis points on a constant currency basis, a decrease of 35 basis points, driven by the same factors as previously discussed. Now, moving to Technology Solutions. As a remainder, our MTS segment for fiscal '17 reflects only 11 months of results for those businesses that were contributed to change healthcare. Revenues decreased 9% for the year to $2.6 billion on a constant currency basis. Adjusted segment gross profit, excluding unusual items, was down 5% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted segment operating expenses, excluding unusual items, decreased 11% in constant currency from the prior year. Despite realizing only 11 months of results from the contributed MTS businesses, adjusted segment operating profit, excluding unusual items, increased 4% in constant currency, resulting in an adjusted operating margin rate of 22.33%, up 295 basis points versus the prior year. We're very pleased with the performance of the Technology Solutions segment in fiscal 2017 as the team works simultaneously to execute their business plans and close the Change Healthcare transaction. I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our day sales outstanding decreased one day to 27 days. Our day sales in inventory decreased two days from the prior year to 30 days. And our day sales in payables increased two days from the prior year to 61 days. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.8 billion with approximately $2.3 billion held offshore. For the year, McKesson paid $4.2 billion on acquisitions, repaid approximately $1.6 billion in long term debt, spent $562 million on internal capital investments and paid $253 million in dividends. In addition, McKesson repurchased approximately $2.3 billion in common stock in fiscal 2017 and we now have $2.7 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. In fiscal '17, McKesson generated $4.7 billion in cash flow from operations, inclusive of the $256 million in cash outflows related to the cost alignment plan and our settlement with the DEA and DoJ. The year-over-year growth of approximately 29% was primarily driven by several working capital initiatives across our U.S. businesses and lower cash taxes. To wrap up my fiscal 2017 comments, while McKesson face significant challenges during the year, I'm pleased with how we were able to manage through adversity, drive strong cash flow and end the year in a solid financial position. Now before I get to our fiscal 2018 outlook, let me take a moment to discuss the revision to our definition of adjusted earnings. After careful consideration, we have made the decision to revise our definition of adjusted earnings effective with our fiscal '18 outlook. We believe this revision will allow us to provide better clarity on our underlying operating performance as it closely aligns with both how we internally manage the enterprise and the definition used by others in our industry. Let me walk you through the changes at a high level. First, the revised definition retains the amortization of acquisition related intangible, LIFO-inventory related charges or credits and acquisition related expenses and adjustments; although, this category has been expanded to include certain fair value adjustments. An example of a fair value adjustment is the expected non-cash deferred revenue haircut in fiscal '18, resulting from the Change Healthcare transaction. Second, the revised definition will now adjust for gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring charges and other adjustments, which will include impairments, gains or losses on the disposal of businesses or assets and the full month standalone category of claim and litigation charges or credits. The restructuring charges that will be excluded are represented by programs such as the cost alignment plan or other restructuring programs that are considered significant. And the other adjustments category will exclude items such as the EIS goodwill impairment charge we took in the second quarter and gains from sales of businesses, such as the two differences we sold in the fiscal 2016. Again, these adjustments are intended to provide investors a better view of the underlying operating performance at McKesson. I encourage you to review the second 8-K that we filed today for the full description of each item included in our revised adjusted earnings definition, as well as the re-cost of our fiscal 2017 results, utilizing this revised definition of adjusted earnings. Before I wrap up my comments on adjusted earnings, I want to confirm that as you would expect we will continue to provide all the GAAP information that we have historically provided, including the reconciliation of our adjusted earnings to our GAAP earnings. Now, let me provide you with the details of our fiscal 2017 results on this revised basis. In order for you to drive the year-over-year performance we expect in fiscal 2018; then I will provide details on our fiscal 2018 outlook. I will point you to slide 14 of the supplemental presentation, as it provides a fiscal 2017 EPS walk, but includes reconciliation from adjusted earnings excluding unusual items of $12.91 per diluted share to our revised adjusted earnings. From the $12.91 per diluted share, we will now exclude the benefit of $144 million or $0.39 per diluted share in antitrust supplements recorded in fiscal 2017, and $15 million or $0.04 per diluted share in gains on asset dispositions. We will also exclude two headwinds; first, $10 million or $0.03 per diluted share in fair-value adjustments; and second, $10 million or $0.03 per diluted share in restructuring charges. These adjustments result in revised adjusted earnings of $12.54 per diluted share for fiscal '17. Now, turning to our fiscal 2018 outlook. In fiscal 2018, McKesson expects adjusted earnings per diluted share of $11.75 to $12.45. This guidance range reflects a decrease of 6% to approximately flat adjusted earnings year-over-year. To be clear, the fiscal 2018 outlook excludes the negative impact of the non-cash deferred revenue hiccup from the Change Healthcare transaction, which is now expected to be approximately $200 million, as it will be excluded from adjusted earnings based on our revised definition. In lieu of outlining each of the assumptions underpinning our fiscal 2018 outlook, I will refer you to the list of the key assumptions included in the press release we issued today. Instead I will walk you through the key items included in our outlook. First, I’ll start with the overall market environment. We expect Distribution Solutions revenues, which are primarily derived from North America, to grow in the mid-single digits year-over-year, driven by market growth and recent acquisitions. In the U.S. market, branded pharmaceutical manufacturer prices are tuned to increase by a mid-single digit percentage in fiscal 2018. This is a more conservative assumption than the results from fiscal '17. As we do not make these pricing decisions and because there may be variability in the timing, frequency and magnitude of pricing actions taken by manufacturers, we believe our assumption of mid-single digit price increases is prudent. On the generics side, we expect a nominal contribution from generic pharmaceuticals with increase in price in fiscal 2018, consistent with what we experienced in fiscal '17. We also expect the profit contribution from the launch of new oral generic pharmaceuticals in the U.S. market to be nominal year-over-year. As John mentioned, our overall basket of generic pharmaceuticals generally declines in price overtime, reflecting competition, supply, the maturity of launched products, and outsourcing efforts. And for the sell side pricing environment, we see the marketplace was competitive or with less pricing variability, consistent with our remarks on our last earnings call in January. Moving onto Rite Aid, as mentioned in our press release, our guidance range assumes a full year revenue contribution from Rite Aid of approximately $13 billion, and an estimated annual adjusted earnings per share contribution of between $0.20 and $0.40. Given our understanding of where things stand today with the pending merger agreement, we feel confident that we would not see volumes transition in this calendar year. If Rite Aid’s volume were to transition in early calendar 2018, this will only have a small impact on our FY18 adjusted earnings per diluted share; although, we would expect a material one-time transition impact to our cash flow, driven by the mix of our business with Rite Aid. It is worth noting that our ongoing domestic and international sourcing scale is such that the potential loss of Rite Aid's volume was not meaningfully hold up our sourcing economics with manufacturers. Now, let's move to our expanded sourcing agreement with Walmart and the mechanics of Claris 1. We announced our joint souring relationship with Walmart in May 2016. Since that announcement, McKesson and Walmart have worked to build out the new sourcing organization, Claris 1. This new organization first, focused on harmonizing pricing across our respective sourcing arrangement. This was completed late in fiscal 2017. Walmart is likely realizing the benefits from this initiative, and we are now progressing on discussions with manufacturers based on our joint volumes from which we expect to share additional synergies. That being said, because McKesson has control of Claris 1, we consolidate the results of the entity. You will see the full results of Claris 1 in our consolidated P&L, including revenues, gross profit, operating expense and operating profit. We then remove Walmart’s portion of Claris 1 earnings via the non-controlling interest line, which appears below net income in our P&L. However, it is important to note that the economics from Claris 1 included in the NCI line represents only a portion of the overall value of the expanded relationship with Walmart, as a majority of the joint sourcing value is realized in the cost of goods sold line. This COGS value is directly recognized in the accounts of McKesson and Walmart, and is not a part of the Claris 1 accounts. The non-controlling interest line now removes three items from our net income; Walmart share of Claris 1's earnings; the retail dividend; and partner income associated with other smaller non-wholly owned subsidiaries. We expect our income from non-controlling interest to increase approximately 200% from fiscal 2017. Now moving to our international segment. We expect percentage revenue growth in the mid-single digits on a constant currency basis. In addition, we expect the international business to be impacted by additional UK reimbursement cuts; although, at present, the announced incremental cuts that will impact fiscal 2018 are materially smaller than what we experienced in fiscal '17. We will keep you up-to-date on this as the year unfolds. Based on the assumptions outlined, we expect our Distribution Solutions adjusted operating margin to be between 198 and 208 basis points. The way to think about our fiscal 2018 adjusted operating margin is that our adjusted operating profit will benefit from our organic growth, the impact of FY17 acquisitions and the profits of our joint venture partners, such as Walmart in the case of Claris 1, which have consolidated in our results in accordance with GAAP. The margin rate is further aided by our revised addition of adjusted earnings and the inclusion of RelayHealth Pharmacy. Partially offsetting these positive items on margin rate will be impacted by our growing mix of higher priced specialty pharmaceuticals, assumed weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends and the lapping effect of increased competitive sell side pricing. Moving now to McKesson’s equity investment in Change Healthcare and other MTS considerations. We expect the adjusted equity earnings contribution from Change Healthcare to be between $370 million to $430 million, which reflects our 70% ownership. To be clear, we’re assuming that our equity interest in Change Healthcare will not be diluted by the impact of a potential IPO. The MTS segment also reflects the contribution from our EIS business, which is expected to generate full year revenues of between approximately $450 million and $500 million, has an adjusted operating margin rate in the single digit range. We continue to make progress on reviewing these strategic alternatives for this business. Now moving to corporate expenses, taxes and our share count. Corporate expenses are expected to be between approximately $435 million and $465 million in fiscal 2018, primarily driven by our technology investments and incentive compensation programs being reset to target expectations. The guidance range assumes a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 27%, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter. This rate is reflective of the ongoing beneficial impact of an inter-company sale of software in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Our mix business and the impact of minority interest earnings that are included in profit before tax, but are not taxable to McKesson. We expect the weighted average diluted shares for fiscal 2018 to be $213 million, which reflects the impact of share repurchase activity completed in fiscal 2017. In addition, we expect a negative foreign currency impact of up to $0.05 in fiscal 2018. Switching to cash flow, our operating cash flow is expected to decline by approximately 10% relative to the prior year. This decline is primarily driven by the loss of the majority of MTS' cash flow following the creation of Change Healthcare, as well as very strong cash generation at the end of fiscal 2017. And last, as you think about the quarterly progression of our results in fiscal '18, we expect our results to be waited to the second half of the year, primarily driven by the anticipated strength of fourth quarter results, given the seasonality of branded manufacturer pharmaceutical price increases. And for the first half of fiscal '18, we expect the second quarter will be stronger than the first quarter. Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question to allow others an opportunity to participate. Melisa?
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instruction]. And we’ll first take a question from Eric Percher with Barclays.
Eric Percher: I'd like to go back to, John, your comments on differential pricing. And I don’t think that was called out as one of the elements impacting the MTS or profit. I know there are quite a few puts and takes there. But has that been a material factor, and could you give us some detail on what you’re trying to do both upstream with the manufacturer and downstream with your customers?
John Hammergren: I do think it is certainly an important factor. I'll leave the materiality to the accountants, but it's certainly been important part of our businesses as we look at it, and we've made significant progress. And in our conversations with both our manufacturing partners, as well as our end user customer partners; so we're excited about the progress. I think people understand that the cost of handling certain of these items is different than having them all blended together. And certainly the services we provide are different and the economics associated with and when the products is different and we're pleased with the progress. We’ve more work to do, we do that systematically as our contracts are revised. But I feel good about the progress, Eric.
Eric Percher: The key driving services that are unique, or is it segmenting fees and charging separately for what you’re providing?
John Hammergren: It's probably a combination of both. clearly, to the extent that our previous discounting didn’t reflect the true cost of handling the products that needed to be modified, and to be extended that customers or manufacturers are asking us to perform new or different services, we’ve taken that on as well. So I think it's simple to mention that. And I don’t think in the past with the way we used to price our contracts, we segmented enough. And as obviously these other categories begin to grow, it's important that we price them in a more discreet fashion than as we’ve attempted to do.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll next go to Lisa Gill with J. P. Morgan.
Lisa Gill: John, I just want to go back to some of your comments on Claris 1. As I truly understand where you are with the manufacturers, obviously today, we saw bad time with Express Scripts and increased the size of their procurement entity. Is there any push back around the manufacturers in the anticipation of potentially losing Rite Aid we’ve had -- I mean how do we think about the contracting from that perspective?
John Hammergren: I think, James in his prepared remarks, made a specific comment related to Express and we don’t see any impact related to the potential loss of our Rite Aid business -- and he made a comment about Rite Aid not about Express, so to be clear. And I don’t think that when we get to a certain scale on the certain amount of materiality with the manufacturers, I don’t think there is much of the difference in the way that the manufacturers behave with any of us. I’ve said this before. I believe we’re extremely well positioned and I think our contract is very competitive. I think Walmart has benefitted significantly from the relationship. And as to where we stand in it, the normalization of the agreements between McKesson and Walmart and our respective partners help drive a lot of very quick incremental value to Walmart. And I believe that this next phase as we complete our negotiations the contracting with the manufacturers, we’re already beginning to see a reflection as a combined value of us putting our business together and committing it to these partners for a long period of time. And clearly we have the ability because our customers tell us whether our pricing in the marketplace is competitive or not. And with that customer feedback, we’re constantly adjusting our perspective on what prices, a fair price to sell at and what a fair price to buy at is. And through that intelligence I think we remain very confident in our scale and approach to doing the job it needs to do.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll next go to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser: So one question that I have, John, obviously 2017 was a challenging year, but here we are. And you made some changes to how you revise the definition of adjusted earnings you moved some business to distribution. If we think about the operating market guidance to 198 to 208 -- to 2.8 is this, in your base that you feel that you can extend margins from? And along the same lines, now you talk about mid-single growth rate for distribution for the revenue line. How should we think about the growth algorithm for the operating income? Should we think about mid-single digit as well, if you can just give more color on that?
John Hammergren: Well, I’ll have James jump in here in just a moment. I think that the principle drivers of our challenge in the previous year was the brand price inflation came in obviously below what we expected it to be. And then the very significant issue related to generic pricing that took the sell side of generics in the marketplace. And I think that we would expect that we will get up margin growth, going forward. And so I obviously always think that, and last year we had a surprise, a couple of surprises. But this year, you can see that we really don't have built into our guidance inflation on the generic side beyond nominal; and the branded inflation, we've guided, I think to a responsible range and the underlying operations of our business continue to perform very well; and the generic pricing challenges we face last year in the independent segment, as we've commented in the past, have been somewhat transitory in their nature; and recently, we have to continue to be competitive in the marketplace. Those kinds of dislocations don't happen on a frequent basis. So having said all of that, our expectation is that our margins will expand from here.
James Beer: And in terms of the Distribution Solutions’ operating profit, there are few items in through there; first of all, obviously, as we're going to benefit from the acquisitions that we entered into in fiscal '17; then we have these lapping effects of last year's headwinds, both the brand manufacturer price increase situation, as well as on the generic side the sell side environment, particularly through to the independent pharmacists. But setting those headwinds aside, I'm pleased to see U.S. pharma getting back to operating profit growth. And then you add to that the ongoing operating profit growth of remainder portfolio of businesses, which as you know, is quite diverse.
Operator: Thank you. We'll next go to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Jones: Just to go back and follow-up on the Distribution Solutions operating margin. If I look back in the guidance you guys provided, I mean, if I think back to October when you guys lowered guidance on competitive pressures and in the moderating inflation. And I think about that in the back half of '17. It seems like the negative impact from those changes would have certainly had your operating margins for fiscal '18 pointing to something down you, and yet here you are giving very encouraging operating margin guidance. So other than something like Claris 1 being an incremental positive year-over-year, did anything changed in your underlying assumptions as far as those two specific pressure points that you talked about last year, competitive pressure and moderating inflation. And I guess you -- one just kind of follow on to that, I know you don't guide to gross profit within Distribution Solutions. But would we anticipate, John, that gross profit would also be growing specifically in North American distribution?
John Hammergren: Yes, we certainly would expect gross profit in North American distribution to grow. And I would say, further, we’ve made significant progress in the operations of our Company last year. And continuing this point that progress was largely overshadowed by the significant headwinds that we faced as we went into the back half of last year. And obviously, coming to this year, we’re taking the remainder of those headwinds. But if you actually look under the covers, the rest of our Company is performing quite well and I am pleased with the fact that we can continue to show progress in our business. And clearly, some of the changes James mentioned in terms of the definition of adjusted earnings make our operating performance more clear. And we try to re-cash last years’ and this years’ so you can see how they would have compared. But James jumping here with some other color you’d like to provide…
James Beer: Yes, it's just kind of say for example two things about that change in the definition of adjusted earnings. And in the second 8-K we have broken out the FY '17 data in line with that new definition. So you'll be able to see the year-over-year type effects there. And then also just to reemphasize that because of the way the accounting looks, remember that our profit from our joint venture partners, such as Walmart's profit as a part of Claris 1, that actually gets counted in our operation profit line and therefore benefits of our operating margin rate lower down at the bottom of the P&L, we have to extract that out in terms of the non-controlling interest. So there is complexity there, and that's very much how GAAP requires us to do things. And again in the 8-K, we've tried to break out in the last of the schedules that we have there both the operating margin on a growth basis, if you will, then also net of that MCI effect. So there are few steps to move through there. But hopefully, we lay things out so you can sort through that.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll next go to Steven Velazquez with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Steven Velazquez: Just regarding the Rite Aid EPS contribution of $0.20 to $0.40 in fiscal '18, I heard that right. I think most of us have seen that EPS ruin rate could then -- it would have been a little bit a higher than that at 13 point of revenues. I guess if you compare that number for FY18 to Rite Aid contribution of the past couple of years. We've been in that same range, or has that come down perhaps from various reasons? Thanks.
John Hammergren: I think it's probably fair to say that when our margins dropped across the Company, and typically in the U.S. pharmaceutical business, I should and know the focus on U.S. pharmaceuticals is a result of the phenomena's we've been talking about that same kind of degradation in the performance of every one of our, probably every one of our customers in the U.S. pharmaceutical business was effected. And it just becomes a question of mix. And so it's fair to say that most of our customers in U.S. pharma are less profitable today than they were a couple of years ago, and you’ve seen it in our overall margin rate in that business…
James Beer: And you’re correct it was $0.20 to $0.40 of contribution from Rite Aid for the full year.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll next go to Garen Sarafian with Citigroup.
Garen Sarafian: Point to your generics assumption, setting aside the down street pressures in this past year, that's now less variable. Have you changed the underlying assumptions in any way that net out to nominal contributions for fiscal '18? And maybe related to that since we’re talking qualitatively and not quantifying, does the lower end of guidance capture worse than expected trends in generics. So that if there were say no contributions from generics increasing in price or maybe the overall generics basket deflating more than your base case. Would you still be in the serious EPS range?
John Hammergren: Well, on the generics guide, we talked about a nominal contribution, economic contribution from generics with increase in price; so very much the same guide that we offered this time last year. And then also similarly a nominal economic contribution from brand to generic conversions; we expect to see in fiscal '18. Now, as to the range of the guide, that’s always going to be driven by a mix of all of the variables that we’ve been talking about and have led out in the press release. So it we wouldn’t want to particularly so spend drop on one. But clearly that was nominal for both generic price inflation and generic conversions, I think, appropriately set out very modest expectations.
James Beer: And I would follow on to the last part of that question related to generic deflation. We’ve talked about it in the past; it's not having much of an effect on our business; and part of our normal operating model when you think about the overall way we manage our generic portfolio; and the fact that we’ve had deflation historically on a basket basis for a long time. And the deflation on our purchase of generics doesn’t necessarily translate into a deflation on the way we sell our market generics, and so that the two are distinct. And the challenge we faced last year was not the rated deflation on what we paid for generics, the issue we faced last year was acceleration in the normally competitive market on generics to become even more competitive on the sell side. And that’s what we faced in the back half of last year that we tried to discuss on previous calls. And to be clear, we don’t anticipate that level of price erosion on the sell side of our generic portfolio. Going back to what we experienced in the last half of last year, we expect it to continue to be competitive, and not as volatile as we experienced.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll next question is from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.
Ross Muken: Two part question, so probably the most common thing in my inbox is sort of trying to tease out the comparability of the updated guidance with what was expected versus discreet. And I could ask you to comment on street estimates. But if you can, James, maybe just help us think through the few components that most materially changed and just maybe repeated in terms of the prior year as we think relative to the updated guidance would be helpful. And secondary, a few of the assumptions you are talking about prior, like the deferred revenue piece. Is there anything else aside from that that changed materially that you communicated before? And then if you can help us just figure out what's the most sensitive point here. I mean there is clearly a ton of assumptions. And so when you think about which one you probably have -- not the least confident in, but may be as the widest interval of the outcome. What would you point to one or two things that maybe could be a little bit causing upper end or lower end of the range, more so than others?
James Beer: Well, obviously, there are a few moving parts here in the guide. I think about some of the bigger economic drivers that would -- to be a real different -- have some of the expectations out there. I point to our assumption around mid-single digits for branded manufacturer price increase. Yes, that is a lower assumption than that that we experienced in fiscal '17. But we think that’s the prudent thing to do for the reasons we talked about in the prepared remarks. Think about the contribution from Rite Aid that we've been quite clear on. The change in the adjusted earnings definition, there's a material impact there because up until today, we've been talking about that deferred revenue haircut that would impact the Change Healthcare income. And so now, we don't have to deal with that in adjusted earnings. And then the other thing I would say is our tax rate is probably at 27% lower than perhaps some expectations, because we've got a variety of drivers there that we're continuing to benefit from as we look forward into fiscal '18. So in terms of user variability, while we'll obviously see what the branded manufacturers actually do during the year; and one of the other important assumptions we've made is around the lapping effect on the generic sale side, the lapping effect of what happened in the independent space last year; as John has been indicating, we're seeing less volatility there. Obviously, the hopeful situation we'll see how things play out in that part of the marketplace.
Operator: Thank you. We'll next go to Michael Cherny with UBS.
Michael Cherny: I know you provided a lot of details, particularly on the change in the non-GAAP adjustments. But I want to just make sure everything is level set again on that front just there are a lot of moving pieces. In terms of the change, specifically, related to the deferred revenue adjustments. I know a lot of companies that in the tax based exempts in the past. Is this just the way you guys are recognizing it going to be a one-time adjustment and then you’ll go back to normalized margins for the Change business. Or is this going to be now part of the base as you take for interest in terms of thinking of how that's going to continue to flow through into your P&L given the 70% ownership structure?
James Beer: So in essence, we will not take that one-time decline in what would flow off the balance sheet into revenue. So we will not be impacted by what we now quantify as $200 million deferred revenue haircut effect. Obviously, that's part of the GAAP books, but that will not be showing up in our adjusted earnings.
John Hammergren: That's related to the transaction of McKesson and Change Healthcare, so it's not a comment on Change Healthcare's treatment of deferred revenue.
Operator: Thank you. We'll next go to David Larsen with Leerink.
David Larsen: Can you please just clarify, on the buy side of generics, are you seeing an inflationary environment or a deflationary environment. And then can you also comment on the hospital market, like Cardinal has evolved a lot of new capabilities, especially on the medical side. Are you seeing any sort of more aggressive competition within the facility space or not? Thanks.
John Hammergren: Well we, I think in the previous comment, I talked about generic deflation and how we believe it will continue and has for a long time. We don't really comment on the rate of deflation, because it's not a big factor that plays into the way our economics or our P&L operates. The deflation is typically not an issue that we have to guide on or that we miss or make on, it's something just part of our business model and we attempt to manage it. And this is the deflation as it relates to what we buy at. We don't necessarily comment on what we price the product at unless there's some kind of unusual circumstance, like we faced last year when we talked about generic price erosion in the marketplace, that's the sell side comment, that’s not what we will be buy the product for. The second part of your question was related to the hospital market. And we certainly have competed in the hospital market for a long-term and we used to be in the medical supply business and hospitals. And frankly found it difficult to compete with the likes of currently in the hospital market. But as it relates to the business that we retain in the hospital business, it's really in two categories. One, is in the physician office part of medical supply purchases in the hospital segment, where they own the doctors and ask for us to provide shipment to the smaller physician office facilities and practices that they own, we’re very strong there and continue to be strong. And clearly in the pharmacy business of hospitals, we have a very strong value preposition and remain very strong there. And I never take competition lightly, but I don’t believe the continued investment that Carlos is making in the medical surgical business necessarily will correlate to some change in competitive dynamics on the pharmacy side. But that's yet to be seen.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll next go to Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut: I wanted to ask John like as we think about the competitiveness of the sell side that we saw last year. Where does your confidence on part of this lag and recur this year, especially as we had saw what rebate did this morning with bringing on Express Scripts?
John Hammergren: I can only speak from 20 plus years now, the experience here at McKesson in watching how the market pricing that has evolved and how our customers have come to us overtime. We continue to build out a very significant value proposition for our customers, particularly independent customers. They always get a competitive price from us, they always get a good deal from us, and our ability to source products, I think, is second to none. Having said that on occasion in the past and infrequently, we’ll see a period of deflation on the sell side that has accelerated or price competition is accelerated and that’s what we faced last year. It may have been seven or eight years between the last year that we experienced in the last time we experienced an event like that. So could it happen every year, we sure it could happen and eventually you raise to the bottom and there is nothing more to give. But I don’t forecast that just based on historical activity. As it relates to rebates activity, certainly, I can't speak to what incremental buying power they may garner as a result of bringing Express Scripts together with them. I don’t feel we've been in a disadvantage, I don’t feel we will be at a disadvantage. And I would also say it's not necessarily a direct correlation that if someone buys better that they determine that they will increase their level of discounts and pass it all back into the marketplace. So if that were to occur, if they bought better and their partners ended up buying better and then they decided to put it into the marketplace, we would have to respond and it would be a year similar to this year.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll next go to Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company.
Charles Rhyee: John, obviously you've given us an outlook here for fiscal '18, and it looks like that things are started to normalize. When we think about the future, you look at some of your peers here and they’re deploying capital into areas of growth outside of let's say of the pharma distribution business. And here we are divesting as a chunk of our technology business into Change Healthcare. Can you talk about how you look at the longer term outlook for McKesson in terms of -- where do you think you’re going to be looking to find growth in? And what should we think about the long term outlook for growth? Thanks.
John Hammergren: We like the pharmaceutical business and we like it globally, we certainly like in U.S., and we like in Canada and we like the medical supply business and the option side markets. We believe those markets and also inside medical are growing fast and will continue to grow at a nice pace as people move out of less convenient, more costly settings for their care and have a more value orientation and a more physician centric relationship perhaps. And we like the pharmaceutical business. You can see, as an industry, the pharmaceutical business continues to grow propelled by innovation and bio-similars and new treatments coming out. Clearly, the demographics in pharmaceutical usage is improving and we see that trend globally as well. So I think we continue to feel good about our position. And you see us deploying capital, I think, in a very intelligently in high growth areas, not only in new markets where we can, I think, be a consolidator and a new service provider but also in our specialty acquisitions, you saw us buy Biologics last year -- and then Vantage, which are good acquisitions for us. We made a technology acquisition, called CoverMyMeds, which comes in with a different profit profile. And certainly now it is a good business on it' own that provides significant service to the pharmaceutical manufacturers, the pharmaceutical payers and the patients who are dependent on getting the drugs at the right time and at the right place at the pharmacy counter. And clearly, we continue to make Canadian acquisition, another one of which was announced today. So I think we are well positioned; I think we’ve got a right assets; I think these assets have a correlation across borders and across boundaries in our business; and we have synergy that we can take advantage of that in the end that delivers better value for our customers. So they can do a better job of clinical care and clearly do a better job of the economics associated with delivering that care. I think that was our last question. I want to thank you operator and thank all of your on the call for your time today. We’ve got a very solid operating plan for fiscal 2018. And I am certainly excited about the growth opportunities across McKesson. With that, I’ll turn it over to Craig to answer a few questions about our upcoming events.
Craig Mercer: Thank you, John. We will participate in the Goldman Sachs Global Healthcare Conference in Southern California on June 15th. We look forward to seeing you in the new fiscal year. Thank you and good bye.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Mr. Craig Mercer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.
Craig Mercer: Thank you, Noah. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2017 Third Quarter Earnings Call. I am joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO, and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update, and then James will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour, at 6:00 PM Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the Company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, John and James will reference adjusted earnings, which excludes four items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, claim and litigation reserve adjustments, and LIFO-related adjustments. Finally, I would call your attention to the supplemental slides, which we will reference on today's call, and those can be found on the Investors' page of our website. We believe the supplemental slides, which include non-GAAP measures, will provide useful information for investors with regard to the company's operating performance, and comparability of financial results period-over-period. Please refer to our press release announcing third quarter fiscal 2017 results and the supplemental slides, for further information and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thank you. And here's John Hammergren.
John Hammergren: Thanks, Craig, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Before I begin my review of our third quarter results, I’d like to take a few moments to share my thoughts on a number of recent topics. During January, we’ve heard from the new administration of the prospect for planned changed to the U.S. Healthcare System as well as potential tax changes. We are all interested in these topics yet it is extremely difficult to provide any kind of assessment on the impact of reform as we don’t have solid details on what those changes will be as we sit here today. We look forward to engaging in the dialogue regarding these issues that may impact our industry, our business and the customers we serve as proposals evolve into real policy positions. There are many moving pieces to reform and we will continue to monitor and assess the potential impacts of any proposals as we receive more information. Moving now, we are pleased to have announced today that we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire CoverMyMeds. CoverMyMeds mission is to help patients get access to the appropriate drugs for their care. Their service automates and accelerates the prescription approval process known as electronic prior authorisation, which is otherwise manual and time consuming. CoverMyMeds takes administrative cost out of the system which supports patient help through drug adherence, manufacturers by reducing prescription abandonment and providers and payers through automation and appropriate patient access to medications. CoverMyMeds products today streamlined a prior authorisation process for 47,000 pharmacies and 700,000 prescribers in the nation’s largest health plans. The Company has partnered with McKesson’s RelayHealth Pharmacy business since 2010 to expand its reach and offer its capabilities to a broad customer base. As a reminder RelayHealth Pharmacy is a connectivity network providing real time claims, processing and other services to more than 50,000 retail pharmacy locations. Together, CoverMyMeds and RelayHealth Pharmacy can develop even more innovative tools for manufacturers, pharmacies, patients, payers and prescribers and continue to take administrative costs and inefficiency out of the healthcare system. CoverMyMeds, RelayHealth Pharmacy and our other pharmacy technology businesses underpin our strategy to differentiate and add value to our distribution solutions business. As a reminder, RelayHealth Pharmacy will remain with McKesson following the close of the transaction to the Change Healthcare. We are also making good progress on a couple of other important transactions. First on December 20, the Department of Justice closed its review and terminated the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act bringing us one step closer to the creation of the new change Healthcare. Key leaders have been named and they are building up their teams as well as the support structure to allow the new business to meet the demands of its customers from day one. Management expects to raise the necessary financing and close the transaction later this quarter. We will provide additional updates after the transaction closes. Additionally, we are pleased to have closed the Rexall transaction and the integration work is underway. I look forward to working again with Domenic Pilla, who will assume overall leadership responsibility for McKesson’s distribution and retail businesses in Canada, including Rexall Health. Some of you may remember Domenic. He previously spend 10 years leading McKesson Canada from 2001 to 2011 and then built his retail expertise running Shoppers Drug Mart through its successful sale in 2014. I want to welcome the thousands of employees to joining McKesson on this new exciting opportunity. Last we are very excited about the progress we’ve made early on in launching [Claris 1] our sourcing activity with Wal-Mart. That organization is up in running and expanding our capabilities for suppliers. Our objective is to enhance our great partnerships with manufacturers and look for innovative ways to create value for all stakeholders. Turning now to our recent financial performance. In our U.S. pharmaceutical business as a result of the generic pricing actions we began to implement late in our second quarter, we won back units and retained our independent stores. However, our prices were ultimately set at a lower level and our initial expectations that were included in our previous guidance. As a result, we’ve realized a lower contribution in the current quarter from this part of our business. And although branded pharmaceutical pricing trends were weak in the third quarter relative to our expectations, full year contribution from branded pharmaceutical compensation remains on track with our revised expectations that we shared with you last quarter. Additionally, we incurred a few non-recurring charges in our distribution solutions segment that resulted in lower than expected operating profit contribution. James will go through those in a moment. As for our other North America Pharmaceutical businesses we continue to realize strong growth and we are making solid progress integrating Biologics, Vantage and Rexall. Moving onto our international operations despite meaningful U.K. pharmacy reimbursement cuts that we previously discussed I am pleased with the constant currency revenue growth reported in the quarter. Our U.K. business continues to be impacted by reimbursement actions taken by the government. However, our teams are diligently working to offset and grow through these changes. I’d also like to take a moment to acknowledge the tremendous contributions by Mark Owen over his past 15 years with McKesson. From leading our enterprise strategy to most recently heading up our operations in Europe. Mark will retire at the end of this fiscal year, so we are preparing for the transition of responsibilities to Brian Tyler a 20 year veteran who has served leadership positions across nearly all of our distribution solutions segment including most recently as President and Chief Operating Officer of Celesio working with Mark. And last in our medical surgical business despite some revenue softness from the termination of a long term care customer and a weaker impact from the flu season, I am encouraged particularly by the progress we are making to expand our presence in the fast growing lab in Homecare businesses. Now for technology solutions, we again posted strong performance relative to our expectations in prior year, even amidst all of the work underway to prepare for the changed Healthcare transaction. I commend the team for their focus throughout these events and I look forward to a strong finish to a very productive year. Now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2017. Upside from our share repurchase activity in the quarter combined with a lower effective tax rate more than offset the lower than expected full year contribution from our distribution solutions segment. Based on these updates we now expect our full year outlook for fiscal 2017 to be in a range of $12.60 to $12.90 compared to our previous outlook of $12.35 to $12.85. Now to wrap up my comments. McKesson is a company that has seen a significant change over its more than a 180 year history and we’ve built a resilient company, a business that focuses everyday on the success of its customers and the efficiency of the Healthcare system it serves. As we look to the future, we see significant growth prospects and it put in place the right assets in the right markets to take advantage of these opportunities. For example, McKesson now operates its scale and is highly efficient in every segment we serve. Our diverse set of global businesses are well positioned to take advantage of over arching demographic trends. We believe that retaining control over our global procurement and sourcing capabilities is key and we have built comprehensive capabilities to capture growth in specialty. We have a large and growing footprint in retail. We have a strong value proposition to partner effectively with manufacturers and to service our customers including meaningful pharmaceutical technology solutions. Across McKesson there is an experienced and long tenured management team and finally we continue to expect robust operating cash flow growth that is deployed in a disciplined approach and focused on long term shareholder value creation. With that, I’ll turn the call over to James and will return to address your questions when he finishes. James?
James Beer: Thank you, John. And good afternoon, everyone. Today I will review our third quarter results and discuss our fiscal 2017 outlook. In addition, I will provide updates with respect to our recently closed and announced M&A transactions. Before I get to our results, I want to note that in addition to our earnings press release and customary tables, we have published a supplemental presentation on our website. This presentation provides an operational view of our fiscal 2017 earnings or adjusted earnings excluding unusual items. We exclude from this view charges or related reversals associated with the cost alignment plan that we announced in March 2016. This view also excludes the non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge taken in our EIS business within our technology solutions segment during the second quarter, as well as prior-year gains on the sales of two businesses. Now let’s move to our results for the third quarter. Our adjusted EPS was $3.03 per diluted share. Our adjusted EPS excluding unusual items was for $3.05 per diluted share as we recorded a $0.02 charge related to the cost alignment plan. Now I will review our consolidated results. Consolidated revenues for the third quarter increased 6% in constant currency versus the prior period. Third quarter adjusted gross profit excluding unusual items was down 6% in constant currency year-over-year, driven by the increased competitive customer pricing activity we discussed last quarter. The timing of branded manufacturer inflation and the expected weaker profit contribution from generic manufacturer inflation trends partially offset by our recent business acquisitions and organic growth in our specialty and Canadian businesses. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses excluding unusual items increased 2% in constant currency, driven by recent acquisitions, partially offset by our ongoing cost management efforts. Other income was $26 million for the quarter, an increase of 93% in constant currency, driven primarily by our equity investment in [Indiscernible] a pharmacy operator in the Netherlands. For fiscal 2017, we now expect other income to increase approximately 50% year-over-year. Interest expense of $74 million decreased 15% in constant currency for the quarter, consistent with our prior expectations. We continue to expect interest expense for fiscal 2017 to be down by a mid teen percentage compared to fiscal 2016. Now moving to taxes, our adjusted tax rate was 14.3% for the quarter, driven by the beneficial impact of an inter company sale of software, a mix of income and discreet tax benefits. Expanding on this sale, in December McKesson sold various software and ancillary intellectual property relating to our technology solutions segment to a U.S. based McKesson entity. This sale allows McKesson to claim tax deductions for the fair value of the assets and recognize the resulting tax benefit in our P&L over the estimated remaining lights of the assets. As a result of this sale and excluding the EIS impairment charge taken in the second quarter, we now expect a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 2 4.5%. I want to caution you that fiscal 2017s expected adjusted tax rate is not an indicator of our future expected adjusted tax rate. Going forward, I would expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be closer to 30%. Our income attributable to non controlling interest excluding unusual items was $14 million for the quarter. We now expect income attributable to non-controlling interest to increase approximately 20% from fiscal 2016. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations excluding unusual items totaled $677 million. Our third quarter adjusted EPS excluding unusual items of $3.05 decreased 4% versus the prior year. Wrapping up our consolidated results, during the quarter we completed share repurchases of common stock totaling $2 billion resulting in our diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreasing by 4% year-over-year to $222 million. As a result of the share repurchase activity in the third quarter we now expect our weighted average diluted shares for fiscal 2017 to be approximately $223 million. And we now have $3 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorisation. Let's now turn to the segment results. Distribution Solutions segment constant currency revenues of $49.9 billion were up 6% year-over-year during the quarter. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 5% in constant currency. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6.6 billion for the quarter on a constant currency basis, up 10% driven by acquisitions and market growth. Revenues were impacted by approximately $440 million in unfavorable currency rate movements. Moving now to the Medical-Surgical business, revenues were down 1% for the quarter, driven by the termination of a long term care contract and a weaker impact from the flu season. For Medical Surgical, we now expect low to mid single digit revenue growth in fiscal 2017. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit, excluding unusual items, was down 8% on a constant currency basis for the quarter, driven by the increased competitive customer pricing activity we discussed last quarter. The timing of branded manufacturer inflation and the expected weaker profit contribution from a generic manufacturer inflation trends, partially offset by our recent business acquisitions and organic growth in our specialty and Canadian businesses. Third quarter Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating expenses, excluding unusual items, increased 3% on a constant currency basis. Segment operating expenses reflect an increase related to recently completed acquisitions, partially offset by our cost reduction actions. Distribution Solutions third quarter segment adjusted operating profit, excluding unusual items, was down 23% in constant currency at $815 million. The third quarter segment adjusted operating margin rate, excluding unusual items, was 163 basis points, a decrease of 61 basis points on a constant currency basis driven by the same factors as previously discussed As John mentioned, the segment adjusted operating profit results include two non-recurring charges. Together, these total approximately $68 million. We expect our Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating margin, excluding anticipated cost alignment charges to be approximately 35 to 40 basis points below the corresponding fiscal 2016 figure of 234 basis points. Now moving to Technology Solutions. Revenues were flat for the quarter at $694 million on a constant currency basis, driven by the anticipated decline in our hospital software business, offset by growth in our other technology businesses. Third quarter adjusted segment gross profit excluding unusual items was up 7% on a constant currency basis. Third quarter adjusted segment operating expenses, excluding unusual items, decreased 4% in constant currency from the prior year driven by our ongoing cost management efforts. Adjusted segment operating profit, excluding unusual items, increased 25% in constant currency, resulting in a corresponding adjusted operating margin of 23.92%, up 476 basis points versus the prior year. The increase was driven by growth outside of our hospital software business, and lower operating expenses. We continue to be pleased by the ongoing execution of our technology solution segment as we work to close the change healthcare transaction. I’ll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you’ve heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing including which day of the week marks the close of the given quarter. For receivables, our days’ sales outstanding were little changed at 26 days. Our days sales in inventory decreased two days from the prior year to 31 days, and our days sales in payables increased five days from the prior year to 59 days. The increase in payables days sales relative to the prior year is largely due to a steady increase in our generic pharmaceuticals sourcing scale, and the fact that generic pharmaceuticals have longer payment terms than branded pharmaceuticals. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.4 billion, with approximately $1.8 billion held offshore. For the first nine months of the year, McKesson paid $4.2 billion for acquisitions, repurchased $2 billion in common stock, repaid approximately $390 million in long term debt and spent $369 million on internal capital investments. We now expect property and acquisitions and capitalized software expenses to be between $550 million and $650 million in fiscal 2017. And earlier today, the board of directors approved the quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share. The cash been generated $3.3 billion in cash flow from operations during the first nine months of our fiscal year. In this quarter alone we deployed more than $4 billion on acquisitions and share repurchases. For the full-year, we continue to expect cash flow from operations to increase approximately 15% year-over-year excluding approximately $270 million in cash payments released to the cost alignment plans and the recent settlement with the DEA and DOJ. Now I will focus on our fiscal 2017 outlook. Relative to our prior expectations, our third quarter earnings were favorably impacted by the lower-than-expected tax rates. We now expect a full-year adjusted tax rate excluding the EIS, goodwill impairment charge in the second quarter of a 24.5%, a decrease of 3% points from our prior expectation. In addition, we now expect the weighted average diluted shares for fiscal 2017 to be $223 million following share repurchase activity in the third quarter compared to our previous expectation of $226 million.  These tax and share cap items will drive upside of approximately $0.65 of earnings per diluted share for the full-year. As a reminder, during the third quarter we recorded non-recurring charges that are approximated $60 million which will impact our full-year. And as John discussed, while our pricing of generic pharmaceutical in our independent pharmacy channel has helped us retain share, our pricing is now set at a level lower than our previous expectations. As a result, we expect the profit contribution from these customers will be reduced versus our previous guidance. Regarding the brand manufacturer pricing environment, pricing remained weak in the third quarter as discussed at a recent investor conference. However, we have seen activity in January that is in-line with our previous full-year expectation of mid to high single digit brand manufacturer price inflation. And lastly, we expect our distribution solutions adjusted operating margin excluding anticipated cost alignment charges to be approximately 35 to 40 basis points below the corresponding fiscal 2016 figure of 234 basis points. As a result of these updates, we have raised and narrowed our fiscal 2017 guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share from $12.35 to $12.85 to a new range of $12.60 to $12.90. This range excludes approximately between $1.28 and $1.30 from adjusted earnings driven by the combination of the EIS goodwill impairment charge taken in our second quarter and the anticipated charges during the fiscal year for the cost alignment plan. A list of the key assumptions underpinning our updated fiscal 2017 outlook can be found in the supplemental slide presentation on slide 17 and 18. Before I wrap up my comments on our fiscal 2017 outlook, I also wanted to mention the while not yet a material contributor to our current earnings, we are pleased by the progress we are making in establishing Carrollton our sourcing initiative with Walmart. Now, I would like to take a moment to discuss our recently closed and announced M&A transactions. First, we closed the Rexall transaction in late December. As a reminder, for fiscal 2017 we expect the earnings attributable to Rexall Health will be offset by an anticipated charge related to a fair value adjustment of acquired inventory. Now, moving to our announced acquisition of CoverMyMeds. McKesson has ended into a definitive agreement to acquire CoverMyMeds for approximately $1.1 billion or approximately $900 million net of incremental cash tax benefits. An additional $270 million will be paid if CoverMyMeds reaches certain performance matrix through fiscal 2019. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including end trust approval and is expected to close in the first half of fiscal 2018. We expect the transaction will be funded by a mix of cash and debt. By the third year, following the close of the transaction, we cast an expect attrition of $0.30 to $0.40 to adjusted earnings per diluted share. This transaction will complement our other distribution solutions technology businesses such as a Relay pharmacy and our McKesson pharmacy technology and services business which are both core to executing on our strategy. Given the double digit growth opportunities we see for these businesses, I believe they can drive combined revenues of approximate $1 billion and become a material contributor to McKesson's operation profit growth within three years. Moving now to the pending change healthcare transaction. We expect the transaction will close this quarter and at that time we expect to record a significant one time gain on the contribution of our net assets to change healthcare. This gain will be excluded from our adjusted earnings. In addition, McKesson will receive $1.25 billion of cash at closing. Due to the numerous moving pieces that are involved in the transaction of this kind, we will provide more detailed information following its close. To be clear, McKesson's current fiscal 2017 guidance range of $12.60 to $12.90 assumes a full quarter of MTS earnings. In closing, we are actively engaged in planning for the next fiscal year and we'll provide our fiscal 2018 outlook and underlying assumptions when we announce our fourth quarter earnings in May. Thank you and with that I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others opportunity to participate. Noah?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instruction] Our first question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Jones: Great. Thanks for the question. I guess John I am still struggling on to understand a little bit the magnitude over the last two quarters from the negative impact from branded pricing specifically. If we think about some of the comments previously about 10% to 20% of branded contract being linked to non-fee per service just having trouble bridging the reduction given from the last few quarters. So, I was hoping maybe you could just walk us through a little bit of how we bridge that gap around the EBIT within pharma distribution and the reductions from last quarter and now, this quarters?
John Hammergren: Well, I will turn it over to James to start out though, I think we have done some really good work over the last several years to make sure we have the right balance of fixed compensation and variable compensation for the branded manufacturers and that work continues and I believe now the split of our profit from the branded partners is roughly in that 90:10 kind of a range. So we have reduced the exposure to both the risk and the opportunity here. And but having said that it still remains a material amount of our profitability to your point and we knew that there was going to be some risk in this quarter related to our back-half guidance but we hope that the fourth quarter was going to be stronger than certainly the third quarter in line with the guidance we provided you on the last call. And that's really I think what we are seeing today is that our from full-year perspective based on January we believe we are going to have the back half performance that we had anticipated. James?
James Beer: Yes. I just had that in Q3 the profit contribution from branded manufacturer price inflation was really quite weak. That was real holding back in terms of manufacturers taking price increases and that certainly held was a material driver in our Q3 EPS result. As John saying, we are seeing a different situation playing out in Q4 thus far so our expectation is when you look at the back-half and then the full-year, we are able to continue to forecast what we had said previously about branded inflation being in that mid to high single-digit range. So, certainly a soft Q3 but it appears to be stronger in Q4.
Robert Jones: Great. And I guess just the follow-up related to the reduction in the quarter or the short form a quarter related to pharmaceutical distribution. It sounds like John if I heard you correctly the pricing on independent ended up ultimately being a little bit lower than what you guys has assumed last quarter? I guess what drove this and is there still what you would describe as maybe outside pricing pressure in the marketplace around that customer segment?
John Hammergren: Well, I think you have the first half of that assumption correct. It ended up being a little lower than what we had built into our previous guidance and when the price for our customers was set at the end of the quarter we ended up producing less profitability than we had anticipated but clearly the units we covered and our relationship with our customers improved as we went throughout the quarter. So, I think we have got that issue behind at this point at least today and I think it's just a question of making an estimate early in the quarter when we are still in the process of implementing our reaction to those pockets of increased competition.
James Beer: And then the other day I were just -- reinforced the third quarter that impacted the results were these two non-recurring items that I referred to in my text, the total $60 million in profit contribution. So, that was certainly an important drive as well.
Robert Jones: Got it, thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Velazquez with Bank of America.
Steven Velazquez: Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess just for us, you guys absolutely don't normally break out any sort of operating profit by geography but just thinking about the side the distribution solutions was down by 24% year-over-year in the quarter. Share me the comment at sort of high level from when thinking about US versus Europe. Was the decline in the US more or less than that 24% average and then also just thinking about some of the moving parts in a year or two? I guess we're all just curious how geographically things shook out just between those two when thinking about the average. Thanks.
James Beer: Well, as you mentioned we don't break out the profit by geography. I think the way to think about it is that we had gone into this fiscal year with a view of what might happen from a reimbursement perspective in the UK and then we very quickly realized that UK reimbursement environment was going to be more difficult. And I think ourselves and others talked about the challenge that put in front of us and I think we have done a really good job of now understanding what that effect is on that business and working hard to offset it to grow and to grow through it. I think the thing that became surprise obviously at the end of the year here for us in the back-half was both these onetime items as well as the view that independent generic pricing environment was going to be a bit difficult for us. I don't, I think other than that it's probably difficult for us to provide you more nuance guidance other than cleanly having two markets that are significant to us being negatively impacted simultaneously and then in addition having the inflation environment and brand being below what we had expected at the beginning of the year both played into it weaker than we had expected certainly quarter end and obviously the year as well.
John Hammergren: And I would just add that while obviously we have seen those challenges in the UK market around reimbursement, we haven't seen similar things playing out in other European countries for Celesio, those have been tracking very much along the lines of our expectation during the year.
James Beer: Yes. We are happy with the growth in those markets. I think the team is beginning to expand beyond just sort of the retail pharmacy business into other areas of opportunities or encouraged by that and the acquisitions we have made have been well executed and are delivering that real value. So, we talked about the revenue growth on the call but you look under the covers if you take out the UK reimbursement challenge, the business is performing well.
Steven Velazquez: Okay. I appreciate, just a color, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser: Yes. Good afternoon. So, just turn to a waterfall app on the prepared comments, you talked about the weaker trends on generic inflation but when we think about these trends, where they environment with what you expected when you provided the guidance at the end of the second quarter or in generic deflation environment deteriorated throughout the quarter as well?
James Beer: Well, I'd say couple of things. The way that we have been seeing generic inflation playing out obviously that's on a very small subset of the overall molecule base that has continued to be in line with our expectations very similar, so the story of the last couple of conference calls.
John Hammergren: In terms of the generic deflation environment which is obviously the norm in this part of the marketplace across the across the complete sways of molecules. We continue to gain see nothing as normal here that's having material impact on the business model, so very much adequate system with what we have been saying overall this year.
Ricky Goldwasser: Okay. And then with all the uncertainties around manufacturer's ability to raise brand prices and questions on whether 2nd July price increase can ultimately happen. Since it's shifting all the revenues, see for service and removing this contingency on price is increasingly more relevant. So, one can you talk about where you are in this process. I know John that you have talked about it in your prepared remarks but if you can give some more details. And second of all, if hypothetic be branded manufacturers are after only one price increase in the calendar year, how should we think about this when we model? Should we then model and I know that I'm stealing into 2018 question but should we hypothetically then think about a September core is where good profits would be down 10% year-over-year if no price increases happen this quarter? Just conceptually how should we be thinking about that and how we can assess that kind of like embedded risk or that bare case scenario?
James Beer: Well, I think to your first part of your question, we are working actively with the manufacturers to make sure that we have our line of sight to the economics that are appropriate for the service that we provide. I think the manufacturers very much appreciate the work that we do and certainly have a willingness to fund our business model and to help us manage their business in a way that's more efficient frankly for them. And so, we are excited to continue to play that role. And with many of our manufacturer relationships, our economics have been properly set for a long time in the vehicle that we have been using to be paid. And that is risky as a price increase vehicle might be as the method by which we would be paid the piece that we deserve. And so, to your point, to the extent that we have been dependent on price increases as a funding mechanism with a manufacturer who is no longer on their own taking those price increases will certainly go back to them and because of that behavior change, worked and negotiated a relationship that gives us as I said our compensation. On the second front, it was difficult for us to predict when manufacturers are going to have price increases. Whether they are going to have one or two or more, what the rate of increase will be, are they say going to, if they say they're going to have one and they are going to have all the ones at the same time or are they going to have multiple on these products at different times of year or different products at different times during the year. So, I think it is a little bit of black box to your point. From a modeling perspective, it's probably a little premature for us to give you a view as to how we are going to think about the quarterly progression of our profitability and clearly when we are on our conference call in May to the extend we have better visibility we will try to help you not only understand that the risk we still have in our model which we try to outline at the beginning of every fiscal year with our assumptions but we'll try to also try to help you understand how price increase behavior quarter-to-quarter may create variability or risk.
Ricky Goldwasser: Okay, thank you.
James Beer: Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from Garen Sarafian with Citi.
Garen Sarafian: Good afternoon John, James. Following-up on a prior question regarding independent pharmacy price and to further clarify, could you discuss the current market alignment that you are seeing. So, has pricing stabilized, was any of the downside related to additional actions by either the competitors or which was just your only in the midst of the process we made an estimate or any other factor that you could elaborate on, would be appreciated.
John Hammergren: Clearly we have great visibility to our customers demand from us and we have a great visibility to the mix of products that they order and just the relationship overall. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, with our customer base, we saw our recovery in both units and frankly added to it related to their long-term partnership with us and we've retained our relationship and our business for those stores. That's an indication that the pricing decision that we made in the quarter and talked about in the previous call was appropriate and then the price that we set at the end of the process in the quarter was the appropriate price otherwise we would have not seen that customer retention or that unit recovery. So, I hesitate to say that pricing isn't a fluid environment but we typically don't see these large pockets of price competition in our basic customers and we seemed to have resolved that with the actions we took earlier in the quarter. And I think lastly what I would say is that I think the estimate we made early was more informed as we got through the process and it was more of an estimate as we started the process and so to answer your question about continued heightened or unusual competition in our independent customer base we believe has largely subsided because of the actions we take.
Garen Sarafian: That's useful. And then a follow-up on the branded drug that you mentioned that you are now at 90 ton breakout. So, within that 90% that fee for service, do you typically build in any flexibility into those types of contracts where you be relatively not that to either net or gross pricing or any cause to revisit the contracts, certain situations occur?
John Hammergren: First of all, I'd like to maybe clarify a point about the contracts being 90:10 as opposed to the income being 90:10. So, when James and I talk about 90:10 ratio on profit from branded manufacturer, that's really how the dollars result out of those relationships. We shouldn't take it to mean that 90% of our contracts are fixed and 10% of our contracts aren't.
Garen Sarafian: Absolutely, I misspoke. Correct.
John Hammergren: And secondly, we have an ongoing discussion with our partners as you might imagine. And it is a good relationship and I believe that the dollar value of the service we provide is where our conversations typically are focused. Now it's obviously drive by a multiple of revenue or throughput through our business but the dollars are what fund are activity. And so, if there were to be a dramatic change in the way our partners price their products and your description is going from the gross price to a net of rebates price, we clearly would only be happy if we could cover the same dollar result out of that new matrix as opposed to a different kind of relationship. So, I think that the likelihood of that happening number one is slim and second if it were to happen we currently would actively renegotiate our contracts to create a mirror image result that we have today with the different set of multipliers or factories involved. At least that’s where I would attempt to reconcile.
Garen Sarafian: That's very useful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa Gill: Thanks very much. Good afternoon, John and James. James let me just start with the first question around the non-recurring items that you called out for $60 million. 1) Did I just miss all the commentary what they are for 2) and if they were included in this quarter does that help to explain the progression as we get into your guidance for or the implied guidance for drug distribution in the fourth quarter?
James Beer: So, the $60 million with the two items recorded in Q3, so yes that's the an important element in bridging through to the full-year guide. So, that is something I particularly do want to emphasize. That's correct.
Lisa Gill: Can you tell us or give us little more color what they were for?
James Beer: One was a resolution of a customer contract that had related to a variety of years going back in time so certainly something that I think of as a onetime type item. And the other was an accounting reserve that we believe was appropriate to take again around receivables in the certain segment of the business within distribution solutions. So we feel as though we are being appropriately conservative around those reserves.
Lisa Gill: Okay, great. And then just to think about a topic as we think about going into the fourth quarter John, you discussed a ton around this in your dynamic, in the independent market but I just want to make sure that I understand in the third quarter we saw all the pricing impact so when we think about this progression from the third quarter to the fourth quarter independent stays the same the pricing on branded looks a little bit better because it's coming in within your expectations versus the third quarter was below we don't have these onetime items as we go into the fourth quarter and I think that you commented also again correct me if I am wrong that generic price deflation is also roughly within your expectations, but we also see [Claris 1] start to impact the numbers in that fourth quarter?
John Hammergren: Pretty a good bunch of questions Lisa, but let me start, I will have James jump in if I miss something. Clearly there might be a little bit of a tail of continued lap negative on the independent pricing just because as I mentioned our estimate on the last call was slightly higher than where it actually netted when we set the price and that netting process probably left us a month or weeks off in the full quarter effects in Q3 if that makes sense to you. As you go into Q4 there is a little missing hole there on that net price affect on the independent business. The branded price inflation I think that is, what’s early in this quarter to call it but I would say that we believe that on the back half guide for branded price inflation we are going to be in pretty good shape. We didn't have much in our expectations around generic price increases and then we had these onetime items that James referred to a few moments ago. James.
James Beer: And in Claris 1, I wouldn't expect that to be material contributor in Q4. I think that will help us in FY 18. 
Lisa Gill: Okay great. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.
George Hill: Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. I know this hasn't come up yet, well it has come up, but James can you quantify or I guess provide any kind of sense of severity around what was the step down in the [selfie] pricing versus what you thought was at the end of fiscal 2Q versus where it came in the end of fiscal Q3?
James Beer: I am not again to sort of offer a specific guide around that as John was alluding to the expect, it's going to be at the sort of the full run rate in Q4 and we saw significant majority of that same effect in Q3, but there was a certain movement downward during the quarter after we had last spoken to you on this call.
George Hill: Okay. And then maybe just kind of a quick follow-up on just kind of one more on this topic is that if most of the impact was observed in fiscal Q3, I guess fiscal Q2, Q3 and Q4 then there is - there is a little bit of lapping impact that takes place early in fiscal ’18 and then it's kind of fully behind us from a comp perspective. I want to make sure that I am not missing something either in the contracting methodology or in the pricing methodology or the pricing impact of this is able to be contained and then margins expand again it's kind of the pricing that’s, the pricing is occurred with the segment of the market that those profits have kind of been extracted here and have been passed through the customer. That's not something that returns to us?
John Hammergren: So, I would expect the lapping effect that you are referring to in the first half of the year just a little bit into A Q3 as well because system was what I was saying just a moment ago.
James Beer: And George, I think some people probably don't fully understand that we priced the generics, every day we are pricing generics. So to forecast where the generic profitability will for our customer base next year is probably difficult. Obviously, Clais 1 will have an effect on us from a buying perspective and we set our sell prices on the generic space so that our customer get a competitive price and a fair price but that is a bit of a moving target I don't want you to think that our pricing has been “locked in” and sometime form us a lake way, it really is responsive to market conditions.
George Hill: Okay that's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.
Ross Muken: Hi, good afternoon. So I realize you are not going to give us details on 2018 in terms of guidance in general. But, from a methodology standpoint given the volatility we’ve had in results this year and given some of the challenges in forecasting some of the specific factors, is there any thoughts just sort of whether it’s from a transparency or in terms of other things you all give us sort of help understand the trajectory. Any thoughts on sort of the methodology of whether or not you intend to sort of guide as you typically do and provide many of the same metrics or do you think now that with some high data is there other things we should be looking at to get a better sense. Because it does feel like there is a lot going on in the business right now. It's kind of hard to ascertain Q to Q kind of the flow of where profits are going?
John Hammergren: I am certainly sympathetic to the difficultly in terms of understanding the dynamics of our business. I think that I will let James jump in here little bit on the whole forecasting and what we might provide you in terms of view as we get into next fiscal year. I will say however that the business is always complex and they are lots of moving parts to it and they always have the lots and moving parts. The challenge that we have this fiscal year in particular is it that the moving parts are moving negative on us simultaneously and usually you have things that are offsetting in the business so we don't end up with as you said the challenge and forecasting because we have generally offset some of the negative things with more positive things and unfortunately this year we haven't had that type of dynamic.
James Beer: Yes, I would just add that obviously was still going through however FY 18 planning process. As I think about the discussions we have had on these three conference calls of this fiscal year obviously we’ve ended up having to talk about different things in a more detailed manner to be able lay out the underlying drivers of the results and we will take that perspective into how we think about discussing our guide as well. So I think that does logically expand the variables that we have traditionally talked about when we have done the May earnings calls just because we have been expanding all the discussions during the last three conference calls with you.
Ross Muken: And that’s helpful perspective and I guess obviously executing quite a bit share repurchase in the quarter you saw quite a bit outstanding but you also have a lot of cash cutting in and you have the proceeds from change I mean obviously you guys have always done a portfolio approach. Is there any bias to share repurchase medium term still just given where the stock is and how you compare that to kind of the external opportunities or you still see a ton in the pipeline that you feel like it can give you more superior returns than buying your own stock today?
James Beer: Well, we certainly continue to light the portfolio approach to capital allocation that we have deployed for a number of years. Obviously in the last quarter, we did a goodly amount of both M&A as represented by the rightful transaction as well as share buyback. Today we have announced the acquisition of Cover my meds. So, I think that's an illustrative we continue to see opportunities to deploy capital to M&A that we believe can generate long term cash flow profit growth and build the strategic capability of the company. That said, we aptly through the cash flow generation and that's of course giving us more flexibility to take advantage as I think we have in this last quarter with a quite large share buyback action. At a time we are not stocks trading at a relatively low multiple.
Ross Muken: Great, thanks James.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with UBS.
Michael Cherny: Good afternoon guys. Most of my questions have been answered, but I think there was a question while back around your conversations with manufacturers and how that's changing the [indiscernible] changing pricing dynamics. I guess John, overtime you mentioned the relationship you guys have, is a value for value rationale, you guys are true partners. As you think going forward, as you go back to have these conversations, what are the key selling points that you are focused on offering them particularly environment where these manufacturers continue to get questions about their pricing environment and how do you think about the incremental value proposition above and beyond what you guys have done for the last 10-20-30 or 100-80 years with these various different companies?
John Hammergren: Well clearly, we are trying to build our capabilities so to your point the value proposition we delivered to them hopefully year in and year out is increasing in value. And frankly the Cover my meds discussion we had in the beginning of this call is a very positive example of where we are deploying capital to help our manufacturers particularly the branded manufacturers the revenue side of their P&L which frankly is probably a lot more important to them then the basis point side of their P&L where they pay us and I think that - the ability for us to get people on their meds to reduce the friction associated with getting prescription filled and to keep people on their meds after they have been prescribed and to reduce the administrative cost associated with payers and pharmacies dealing with patients and physicians who are trying to get prescriptions filled will be very helpful and has proven to be very helpful. And clearly, we have done the same thing on our U.S. oncology business where we are no longer just necessarily a commodity wholesaler trying to sell oncology products, but we are a company that can truly partner with the physician to change the character of their practice and the profitability of their practice. So, you will see us continue to do that and on the specific issue of the fee structure with manufacturers, clearly if we have been working alongside them for years and developed a relationship around being paid through price inflation, I think it's fair for us to go back and ask them when they have changed their behavior not related to us to go back to them and ask them to pay us a different way if they are no longer going to use our price increases as the funding mechanism for their wholesale relationship. So, we are going to be successful as rapidly as we want and we are going to be 100% successful not yet to be seen but that clearly is our objective adding more value and making sure that we strike a bargain where they can feel fair the composition we have asked for is fair.
Michael Cherny: Thanks John. I know, it’s odd time, so I appreciate the color.
John Hammergren: You are welcome.
Operator: We will take our next question from Robert Willoughby with Credit Suisse.
Robert Willoughby: Just a quick one for James, you mentioned that you would comment on the changed healthcare transaction upon closing. Is that sometime inter-quarter as you mentioned or will the comments really on the guidance and the contribution come with the May conference call?
James Beer: No, I would expect that we will be closing the transaction during this quarter and it will be appropriate to update you at that time.
Robert Willoughby: Okay, press release then and call or just press release?
James Beer: Well, I am not sort of those details, so it maybe a press release. We will see how things play out in the next three or four weeks.
John Hammergren: And certainly, we don't have a public call. Obviously, the IR team is available to help address questions if it's not clear from the press release.
Robert Willoughby: Perfect. Thank you.
John Hammergren: I want to thank you, I know, for your help today and I want to thank all of you on the call for your time today. We continue to focus on the success of our customers and the value we deliver everyday and we look forward to updating you on our fiscal 2018 outlook when we provide you our fourth quarter earnings results in May. So thank you and good-bye.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Mr. Craig Mercer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.
Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.: Thank you, Noah. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson fiscal 2017 second quarter earnings call. I am joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO, and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update, and then James will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour, at 6:00 PM Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, John and James will reference adjusted earnings, which excludes four items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, claim and litigation reserve adjustments, and LIFO-related adjustments.

Please refer to our press release announcing second quarter fiscal 2017 results and the supplemental slides for further information and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thank you. And here's John Hammergren.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thanks, Craig, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Before I jump into our second quarter results, I'd like to take a few moments to frame our discussion today, as events impacting our second quarter results have implications for our outlook for Fiscal 2017. Let's start with our revised Fiscal 2017 outlook. In particular, we now provide an update to our expectation of a lower profit contribution, resulting from recent customer pricing activities, and lower operating profit as a result of further moderating branded pharmaceutical inflation trends, compared to previous expectations, both of which affect our U.S. pharmaceutical business within Distribution Solutions. As a result of these updates, we now expect $12.35 to $12.85 per diluted share, which excludes from adjusted earnings a goodwill impairment charge in our Enterprise Information Solutions business, which James will cover in his comments, as well as estimated charges related to our cost alignment plan that was previously announced in March of 2016. As we built our plan and entered Fiscal 2017, we assumed some moderation around drug inflation activity. In particular, we commented on our expectation for a nominal contribution from generic pharmaceuticals that increase in price. We also commented that our expectation that branded pharmaceutical price trends would be modestly below those experienced in fiscal 2016. First generic price inflation has been largely in line with our original assumption. However, customer pricing and branded inflation continue to evolve. In our first quarter, we witnessed some evidence of inflation and pricing softness in line with our original assumptions. However, this softness became much more pronounced in our second quarter, first around brand inflation and later, around customer pricing. While we generally do not provide specific assumptions around customer pricing activity, we do operate in a competitive environment. And though competitive, we've always been focused on delivering value to our customers, value not just defined by price, but by service, innovation that helps our customers partner, manage, and run their operations, and manage their capital more effectively, and innovation that helps our customers connect with patients in a more informed and intimate way. Now, price is always a consideration. We provide our customers with premium value through our superior service and innovation, for which we expect to get an appropriate price. We believe that delivering premium value builds more sustainable customer relationships and long-term shareholder value. Generally speaking, we anticipate pockets of increased competitive activity as part of our normal course of business. What we began to see more recently is competitive activity that is broader than our original expectations, more aggressive, and across several areas of our U.S. pharmaceutical business. As I've mentioned in the past, McKesson manages pricing on a centralized basis, although I think all of our customers believe we've been charging fairly for the service we provide and are willing to pay for this service. When a competitor significantly undercuts our existing pricing, we are compelled to respond. And although we cannot be absolutely assured that recent price concessions will address the recent heightened competitiveness fully, we believe our responses have been appropriate and measured. We remain committed to our careful and thoughtful approach to customer pricing, and to the value we deliver to help differentiate our customers' capabilities and performance, relative to their competitors. We believe the services we provide to both our provider customers and our manufacturer customers offer substantially greater value than what either party could develop with a more direct relationship. And we expect that with our focus on the value we deliver, our margins will recover over time. As for branded inflation, I suspect many of you have tracked the evolving conversation in the U.S. Last month, James highlighted concerns we had around some manufacturers appearing to delay some price increases we would have otherwise anticipated, based on their historical and our historical experience. What we have seen this year to-date, our fewer products with price increases, and those price increases are at lower rates than both prior year results and our expectations for the current fiscal year. Given our second quarter performance specific to branded price inflation, we now expect full-year branded pharmaceutical pricing trends to be meaningfully below those experienced in Fiscal 2016. Let me spend a minute and talk about how we are compensated for branded pharmaceutical product distribution services. Today, all of our contracts with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers are individually negotiated, but generally, are constructed around charging for the service we provide. In almost all cases, the charge is derived as a percent of revenue managed and delivered by McKesson for that specific manufacturer. These charges vary not only by manufacturer, but also by the service requirement at the product level. Clearly, revenue-based fees are all affected at some level by inflation. However, in some cases the benefit from inflation is greater, given the specifics and the characteristics of individual contracts, and a specific behavior of the manufacturers that are our party to these agreements. So although a large majority of our compensation is relatively easy to forecast, inflation-based income derived from these relationships can impact our results on a more variable basis. Through these agreements, speculative buying or buying large quantities of product in front of anticipated price increases no longer exist. Essentially, all of McKesson's pharmaceutical purchases are done in partnership with the manufacturer, unlike the industry standard practice years ago, before any contracts presided over the relationships between wholesalers and their manufacturer partners. These changes that happened years ago have translated into more stable inventory levels that are appropriate to meet the customer demands and service levels. So the takeaway here is that branded inflation still plays a meaningful role, and in some cases, it can be an important part of our overall compensation with specific manufacturers, and we can be impacted by their decisions, relative to price increases. Although some contracts with manufacturers may not have specific compensation elements tied to product price changes, our internal branded price inflation assumptions often appear to be directionally aligned with externally published data. But the mix matters. So even relatively small changes in behavior could have a more or less impact on our results, depending on the characteristics of that individual manufacturer contract. We'd like to think we do a superior job of exceeding the expectations of these partners, so there should be even some variability in our industry related to results driven by brand and generic inflations. So what does all of this mean moving forward? It means we expect to receive less compensation from branded price increases than we originally anticipated in fiscal 2017. It means we will continue to monitor pricing activities throughout the year, especially in our fiscal fourth quarter, which is typically an important quarter for price increases. And it means we are engaging with our manufacturer partners to ensure we receive appropriate compensation, relative to the services and value we deliver, amidst a softer pricing environment. Now, turning to our revised outlook for fiscal 2017. We expect the combination of recent competitive pricing and further moderating branded price increase activity will have a combined negative effect on our business by approximately $1.60 to $1.90 per diluted share, versus our July fiscal 2017 outlook, with a larger impact coming from competitive pricing. Turning now back to our second quarter results. In the interest of time, I'll hit a few key themes, and then, we'll hand the call over to James to cover our financial performance. Let me start with the progress we've made on integrating the several acquisitions we closed last quarter, as well as early progress on Sainsbury's, which we closed at the beginning of September. These are important strategic investments that are tracking to our expectations, and contributing positively to our financial performance. We were especially pleased by the stronger-than-expected performance of our Biologics acquisition, which is an important offering to our manufacturing partners in the rapidly growing oncology specialty pharmacy market. Turning now to some highlights within Distribution Solutions segment for the quarter. Our sourcing partnership with Walmart is progressing well. We made considerable progress to date in our efforts to establish the new sourcing function, and we are on track to realize benefits from this new venture in fiscal 2018. We remain confident in our assumption that we will service the Rite Aid business through our current fiscal year given that the acquisition by Walgreens is still pending. We will continue to follow the progress of this transaction as well as any new developments around the opportunity to serve any of the acquired or divested stores. We are making a fundamental change to the structure in terms of our relationship with both providers and manufacturers as it relates to hundreds of specialty products. We are charging separately for the supply chain value we add across a wide array of product categories and manufacturers. Our conversations with customers and suppliers around specialty pricing are proceeding as expected, and we are pleased with the responses we are receiving. I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the great work from our U.S. pharmaceutical teams that support our customers every day. We started the fiscal year with the successful onboarding of the Albertsons-Safeway network, another successful ideaShare conference with our independent retail pharmacy customers. And in the second quarter, Health Mart stores were ranked highest overall in customer satisfaction among chain drug pharmacies across the U.S. in the J.D. Power 2016 Pharmacy Satisfaction Study. It's great to see recognition for the positive experiences patients receive every day in these pharmacies. Turning now to our international pharmaceutical distribution and services. As we mentioned in our earnings call last quarter, reimbursement cuts imposed by the UK government to retail pharmacy rates as well as the UK's decision to exit the EU have unfavorably impacted Celesio's operating performance. Despite these headwinds, I'm encouraged by the significant progress we've made to help shape the long-term opportunities we expect are available to us across the European markets in which we operate. In addition to our internal focus strategy, such as Six Sigma training and the standard ERP platform across our many geographies, we are engaged with external stakeholders in productive discussions around services we can offer to state-run health systems, where wholesalers today often play a limited role, or expanding the services a retail pharmacy may deliver to its customers. We continue to make good progress on further developing our opportunities in our European markets. As for our other Distribution Solutions businesses, such as McKesson Specialty Health, McKesson Canada, Medical-Surgical, they're all performing very well, showing strong growth and profitability, including double-digit adjusted operating profit growth year-over-year for all of these businesses in Q2. Turning now to Technology Solutions. I'm encouraged by the exceptional performance from our Technology Solutions team, even with considerable distractions to support the creation of a new company with Change Healthcare, this segment delivered solid results. We continue to make steady progress across Technology Solutions in support of a strong future with Change Healthcare, while managing the work to retain the Relay Pharmacy business and prepare the EIS business for strategic alternatives. In Q2, we recorded a material non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to EIS. As you may recall, we are considering strategic alternatives for EIS, which is part of our broader Technology Solutions strategy that we unveiled earlier this year. Our commitment has been and will always be to the long-term value creation for our customers, employees and shareholders, and we are confident in the direction we are headed with our Technology Solutions businesses. Now to wrap up my comments. We've spoken for a few quarters about how generics inflation and customer consolidation challenges that we identified last year, which were incorporated into our fiscal 2017 outlook. We've effectively lapped these items at this point in time. However, we recently experienced new challenges around pricing softness in the form of increased competitive pricing activity and lower branded inflation, which I discussed a few moments ago. These new challenges resulted in a lower fiscal second quarter result and a revision to our previous full-year outlook for fiscal 2017 of a $13.43 to $13.93 old range to a new range of $12.35 to $12.85. Our business remains structurally sound. We are in the right businesses in the right markets and we bring scale and efficiency to all stakeholders. Our leadership team and I met with each of our business unit leaders earlier this month. These visits reinforce my conviction that we have the best people in the business making the right decisions every day to help our customers lead the change across the healthcare system we serve. We consider it an honor to serve in this capacity and, clearly, our people have the passion necessary to lead through change. The quality and ingenuity of our team give me great confidence in our future. We have a strong balance sheet and robust cash flow generation. We are extremely well-positioned to deploy capital and deliver value for our shareholders through a combination of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. And we're pleased to announce earlier today an increase of $4 billion to our existing share repurchase authorization. With that, I'll turn the call over to James and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Thank you, John. And good afternoon, everyone. Today I will first discuss our fiscal 2017 outlook and then review our second quarter results. In addition, I will provide more information related to the pending Change Healthcare transaction prior to John and I taking your questions. Before I get to our outlook, I want to note that in addition to our earnings press release and customary tables, we have published a supplemental presentation on our website. This presentation provides an operational view of our fiscal 2017 earnings or adjusted earnings excluding unusual items. We exclude from this view the non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge taken in our EIS business within our Technology Solutions segment during the second quarter as well as charges or related reversals associated with the cost alignment plan we announced in March 2016. This view also excludes prior-year gains on the sales of two businesses. To expand on these unusual items, in the second quarter, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $290 million or $1.24 per diluted share associated with our EIS business. Also, in the second quarter, we recorded pre-tax credits of $10 million or $0.02 per diluted share related to the cost alignment plan. Now I will focus on our fiscal 2017 outlook. As John discussed earlier, based on our reported earnings and expectations for the remainder of the year, we have lowered our fiscal 2017 guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share from $13.43 to $13.93 to a new range of $12.35 to $12.85. This new range excludes approximately $1.31 to $1.33 from adjusted earnings driven by the combination of the EIS goodwill impairment charge and anticipated charges during the fiscal year for the cost alignment plan. Our revised outlook includes the impacts of competitive customer pricing and softness in brand inflation that John just discussed. We expect these two headwinds to drive a combined reduction of between approximately $1.60 and $1.90 to our fiscal 2017 adjusted EPS. We expect the larger of the two impacts to be driven by more competitive pricing. These headwinds will be partially offset by a number of items including savings from ongoing cost management efforts, lower interest expense, a lower tax rate and the effects of our ongoing capital deployment. A listing of the key assumptions underpinning our fiscal 2017 outlook can be found in the supplemental slide presentation on slides 17 and 18. I will not take you through each key assumption on this call. However, I would like to draw your attention to the following significant updates to our revised outlook. We now expect the Distribution Solutions adjusted operating margin, excluding anticipated cost alignment charges, to be approximately 30 basis points to 40 basis points below the fiscal 2016 adjusted operating margin, excluding unusual items of 234 basis points. We now expect our interest expense to be down by a mid-teen percentage compared to fiscal 2016. We also expect a full year adjusted tax rate, excluding the EIS goodwill impairment charge of approximately 27.5%, which may vary from quarter to quarter. Weighted average diluted shares used in the calculation of earnings per share are expected to be approximately 226 million for the year. And as a reminder, given the expected timing of the close of the transaction with Change Healthcare, we are not currently assuming that the creation and operation of the new company will impact our fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share. As it relates to the progression of our fiscal 2017 results, we expect that our second half results will be more weighted to our fourth quarter. While we are lowering our guidance today, we are promptly taking steps to address the industry headwinds that we have identified. For example, our cost alignment plan and additional ongoing cost management initiatives continue to bring savings to the company and position us well for future growth. And I am pleased by our strong operating cash flow generation in the first half of the year. For the full year, we continue to expect cash flow from operations to increase approximately 15% year-over-year, excluding approximately $270 million in cash payments related to the cost alignment plan and the settlement agreement with the DEA and DOJ. For the balance of fiscal 2017, we expect to continue to deploy capital in line with all four elements of our portfolio approach. Now, let's move to our results for the second quarter. Our adjusted EPS was $1.72 per diluted share. Our adjusted EPS excluding unusual items was $2.94 per diluted share. As a reminder, our second quarter fiscal 2016 adjusted EPS of $3.31 per diluted share included a $0.14 gain on the sale of the ZEE Medical business. For comparison purposes, our second quarter adjusted EPS excluding unusual items was $3.17. Now, I will review our consolidated results. Consolidated revenues for the second quarter increased 3% in constant currency. Second quarter adjusted gross profit excluding unusual items was down 6% in constant currency year-over-year, driven by the expected weaker profit contribution from generic inflation trends and the impact of previously disclosed customer consolidation activity and lower compensation from a branded manufacturer, partially offset by our recent business acquisitions and global procurement benefits. Further, as I previously discussed, we also saw softness in certain branded manufacturer pricing activity and, more recently, increased competitive customer pricing activity. Second quarter adjusted operating expenses, excluding unusual items, decreased 1% in constant currency, reflecting actions taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 related to our cost alignment plan as well as ongoing cost management efforts. Adjusted other income was $25 million for the quarter, an increase of 47% in constant currency consistent with our fiscal 2017 guidance. Interest expense of $78 million decreased 14% in constant currency for the quarter. Now moving to taxes. Adjusted tax rate excluding the EIS goodwill impairment charge was 25.4%, driven by our mix of income and multiple discrete tax benefits. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations, excluding certain items, totaled $669 million. Our second quarter adjusted EPS excluding unusual items of $2.94 decreased 7% versus the prior year. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 3% year-over-year to 228 million. Let's now turn to the segment results. Distribution Solutions segment constant currency revenues of $49.6 billion were up 3% year-over-year during the quarter. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 2% in constant currency. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6.6 billion for the quarter on a constant currency basis, up 12% driven by acquisitions and market growth. Revenues were impacted by approximately $305 million in unfavorable currency rate movements. Moving now to the Medical-Surgical business, revenues were up 4% for the quarter driven by growth in our primary care business, partially offset by the prior year sale of the ZEE Medical business. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit, excluding unusual items, was down 6% on a constant currency basis for the quarter, consistent with my previous comments. Second quarter Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating expenses, excluding unusual items, increased 2% on a constant currency basis. Segment operating expenses reflect an increase in expenses related to recently completed acquisitions, substantially offset by our cost reduction actions. Distribution Solutions second quarter segment adjusted operating profit, excluding unusual items, was down 15% in constant currency at $933 million. The second quarter segment adjusted operating margin rate, excluding unusual items, was 188 basis points, a decrease of 40 basis points on a constant currency basis driven by the same factors as previously discussed. Technology Solutions revenues were down 6% for the quarter to $680 million on a constant currency basis, driven by the anticipated decline in our hospital software business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses. Second quarter adjusted segment gross profit excluding unusual items was down 7% on a constant currency basis. Second quarter adjusted segment operating expenses, excluding unusual items, decreased 6% in constant currency from the prior year driven by our cost reduction actions. Adjusted segment operating profit, excluding unusual items, decreased 10% in constant currency, resulting in an adjusted operating margin excluding unusual items of 20.74%, down 104 basis points relative to the prior year. The reduction was driven primarily by the expected decline of our hospital software business, partially offset by lower operating expenses. I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding are flat from the prior year at 26 days. Our days sales in inventory decreased two days from the prior year to 29 days, and our days sales in payables increased six days from the prior year to 59 days. The increase in days sales in payables relative to the prior year is largely due to a steady increase in our generic pharmaceuticals sourcing scale, and the fact that generic pharmaceuticals have longer payment terms than branded pharmaceuticals. We generated $2.9 billion in cash flow from operations during the first half of our fiscal year. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $5.5 billion, with $2.9 billion held offshore. In the first half of the year, McKesson paid $2 billion for acquisitions and spent $240 million on internal capital investments. And earlier today, the board of directors approved the quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share, and authorized a new $4 billion share repurchase program. Now, moving to our announced transaction with Change Healthcare. While the transaction has not yet closed, and McKesson and Change Healthcare continue to operate as separate companies, we wanted to provide some updates and clarity around how the transaction will impact McKesson upon a successful closing. We continue to be optimistic that the transaction will close in the first half of calendar year 2017. The assets and liabilities being contributed to NewCo have been reclassified as held for sale as of September 30, 2016. In addition, we expect that our 70% equity ownership contribution from NewCo will be reported in the other income line. This line item will reflect the pre-tax equity income from our share of NewCo. At the time of the close of the transaction, McKesson is anticipated to record a significant one-time gain on the divestiture and related contribution of our net assets to NewCo. Next, I'd like to address the drivers that I previously mentioned that will have an impact on McKesson's EPS results when the transaction closes. First, NewCo will be servicing approximately $6.1 billion of debt with an interest rate of approximately 5% to 7%, thus driving higher interest expense estimated to be between approximately $210 million and $300 million year-over-year, after accounting for our 70% share of NewCo's earnings. Second, as is customary with transactions involving technology companies, we will record fair value adjustments to the contributed businesses deferred revenue, which we expect to reduce reported earnings year-over-year by approximately $150 million to $200 million, after adjusting for our 70% portion of NewCo's earnings. Please note that the deferred revenue range I have provided today is sensitive to our fiscal year-end sales activity. Assuming that the transaction closes on April 1, 2017, the combination of financing costs and accounting-related fair value adjustments is expected to drive between approximately $1.10 and $1.30 in fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS dilution, which will be partially offset by an operating profit benefit, including the first-year synergies from our 70% portion of NewCo's earnings. This benefit will be higher than the amount that the MTS contributed assets would have generated absent our transaction with Change Healthcare. While this transaction will initially impact our adjusted EPS, we continue to believe that the creation of NewCo is very much in the best interest of our shareholders. Working with Change Healthcare, we will drive significant customer and financial synergies. In addition, we have a strong partner in Blackstone with a shared focus on value creation, an agreed-upon path to an IPO and a plan that allows us to exit the investment in a tax-efficient manner. In closing, while we are currently being adversely impacted by multiple market conditions, our talented team focus on both gross profit initiatives and the expense management, strong cash flow generation and balance sheet flexibility underpin the confidence we have in our business. Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Noah?
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: Good afternoon. So, John, having been covering this company a long time, I can't recall the last time we had a discussion on competitive pricing. And so, I guess what do you think caused that part of the environment to change over the last three or six months? And obviously, the magnitude that you've given is quite large, and so it's a fairly substantial change. Obviously, we're seeing a lot of different constituents talk about drug pricing and all sorts of other things, but this seems actually unrelated. And so help us just understand, one, what you think caused this, how you think the industry will then respond and hopefully heal. And then, secondarily, on your end, I guess how we should put this into context of what has happened historically, if there's anything that you would compare this to.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Let me start with that, Ross. I have seen this, obviously, throughout my career. But we also saw it at McKesson that where, in particular, we took a step function down with pricing. You may recall, I think in the early part of 2008, we had talked publicly about a significant price-related challenge that we are facing now. It happened that year that we were able to fill the margin hole created from that stair step through a unique opportunity to be the sole provider of the H1N1 flu vaccine back then. And that gave us a stream of profitability that allowed us to grow through that challenge. So it does happen from time to time. You'd have to really probably ask the companies involved in it as to why they would pursue price. I can tell you that McKesson doesn't believe you can build sustainable relationships with customers or value for shareholders with a price-oriented approach. And I know that at least one company in our sector has been pretty public about growing revenues above market and about regaining market share, particularly in the independent space. And so I think that certainly people have different motives perhaps to grow their business beyond the market. I would tell you that what McKesson's been focused on, as we've talked about year in and year out, is the expansion of the service we provide our customers and the value that we deliver to create those relationships and expand our margins while we do so. And margin growth comes from solid relationships that are built over time. And from time to time, those relationships can be challenged if the price differential between where the customer perceives the market price to be and what we're asking for become disconnected. So it has happened before. We covered through those periods of time. And like I said, I don't think a price-oriented approach to market share is something that's stable in the end anyway.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: That was helpful. Thanks, John.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.
George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. And John, you may have just spoken to it because you called out the pricing pressure, and I wanted to see if you could comment on which market sub-segments are you seeing the pricing pressure the most. It seems like you spoke to independents, but also is it in the independents and the franchisees and the big boxes? I guess any more color on the pricing pressure would be helpful.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, thanks for the question, George. I think the most acute area right now is in our independent segment. And clearly, that's a place where you have lots of customers that had long-term relationships, but they also can be fluid. And I think what we've tried to say today is that we plan to maintain our share positions and to grow our business on the value we deliver. And that's really what we're after. The rest of our segments are always competitive, but this is the most material impact we've seen in some time.
George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just my only follow-up would be from a quantification perspective. You gave us the basis point impact. But is there a way to think about the magnitude of the pricing change in that segment that you're seeing? Quantify that. I'm sorry.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Yeah, I think James talked a little bit about the reduction in our expectations and how that split with a larger portion really coming from the price pressure we feel. And so that gives you a sense for the magnitude. And clearly, the independent segment for us is a very valuable and important franchise and we have a lot of business there. So I think that between those comments, you should really get a sense directionally for the size of the challenge.
George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Yeah.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much. John, just looking at the industry, my understanding was always that a bigger component of your margin actually came from the manufacturers versus the customer relationships. So can you talk about what's happening on that side of your business? And our understanding has been that inventory management agreements cover 80% or 85%. What are you seeing in that other 15% to 20%? Is that having a direct correlation on what you're seeing as far as the reduction in earnings as well?
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Right. There really are two factors, and I'll have James talk a little bit about the manufacturers in a minute. Because that obviously, when we talk about brand price inflation trends and we tried to quantify once again in our prepared comments how much of this challenge we had this quarter and the forecast for year is coming from that component, we do have some variability that resides in that part of our business. Clearly, the manufacturers that play a very important role for us, and we're constantly working with the manufacturers to make sure that we've identified the value that we deliver and that we're properly reimbursed for that value and we plan to continue to do so. On the customer side, it's not unimportant I think to point out that we do have a nice and profitable relationship with customers on the generic portion of our business. And albeit we may not make much or any on the brand side, the profit stream we get from generic participation as we've talked about before when we were picking up the Rite Aid generic business or the Target generic business. That generic business is a source of profitability, and there is obviously flexibility in how we price those generics. And there's a market for generics. And we have to be responsive to how the market pricing plays for generics. James, maybe you can talk a little bit about the manufacturer side.
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. In terms of when we came into the year, we were assuming that the level of brand manufacturer or pricing inflation would be modestly below what we had seen in the previous fiscal year. And today, we've updated that tight commentary to now being meaningfully below what we saw last year. To try to perhaps put a little bit more quantification around that, I would say that the delta, if you will, between the rate of inflation that we expected and the one that we have seen thus far year-to-date is greater than a third reduction versus our original expectations. The other thing I would comment on in terms of the brand income, why this inflation rate is important is that there is both a fixed component and a variable component of the income that we receive from branded manufacturers. Now, a year or more ago, we were talking about that being a roughly 80%, 20% type split in terms of the fixed component of the equation versus the variable component. In part, the contracts have evolved. But also in part as inflation rates have come down in the last few months, I peg that split more at 90%, 10%. 90% of our income is fixed, 10% is variable. But obviously, that 10 points is still being able to have a meaningful impact on the financials that we've been talking about today.
Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: James, can you help us understand what the actual rate of inflation was last year, when you say you expected it to be down, but now it's meaningfully down? Is there a number you can put around that?
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: I wouldn't throw out a specific number, but that's why I articulate, the decline that we have seen in the inflation rate is greater than a third of the original expectation for the year. So it's a significant decline.
Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: I think, Lisa, also, when we look at what we come up with from a calculation perspective on branded inflation, it's plus or minus what you'll see from published sources of inflation. But it is also important to point out that those averages sometimes don't necessarily tell the whole story, because of the mix, or the relationship, or the individual products that are going up or going down in the portfolios can be materially different. And so I do think the economics aren't always necessarily driven with the direct correlation to the average price increases that everybody talks about.
Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Yeah.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with UBS.
Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC: Good afternoon, guys. I'm going to take this in a little bit of a different direction. I just want to clarify relative to the Change Healthcare deal. James, if you don't mind going back over it, so you said, I believe, $1.10 to $1.30 of dilution from the deal, offset by some other estimate. So is that $1.10 or $1.30 a net dilution deal number to the entire business, or is that offset by those benefits, in which case we're on our own to make the assumptions on that front?
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. So you should think of the $1.10 to $1.30 as the combined effect of the two items that I discussed. The impact of the deferred revenue and then the impact of the higher interest expense on $6.1 billion worth of debt. So wanted to put quantification around those two items. Then, the other comment I made was getting at the reality that as we're actually operating the business and starting to drive the synergies, the EPS that will drive from the contributed assets, if you will, our share of NewCo will be greater than the ability of those assets, absent our deal with Change Healthcare, to drive EPS. So there's an accretive effect, if you will, on that element of the equation. As you would expect, when we come together and drive synergies in a deal. But there are also going to be these two large, very distinct items that will drive dilution, the interest expense and the deferred revenue, haircut you could call it, and that those two items total to this $1.10 to $1.30 range that I mentioned.
Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. I know this is a complicated transaction. I appreciate the color. I'll let other people ask some other questions.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Credit Suisse.
Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): I guess to that, James, do you have any growth forecasts for each of the businesses, EIS and the others? I don't think I see them anywhere. And just maybe, can you speak to the inventory environment? I know last year you scaled up inventory meaningfully in the third quarter. This year you liquidated some. I mean, does that not account for some of the profit shortfall? I know you say you don't do it, but isn't there some opportunity associated with that practice from a profit standpoint that maybe fell out of the model?
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: There was nothing unusual in the third quarter. You would very normally have an inventory build as you come into the winter season. So no, I wouldn't point to anything odd around inventory management. Our cash flow was obviously a bright spot in our numbers here, and that was very much a result of ongoing working capital management initiatives, these sorts of things that have been going on at McKesson for years as well as our underlying operating profitability obviously as well. But the working capital initiatives have been important focus for us, and we'll continue to have that. The first part of your question, the technology businesses, I wouldn't get into specific growth rates around EIS or any particular segment of the business. Overall, we feel as though our technology segment is performing very nicely, they're very much where we expected them to be at this point in the year. Even though there, as John mentioned in his remarks, is plenty of work going on around setting up the new company or preparing to set up the new company, so we've been pleased that they've been able to maintain their focus. And so we feel good about the trajectory of those businesses generally.
Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And just a clarification. James, you did liquidate inventory in the September quarter of this year that did not scale up. Is it just a combined effect of all the businesses resulted in a modest reduction?
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. What I was observing is, in Q3, you would normally have an inventory buildup as you go into the winter season. So yes, that's right.
Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): All right. Thank you.
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for the questions. Yeah, John, I guess like others I'm surprised to hear you highlight competitive pricing, just given how rational the industry has been for so long. And I guess if I take a step back, this year alone, we've seen the negative impact to profitability from generic pricing, moderating. Now, we're talking about a slowdown in branded inflation. Is there any thought that those dynamics themselves are what are forcing your competitors to maybe go harder after market share to make up for what seemingly would have created a shortfall in profit? And then, I guess more importantly, how sustained do you think this competitive behavior could be? Do you think this is more of a one-off, a few accounts that they went after harder, or do you think this could potentially be a more lasting changing dynamic?
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: I think those are all good questions. I think that the best way for me to answer them would be the way we think at McKesson. I can't speak to how our competitors make their decisions or how they make their pricing calls in the industry. I can tell you that McKesson is focused on retaining our customer base and creating additional value for our customers as I talked about before, and charging a fair price. And on that fair price idea, there is plenty of headroom in terms of the value we deliver to the industry that we don't charge for. And as I've seen in the past when – we have faced pressures like this, where there's been a reduction in product launches or other things happen, with some of the profit pools become more difficult. What typically we would attempt to do is reduce the level of incremental discounts that we pass on to our customers when we're in those discussions. But clearly, that conversation isn't successful if there are alternatives that are providing something that is even more significant. My best hope is that we demonstrate to our customers that they're going to always get a fair price from us, and in return, they're going to get superior service and tremendous focus on their success. And that's where we plan to stay. And I know at McKesson, at least, we think growing market share through a price-oriented approach ultimately will not be successful, because customers don't want a change. Our customers, when they get a better deal, come to us and say, hey, listen, can you match this deal because I'd like to stay with you. And so that customer pressure to remain with us because they like us always provides McKesson an advantage when we're in these discussions.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Understood. I'll leave it there. Thank you.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Yeah.
Operator: Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Co.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Just curious, James or John, when we think about the reduction in guidance for the year, can you give us a split, maybe, between how much you think is coming from the customer side, versus how much is from the brand inflation side? Is it half and half or...?
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. So a couple of points. In terms of the negative effects, I would say it's the competitive pricing having a greater impact than the brand manufacturer price inflation rate. But also, remember that we offered $1.60 to $1.90 range for those two items. We're bringing the overall company range down by less than that because we've got tailwinds in our view around our tax rate, around our share count, around our interest expense and so forth. So that's going to drive the delta between the two ranges that we're offering today.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: And then to just follow up on the brand inflation side. Obviously, I think most people coming in would have thought, hey, the elections are a factor driving this. How are you guys thinking about it as we move into next year post-elections? Obviously, a lot of spotlight on Congress right now on this topic. How are you at this point thinking about – do you think it bounces back, or do you think this is maybe the new normal and we have to wait for the anniversary? Any thoughts there would be helpful. Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, I think the view we have is sort of a year-to-date view. We have the same information that you have and probably the same visibility. And we're just guessing as to what manufacturers are likely to do going forward like everybody else. They control their pricing decisions, and we don't have much visibility into anything, other than their historic behavior. And their historic behavior, obviously, has been rising over the last several years. And if you go back before the more recent years, there's always been a level of – at least in our data, always been a level of inflation that has occurred. And you do hear some manufacturers talking today about having a policy around how much inflation they think they should be able to provide to the industry over time. Some of them are making those statements more publicly than others. And clearly, there might be some near-term changes in their behavior that will be different over the longer haul. We do think that innovation requires profitability. We think the lack of new product launches in the face of generic conversions causes pressure to branded manufacturers and that they ought to have the ability to raise price appropriately on branded drugs to help fund their R&D requirements and their profitability requirements. And so I think that a common person's view would be that you'd still see inflation at some levels. I think that the outer bounds of inflation that had been experienced in the past by our industry, that we've had conversations about in the past, are probably likely to not exist anymore. So I just think those heavy outliers on both brand and generic, those outliers will come in, which obviously will have an effect. But, yeah, it's probably a little bit early to speculate. And I think as we get through the rest of this year, we've given you some assumptions about directionally where we think it's going to be the balance of this year. As we get into the next fiscal year, we'll give you a sense for where we think it's going to be.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks. Is it possible to renegotiate these contracts on the fly, or is it you have to wait as the terms come up? And I'll stop there. Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, I think anything is possible. We typically have renegotiated the contracts when they come up as opposed to whenever we're under significant pressure. I think that we always have the opportunity to go back to manufacturers and demonstrate once again the value that we deliver. And in particular, where manufacturer's behavior has changed dramatically from its previous behavior and we had come to depend on those mechanisms as part of our funding source with that manufacturer, I think we have every right to go back to those manufacturers and say, listen, we need to open the dialog again because by your unilateral decision, you have significantly impacted our profitability on your particular product lines and we don't think that's fair and we want to recover that lost margin. So I think that that certainly is something we plan to pursue.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hi. Good evening. So a few questions here. First of all, just to clarify, John, when you talk about inflation being meaningfully lower, I hear you saying that year-to-date you're seeing greater than a third reduction. And I think going back to past comments, I think you saw 12% last year for your fiscal year. We're getting to around fiscal year 7% year-to-date. But when you think about the December quarter and the March quarter, which usually has a lot of inflation, in your assumption are you assuming that the second half you're going to see that same reduction that you've seen year-to-date? Or are you assuming some acceleration in that given that all the commentary we're hearing about the industry trying to self-regulate? I'm just trying to better understand are you clearing the decks here with this $1.60 to $1.90? Or could there be potentially more downside if in the second half of your fiscal year brand inflation decelerates even more?
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: James, why don't you...
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. Ricky, to answer your question very directly, what we've assumed for the back half of fiscal 2017 is a continuation of the inflation rate that we have experienced year-to-date.
Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So basically the same type of price increases that we've seen year-to-date to continue for the next couple of quarters.
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yes.
Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then when we think about the sell side pressure that you're talking about, is that a number that we can take and annualize into next year? And I think my point being is that, obviously, it's a (57:26) and when we think about the margin implication. Is it fair to assume that you just repriced that portion of the contracts that are perennial for this year, or have you also gone proactively to your customers and locked in contracts that are going to come up in the next year or two at a new pricing level?
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Well, I think those are, obviously, both good questions. I think to the point that James is making when he answered it a moment ago, we typically see stronger price inflation as you get into our third and fourth quarters. And so when we say we're guiding on a year-to-date basis, that already tells you that we believe there'll be some moderation in those quarters relative to previous behaviors. On the sell side, it's a little bit more difficult to make projections because we're basically in a position where we are reacting to some extent and not being the people that are making the decision. I think that our view is that we have made a very significant change in our pricing practice to match where the market is today. And we, like I said to answer another question that was asked, we have seen this kind of event happen in the past as well and we didn't see a continuation of the event. And our objective is to continue to maintain our market share. So I think we believe we provided guidance that has reasonable expectations from that perspective and that you can count on the range. That's one of the reasons that the range is somewhat wider, though, is it's somewhat dependent on what happens going forward.
Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So I think that one of the things that we are all trying to get a better sense of is when we think about fiscal year 2018 and I fully understand that you're not guiding to 2018 and there are a lot of moving parts, but is it reasonable for us to take that $1.60 to $1.90 in EPS impact that we're going to see in the second half of the year and just use it as a run rate for fiscal year 2018 just for these two components?
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Well, at this very early stage, Ricky, it's really I don't think it's appropriate for us to try to make any predictions about FY 2018. So I think really we should leave that for closer to the start of that fiscal year. And we'll, obviously, be getting into our guidance process as normal.
Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I'm just assuming all steady state, right? So if you're seeing the step-down in your sell side margin, traffic to the EPS impact is going to just slow through...
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: Yeah. No, I...
Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I guess that's the question right now.
James A. Beer - McKesson Corp.: I understand the logic. It's just hard for me to take a position on FY 2018 at this very early stage.
John H. Hammergren - McKesson Corp.: Yeah, I think it's a difficult question to answer. But I think – I did try to at least bound the conversation around customer pricing, in that this is a pretty significant step-down, and we believe that that allowed us to maintain the relationships with our customers, given what was a pricing environment where we were higher-priced than where we needed to be, and that has occurred, and it's baked into the guidance that we have provided you, in terms of the range that we just refreshed. Now, I think to James' point, it's pretty early to speculate on what branded inflation might be next year, and what else might happen with our customer base. But we tried to give you as much visibility as we possibly can. I know you guys are on a short timeframe. Let me close this call, if I can, and let you know that – I know you share with us the disappointment in today's news. This is not what we had expected, and certainly not what we want. But despite this downward revision to our outlook, we do believe in and remain committed to the value we demonstrate every day to our customers and our manufacturing partners. And as I mentioned a few moments ago, we believe the increased competitive pricing activity does not build sustainable customer relationships or long-term shareholder value, and we are all about sustainable relationships, and creating long-term shareholder value. And we're supported by McKesson's great tradition of customer focus, operational excellence and disciplined execution. And our talented workforce, robust cash flow generation, and strong balance sheet position us for the long-term value creation that we strive to obtain. We remain as committed as ever to our value proposition. And I'll now hand the call off to Craig for his review of upcoming events for the financial community. Craig?
Craig Mercer - McKesson Corp.: Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events for the financial community. On November 8, we will present at the Credit Suisse Healthcare Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona. On January 10, we will present at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, California. We will release third quarter earnings results in late January. Thank you, and good-bye.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

Thank you, and here is John Hammergren.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Craig, and thanks to everyone for joining us on our call. Today we reported a solid start to fiscal 2017. For the first quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $49.9 billion, up 5%, and earnings per diluted share of $3.53, up 18%, both on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. We are maintaining our full year guidance range of $13.43 to $13.93 for fiscal 2017. Before I dive into the operating results for the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to highlight some recent events that continue to demonstrate our commitment to long-term shareholder value creation. First, we continue to proactively develop our portfolio of businesses. In the past quarter alone, we closed seven acquisitions including Biologics, Vantage Oncology and UDG Healthcare. We started the important work to expeditiously integrate and achieve each acquisition's underlying business case. And we divested our Brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business. Second, we jointly announced with Change Healthcare the creation of a new company to deliver a broad portfolio of solutions that will help lower health care costs, improve patient access and outcomes, and make it simpler for payers, providers and consumers to manage the transition to value-based care. This new health care information technology company will offer complementary capabilities that will help enhance opportunities to benefit customers, employees and shareholders. This is a significant undertaking for both McKesson and Change Healthcare during the past few quarters, and I am pleased with our progress in driving this transaction forward. Last, in May we announced a strategic sourcing partnership with Walmart. Walmart is a very sophisticated company, not just on the logistics side, but around their sourcing and procurement operations. The selection of McKesson is a clear endorsement of not only our long-term partnership, but also McKesson's world-class pharmaceutical sourcing and procurement capabilities. Building a long-term relationship made sense for Walmart and we were the right partner. Our advantage relative to others in the industry is our ability to combine our exceptional operational excellence with our global scale and sourcing expertise. First it takes quality people that are trained and experienced to make this happen. Second, it takes great partners on the manufacturer side to make the supply chain work effectively. And last, it takes a continued source of knowledge and analytics around what's possible to make great procurement decisions. All of these things position McKesson as the best partner in the industry. We've had a very busy first quarter and are encouraged by the work of our employees to successfully execute against so many important initiatives. Turning now to our business results for the quarter. Distribution Solutions revenues were $49.2 billion, up 5% on a constant currency basis, and Distribution Solutions adjusted operating profit was $1.1 billion, flat to the prior year on a constant currency basis and in line with our original expectations. Our North America pharmaceutical distribution and services business, which includes US pharmaceutical, McKesson Specialty Health and McKesson Canada, drove revenue growth in the first quarter of 5% on a constant currency basis, despite the lapping effect of our customer consolidations that occurred late in fiscal 2016. Revenue at our US pharmaceutical business met our expectations in the first quarter, driven by strong growth from customers across the retail, institutional and independent channels. Note that effective April 1, we started servicing the combined Albertsons Safeway network of nearly 1,700 pharmacies in the US under our new five-year distribution agreement, and I'm pleased with our team's execution to onboard this important customer, which includes the sourcing and distribution of both branded and generic pharmaceuticals. I'd like to take a moment to highlight our strong and growing community of independent pharmacy customers. Last month, we hosted our annual ideaShare Conference for our independent retail pharmacy customers, including significant participation from our Health Mart partners. With approximately 4,700 stores nationwide, Health Mart has grown by 50% over the past three years. This growth is attributed largely to, first, our focus on helping our independent retail pharmacy customers deliver, and be recognized for, top clinical performance, and second, our delivery of innovative solutions and implementation support that helps members compete and grow their business. Some important tools available to our independent retail pharmacy customers include Health Mart's Pathway to Better Pharmacy Performance and Profit, a step-by-step approach to help members navigate the changes in today's retail pharmacy market and stay ahead of the curve, and myHealthMart, a proprietary online portal that enables pharmacies to proactively manage their business. Additionally, as a market leader in managed care solutions, McKesson's AccessHealth provides the education, expertise and tools pharmacies need to gain access to, and compete in, preferred networks. In summary, I'm proud of the value we deliver to our independent pharmacy customers, and the innovative services and solutions that set us apart from the competition. Turning now to McKesson Specialty Health, we again delivered impressive growth in our specialty business, driven by the performance in our oncology and other multi-specialty categories. I'd like to spend a minute to highlight an example of our progress and commitment toward the transition to value-based care. The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation is developing new payment and delivery models designed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of specialty care. Among those specialty models is the oncology care model, or OCM, which aims to provide higher quality for highly coordinated oncology care at the same or lower cost to Medicare. Under the OCM, physician practices enter into a payment arrangement that includes financial and performance accountability for care related to chemotherapy. The practices participating in OCM have committed to providing enhanced services to Medicare beneficiaries such as care coordination, navigation and national treatment guidelines for care. Earlier this month, we announced that 12 practices affiliated with the US Oncology Network, representing approximately 800 physicians, will participate in the OCM. In total, approximately 3,200 physicians were chosen to participate in the OCM, which means our network-affiliated physicians represented one fourth of all participating physicians, and if we consider customers supported through our Onmark GPO and Vantage Oncology affiliated practices, McKesson Specialty Health supports nearly 50 practices that have been selected, an unparalleled commitment to value-based oncology. The OCM marks a major milestone in the shift to value-based cancer care, and we congratulate all of our affiliated practices selected to participate in this innovative program. We remain committed to new care delivery models that will better position our affiliated practices to more effectively operate from a clinical and financial perspective, and build further upon our strength in this transformation to value-based care. Moving to our Canadian business, we had nice growth in the quarter with results that were in line with our expectations. Our Canadian operations represent a diverse collection of businesses similar to those in the US, with a particular emphasis on specialty and retail. We expect to close the previously announced Rexall transaction later this calendar year which will further enhance McKesson's retail pharmacy capabilities, procurement scale and best-in-class pharmacy care for patients across Canada. Turning now to our results for international pharmaceutical distribution and services. Revenues for the first quarter were $6.4 billion, up 9% year over year on a constant currency basis. Operating performance from Celesio was slightly below our expectations for the quarter due to recent retail pharmacy reimbursement changes in the UK. While scheduled reimbursement cuts were expected, there were further unanticipated cuts made by the UK government effective in April and June this year which impacted the first quarter and will impact the remainder of the year. Despite the unanticipated events surrounding recent reimbursement changes, as well as the UKs decision to exit the EU, we continue to believe that Celesio represents a strong long-term range growth opportunity across retail, wholesale and specialty. And finally, our medical-surgical business performed well in the quarter with revenues of $1.5 billion, an increase of 2% over the prior year, driven by market growth, partially offset by the prior-year sale of the ZEE Medical business in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Excluding the prior-year second quarter sale of ZEE Medical, growth in the segment was 4%. In summary, I am pleased with the performance of our Distribution Solutions segment in the first quarter. We continue to expect Distribution Solutions revenue growth of high single digits compared to the prior year and that full year adjusted operating margin will remain flat relative to the prior year. Turning now to Technology Solutions, revenues were down 1% for the first quarter to $725 million on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by an anticipated revenue decline in our hospital software business and the prior-year sale of our nurse triage business, largely offset by growth in our other technology businesses. Technology Solutions' operating margin was up significantly relative to the prior year. Our first quarter results benefited from growth in our payer solutions and connectivity businesses including favorable timing and lower operating expenses. We continue to make steady progress across Technology Solutions. Our continued efforts to deliver customer success and improve profitability position our technology businesses well for the future of changed healthcare. I remain confident in our Technology Solutions outlook for the full year which includes an expectation for achieving adjusted operating margin in the low 20% range for the segment. Now to wrap up my comments. McKesson's fiscal first quarter results represent solid execution across both segments, and we are maintaining our full year outlook for fiscal 2017 at a range of $13.43 to $13.93. We are extremely well positioned to execute our portfolio approach to capital deployment and deliver value for our shareholders through a mixture of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. With that, I'll turn the call over to James, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, John, and good afternoon everyone. As John mentioned, today we reported results which reflect a solid start to fiscal 2017. Before I get to our results, I want to note that in addition to our earnings press release and customary tables, we have published a supplemental presentation on our website. This presentation provides an operational, or baseline view, of our fiscal 2017 earnings in constant currency. This baseline view excludes the impacts of cost alignment charges from our adjusted earnings as well as a gain on the sale of a business in the first quarter of the prior year. During my remarks, I will refer to this supplemental slide presentation to review our fiscal 2017 first quarter baseline consolidated earnings and fiscal 2017 earnings outlook. I also plan to reference the first quarter baseline consolidated and segment gross profit, operating expense and operating margin values provided within this presentation. Now let's move to our results for the first quarter. Our adjusted EPS was $3.50 per diluted share which excludes four items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, claim and litigation reserve adjustments, and LIFO-related adjustments. Baseline EPS was $3.53 per diluted share on a constant currency basis. As a reminder, our fiscal 2016 adjusted EPS of $3.14 per diluted share included a gain on the sale of the nurse triage business totaling $0.16 per diluted share. Our consolidated results can be found on schedules two and three of the tables accompanying our press release. Consolidated revenues for the first quarter increased 5% in constant currency. I'll now refer you to slides three and four of the supplemental presentation. First quarter baseline gross profit was up 1% in constant currency year over year, driven by global procurement benefits, recent business acquisitions, and an incremental pre-text gain related to anti-trust settlement proceeds, largely offset by the expected weaker profit contribution from generic pricing trends and the impact of previously disclosed customer consolidation activity. First quarter baseline operating expenses decreased 2% in constant currency, reflecting actions taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 related to our cost alignment plan. Adjusted other income was $23 million for the quarter, an increase of 53% in constant currency, consistent with our fiscal 2017 guidance. Interest expense of $79 million decreased 11% in constant currency for the quarter. Now moving to taxes, our adjusted tax rate was 27.1%, which includes the discrete tax benefit of $37 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, driven by an amended accounting standard related to share-based compensation that I mentioned at our Investor Day in late June. I would note that while the impact of this standard may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, in general, the largest effect will likely continue to occur in our first quarter due to the timing of the expiration and vesting of our share-based compensation awards. For fiscal 2017, we continue to expect a total impact of approximately $0.20 due to this amended accounting standard. As a result of this accounting change, we now expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 30% in fiscal 2017. However as a reminder, this rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. McKesson's baseline net income from continuing operations totaled $805 million in constant currency, excluding after-tax cost alignment charges of $5 million. I'll now refer you to slide five of the supplemental presentation. Our first quarter baseline earnings per share of $3.53 increased 18% in constant currency versus the prior year. The year over year currency headwind equated to $0.01 per diluted share. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 3% year over year to 228 million. We continue to expect a full year share count of 228 million. Let's now turn to the segment results, which can be found on schedule three of the tables accompanying our press release. Distribution Solutions segment revenues of $49.2 billion were up 5% in constant currency during the quarter. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 5% in constant currency in the quarter, primarily reflecting growth in our US pharmaceutical, specialty and Canadian businesses, as well as the contribution from our recent acquisitions. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6.4 billion for the quarter, up 9% in constant currency, driven by market growth and acquisitions. Revenues were modestly impacted by approximately $35 million in unfavorable currency rate movements. Moving now to the medical-surgical business, revenues were up 2% for the quarter, driven by growth in our primary care business, partially offset by the prior year's sale of the ZEE Medical business. I'll now refer you to slide six of the supplemental presentation. Distribution Solutions baseline gross profit was flat on a constant currency basis for the quarter. Baseline gross profit reflected the anticipated weaker profit contribution from generic pricing trends, customer consolidation headwinds, and lower compensation from our branded pharmaceutical manufacturer when compared to the prior year. As we've discussed previously, the year over year impact from weaker generic pricing trends will more heavily impact the first half of our fiscal 2017. For the full year, we continue to expect a nominal contribution from generic pharmaceuticals that increase in price. Benefiting our first quarter baseline gross profit was the incremental impact of a pre-tax gain related to an anti-trust settlement recorded in the quarter, which was contemplated in our original fiscal 2017 guidance. As a reminder, in Q1 of fiscal 2016 we recorded a pre-tax gain of $59 million related to anti-trust settlement proceeds, so the year over year impact in the most recent quarter from these settlements totaled $83 million. We continue to expect that branded pharmaceutical pricing trends will be modestly below those experienced in fiscal 2016. Let's move now to slide seven of the supplemental presentation. First quarter Distribution Solutions segment baseline operating expenses were flat on a constant currency basis. The segment operating expenses benefited from the cost alignment plan actions taken in late fiscal 2016 and lower operating expenses due to the sale of ZEE Medical in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. I'll now refer you to slide eight in the supplemental presentation. Distribution Solutions first quarter segment baseline operating profit was flat in constant currency at $1.1 billion. Segment adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 231 basis points, a decrease of 11 basis points on a constant currency basis, driven by the expected weaker generic pricing trends, recent customer consolidation and lower compensation from our branded pharmaceutical manufacturer, offset by the anticipated anti-trust settlement recorded in the quarter, global procurement benefits and lower operating expenses. We continue to expect the segment baseline operating margin to approximate the fiscal 2016 baseline operating margin. Now turning back to schedule three of the tables accompanying our press release. Technology Solutions revenues were down 1% for the quarter to $725 million on a constant currency basis, driven by the anticipated decline in our hospital software business and the prior year sale of the nurse triage business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses. I will now refer you to slides nine and ten of the supplemental presentation. First quarter baseline segment gross profit was up 11% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by the timing of a few items that were originally expected later in fiscal 2017. First quarter baseline operating expenses in the segment decreased 10% in constant currency from the prior year, driven by actions related to the cost alignment plan. Let's now move to slide 11 in the supplemental presentation. Baseline segment operating profit increased 53% in constant currency, resulting in an operating margin of 24.55%, up 879 basis points over the prior year. This improvement was driven by our continued focus on higher margin businesses, lower operating expenses and certain timing benefits. We continue to expect the full year segment baseline operating margin to be in the low 20% range. I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding increased 1 day from the prior year to 27 days. Our days sales in inventory were flat from the prior year at 30 days, and our days sales in payables increased 6 days from the prior year to 59 days. We generated $1.9 billion in cash flow from operations during the first quarter. We continue to expect cash flow from operations to grow by approximately 15%, excluding $217 million (24:37) in expected cash payments related to the combination of the cost alignment plan and a settlement with the US government, which we previously disclosed in April of 2015. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $4.7 billion, with $2.5 billion held offshore. Internal capital spending totaled $114 million for the first quarter. We continue to deploy capital in line with our portfolio approach. In particular, we have been active on the M&A front, announcing the creation of a new company with Change Healthcare as well as closing seven acquisitions during the quarter. And yesterday, the Board of Directors approved the quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share. I'll now turn to our fiscal 2017 outlook and refer you to slide 12 in the supplemental presentation, which outlines our anticipated year over year baseline earnings growth. As John discussed earlier, we are reiterating our fiscal 2017 outlook of $13.43 to $13.93, which excludes approximately $0.12 to $0.15 in expected charges related to the cost alignment plan announced in March of 2016. This range provides baseline earnings growth of 7% to 11% year-over-year. Our outlook anticipates a foreign currency rate headwind of approximately $0.10 during fiscal 2017, consistent with our recently updated guidance announcement on June 29. And as a reminder, on May 4, we guided that our fiscal 2017 results would be weighted to the second half of the fiscal year. We continue to expect to generate approximately 48% of our earnings in the first half of the year. And as a reminder, given the expected timing of the close of the transaction with Change Healthcare, we are not currently assuming that the creation and operation of the new company will impact our FY 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share. Thank you, and with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Justin?
Operator: Thank you. And our first question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks and good afternoon. In the 10-Q tonight I noticed that there was a comment on Distribution Solutions gross margin being impacted by lower compensation from a branded pharmaceutical manufacturer. I'm sure that's a fairly obvious item, I can guess at what manufacturer that might be, but I'd love any commentary you have on that, and just want to make sure it's not more of a sector theme as opposed to a one-off situation.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, thanks, Eric, for the question. I think your perspective is probably correct, and I would like to just further by saying our relationship with the branded manufacturers remains pretty consistent across the board. Our contracts renew on a regular basis with very minor modifications to the terms typically. And what you see here is just basically a difference in the yield year on year from an existing agreement with an existing supplier.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And again, John, you think that's clearly a one-time item with this one manufacturer?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well certainly the magnitude of it is. If you think about the year on year change in pricing behavior, that's really what's the driver behind it.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. Thanks very much.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Operator: And our next question will come from Garen Sarafian with Citi Research.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good afternoon. First I guess I'll take the obligatory generic inflation moderation question. In your prepared remarks, you sort of reiterated your expectation of nominal contributions to earnings. But could you just elaborate a little bit further as to what you've seen since last quarter, just to give us more insight?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Really, it's been a very similar theme in recent months, so it wouldn't likely point to any particularly notable change quarter over quarter.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then on implementing Walmart, congratulations on that deal, but could you discuss the timeline of when this will occur? You mentioned it being operational by the end of fiscal 2017, but I'm wondering what are the critical steps that are preventing some of the benefits from occurring earlier? So for example, wouldn't at least some of your current contracts be tiered for additional volume so that you could benefit from incremental scale sooner?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well our agreements, as you point out, are in place today, and one of the things we will be doing as we go to market with the new Walmart relationship will be modifying those agreements to reflect some of the incremental volume delivered by Walmart. But really a combination of the terms and other features of these contracts exist with both organizations. And I do think there clearly is some nominal value that may be delivered in FY 2017. We really think that the preponderance of the value will be delivered in FY 2018, and I think that's consistent with what we've said before, and that's still what we think, Garen.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Fair enough.
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I'd just add to that, that it does take some months to ramp up the physical side of these relationships, and that was very much the case when we implemented the broader relationship with Rite Aid, for example.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): All right. Got it. Thanks again.
Operator: And moving on to Charles Rhyee with Cowen.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. John, obviously you're closing on the, you have the Rexall business in Canada. You are running retail operations in the UK, and with Health Mart you have obviously kind of a franchise business. Any reason at some point in the future with the way the retail market is consolidating in the US, does that ever create an option for you to branch back into the domestic side, on the US side of the business, into a retail pharmacy?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well I think we've been asked the question before, obviously, and our chosen path in the US is to partner with our customers. And as you mentioned, independents in particular have been great partners and a growing base of our business, particularly the transition of our customer base from just buying wholesale services from us to being partners in the Health Mart business. And that really is a much more intimate relationship and one where the customer benefits significantly from our involvement, and clearly we do as well because they buy more and more of their product and service requirements from us. We have lots of other customers that are very successful in competing in this market, and frankly we just don't see it, an alternative for us to enter the market directly, both that would benefit us, but also at the same time allow us to provide additional benefit to our customers. So I just don't see us entering the retail space directly in the US, but we'll continue to support our customers as we have in the past.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Appreciated. And then as a follow-up, if we look at the regional chains, outside as of the big major retail chains, can you talk about sort of your share in sort of the more regional chains across the US, and sort of what that landscape looks like? And do those tend to be Health Mart customers or when we think about Health Mart, or think about even smaller kind of numbers, owned stores? Thank you.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well yeah, you're welcome. Most of the regional chains have their own very strong brands and particularly if they're part of a combination where they're selling groceries or warehousing kind of marketing tools, there probably is little interest for them to use the Health Mart brand. But obviously, we'd be open to them participating with Health Mart any way that we can. I would say the preponderance of our Health Mart stores are independent stores, and they'd be aggregated into regional chain-like setups, but that they would still be small in terms of total numbers of stores per aggregator, if that's the way to explain it.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Operator: And next will be Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, hi. Good evening. A couple of questions here. First of all, John, can you comment on the discussions, the ongoing discussions with manufacturers on specialty pricing models?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, we're very excited about the growth in our specialty business overall. We've made significant strides in building out our value proposition for the customers. You heard us talk about oncology in particular, but in several of the specialties, I think we're very well positioned and the business continues to grow at rates that would be at or above market level. So we are well positioned and we're pleased with the array of services that we provide. Clearly the manufacturer and the customer are both important aspects of driving profitability in that business, and we are continuing to expand the relationships in both directions, and we do believe that the manufacturers benefit significantly by using our services and are willing to pay for those services, because it certainly reduces a lot of the financial and logistics workloads that they have on their laps. So I hesitate to speak universally about a class of customers, but I think our relationships with the manufacturers are very sound and those relationships continue to build.
Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then a follow-up question on the numbers, just because of the moving parts here. So first of all, James, was the $0.38 in litigation benefit that you talked about on the Analyst Day, did you assume that it will all be captured in the June quarter?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. That was our assumption going into the year. I mentioned back on the January earnings call that it was a single case and that it was quite far along. So that was very much a part of our initial full year guide to you. And then the other thing really just to emphasize is the fact that we also have an anti-trust settlement of substantial scale in Q1 of last fiscal year. So the year-over-year impact from these anti-trust settlements is $83 million versus the much larger figure that we recorded specifically in this Q1.
Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And when we think about the margin, because obviously for us when we model those operating margin assumptions are important. I think that last year you've given us some guidance there. You haven't this year. So when we think about the quarter, right, in schedule 2, it's 2.28% in Distribution Solutions. If we back out the benefit from that settlement, we get to around I think 2.03%. What should we be using as a base for the remainder of the year?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, just to reemphasize that for the full year, we're expecting the Distribution Solutions operating margin to be in line with that of the prior year. And so yeah, we're obviously off to a stronger start in Q1 because of this anti-trust settlement very much benefiting us in the back quarter, but really the overall story for the year is flat. The other thing I'd just further emphasize again as you think about the first half/second half split is that we'd expect about 48% of the earnings for McKesson to come in the first half versus the second half.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Ricky, we can go back and check our guidance at the beginning of the year, but I believe we did give you a margin guidance. It was in line with what we just said, flat for full year, so.
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: That's right, we haven't changed that guide since we initially laid out guidance.
Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And to make sure that we're all using the same base for 2016, should we use the 2.29% for the year?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It's 2.34 percentage points.
Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So excluding the restructure. Okay.
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Right. Yeah, I think that's the way you should think about it.
Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah.
Operator: And next will be Steven Valiquette with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America: Thanks. Good afternoon, John and James. Yeah, so I guess for us there's been obviously some discussion in the pharma supply channel this year about lower penetration rates at some of the more recent individual first-time generic launches relative to the brand. Could you just remind us again your observations on that subject and really just specifically, it seems to us that maybe some of those key generics that were in question have now actually achieved some much higher penetration rates with the passage of some additional time this year. Just curious to get your latest thoughts on that subject. Thank you.
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, in terms of brand to generic conversions, we went into the year believing that we'd see a lower overall profit contribution than had been the case in the prior fiscal year. And obviously, Crestor has been a big launch early in the year, and based on what we've seen there, we don't have any change in our point of view. We would continue to believe that we'll see a lower profit contribution from these brand to generic conversions.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, there really isn't much of a change in our past experience based on what we're seeing today. And I think there's the best way to sum it up, Steven.
Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America: Okay. Well and a quick one just on the cost alignment plan progress. I guess that you've dug deeper into your operations. Have you found any new or additional sources of savings, or is everything about as expected with that whole program?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No, that's moving along as I expected it to, again, at the point where we last talked about our guidance. So no, it's very much on track as expected.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think the charges you're seeing or will see this year are charges we anticipated when we launched the program last year. They just had to be recognized when they were realized, and some of them were going to be realized this year. So it's not a new cost alignment plan, it's a continuation of the one that has already been completed and the financial impact of some of those charges rolled into this year.
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, that's right. Some of the charges have to be taken in fiscal 2017 versus the bulk that we took in fiscal 2016.
Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America: Okay. Great. Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And moving on to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much. John, I just wanted to follow up on an earlier comment that you made around the branded manufacturer. I'm just curious, as we think about inventory management agreements on your branded business, I think in the past you've talked about 85% to 90% are under inventory management agreements. Are you seeing any changes in that other 10% to 15% as some of those manufacturers come under pressure to have a more firm relationship with the distributor, or a more defined relationship like some of the larger manufacturers do?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think we have not seen much of a change in the big relationships. They remain pretty consistent, and I'd just sort of remind people that even in some of the larger relationships, there is exposure that remains both positive and negative depending on how you look at it relative to their price increase activities. And so when we talk about the year over year change, you can imagine that with that particular manufacturer, we benefited from their previous price increase patterns and in this quarter have benefited to a lesser degree, and that's why we call it out. But if you step back from that specific individual company, we're not really seeing any change to the character of our relationships.
Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, just looking at the technology side of your business coming in better than at least our expectations in the quarter. I'm just wondering if it beat your expectations and if there's anything notable to call out within that business in the quarter?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, we ran through some of the drivers. Obviously, we're very pleased with the progress of the results there, very much a focus on the higher margin businesses, very much lower expenses as a result of the cost alignment plan and so forth. But at the same, there are also some timing items that benefited Q1 that I would expect to revert out in Q2. So I'd just temper the situation with that last thought.
Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: And you heard us in our prepared remarks talk about the low 20% type of margin, which is slightly below obviously what we recorded in the first quarter, which is reflective of us going back to a more normal run rate. But I would agree with you that we see the business performing very well, and it sets us up nice as we think about the completion of our transaction with Change Healthcare. And we think customers in particular and investors will benefit significantly from the combination.
Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: That's helpful. Thank you.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Operator: And moving on to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. So lot of confusion I can sense from my inbox on sort of the implied 2Q guide, and I realize you guys don't typically give a ton of sequential commentary, but I think some of the issue is just sort of off of what base to think about the 48% in the first half. So I just, one, want to make sure we're all talking about the same numbers in terms of which of the two sort of annual forecasts, with or without the CAP we're speaking to, and that we've got clarity. And then, if you could just help us, other than the sequential sort of shift obviously in the anti-trust plus tax, how to think about the progression aside from those two factors.
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, so the base from which I'm making that 48% first half comment is very much from our guide of $13.43 to $13.93, which is excluding $0.12 to $0.15 of CAP charges. So that's the base from which you should start. In terms of Q1 versus Q2 items, I just mentioned to Lisa the point that I would expect there will be some timing items around the Technology Solutions business. And then obviously, Q1 benefited substantially from the anti-trust settlement, that roughly $0.38 in the quarter, equivalent to a year over year impact of $83 million. And then in terms of the change in accounting around share-based compensation, as we discussed at Analyst Day, that was going to be $0.16 benefit for Q1. And then only another incremental $0.04 over the balance of the year, so just directionally about a $0.01 or so benefit in Q2. So I think those are the important drivers, if you will, of the Q1/Q2 split.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: Okay, that was helpful. And maybe just quickly for John, was there anything in either of the two lead candidates for president, the platforms, that you thought was sort of notably relevant for the business? I mean obviously more recently, a lot of was made on Part B and a few other things. But I'm curious if anything stuck out to you that was notable?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think the thing that's most notable is that in both platforms, you hear a discussion about cost and quality at some level. And clearly we believe the healthcare industry is headed on a continued improvement front on both of those dimensions. We need to take cost out of the healthcare system, and we need better visibility to quality, and people are increasingly going to be paid in a way that reflects the value they deliver on those two dimensions. So I think regardless of the candidate that wins, or the party platform that gets adopted, we're trying to help our customers prepare for that environment of more cost pressure, and more inspection of their ability to deliver value. And part of that is also going to require them to collaborate and connect across the boundaries of their individual businesses. So I would say that that theme is the thing that stuck out the most, is that I think the issues that have been raised in the previous administration around these issues, or I should say the interest raised around these issues in the previous administration will continue.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: Thank you.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: And next question will come from David Larsen with Leerink.
David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC: Hi. Can you talk about your ability to move share with biosimilars please and how that may differ from some of your competitors? Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well we're pleased with our position in specialties. I mentioned it a few moments ago, and I think that our business has continued to focus heavily on our ability to add value to our customers and deliver through our scale and knowledge a product at an improved value. Clearly, biosimilars produce an opportunity for us to reduce cost and deliver quality to our customers, and in places where we can influence the selection of the biosimilar, we believe we will benefit and our customers will benefit. Clearly part of the challenge biosimilars face in the market is their ability to prove the equivalence of their product compared to the originator. And we think in particular, our US Oncology Network is prepared to work with manufacturers to do the type of work that will be necessary, not only to prove to us that the product produces a similar result at a lower cost, but also provide a beachhead or a benchmark from which other customers can be convinced given the rigor and discipline that our network uses to evaluate these types of opportunities. So I think in some categories we may not have much influence, but clearly in products that are used in clinics or in oncology practices in particular, we're very well positioned to create value for the manufacturers and as a result deliver value to our customers through that relationship with the manufacturers.
David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC: Great, and then regarding Omnicare, Optum and Target, we're completely through all of those as of this quarter. Is that correct?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No. I wouldn't put it that way. I think it's important to note that the year over year headwinds from both generic pricing effects and customer consolidation, the cash grow you're just referring to are very much weighted to our first half of the fiscal year. So once we get into the second half, they're significantly less, but they're very relevant in the first half of fiscal 2017 year over year.
David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks for the questions. John, you mentioned the change in reimbursement in the UK. Any chance you could give us a sense or quantify the headwind that that creates in fiscal 2017 versus your previous expectations? And then within international, I know the original guidance was for low double digit constant currency revenue growth. Does that still hold true in light of these reimbursement changes?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well I'll let (50:19) first question a little bit. The second question you may have to repeat so I make sure I fully understand what it was. On the first one, I think that the second change the UK – the first change we understood and we saw it coming, and we had prepared our organization to make moves to offset it and to grow through it. And I think the second change was almost equal in its magnitude related to the first change, which was not insignificant, and so the second change is going to be more problematic for us. And that's I think what we're preparing to deal with as we go through this fiscal year. If you step back from those two issues, the Celesio businesses are performing quite well, and in fact, we're making progress in almost every country to improve our market position, our operational efficiency, getting our product service levels up and so on, the technology that's necessary to support the business including moving into areas hopefully like specialty and the hospital business, et cetera, over time. So I think we're quite pleased with the progress of the businesses. I think that the second hit in the UK was not anticipated, and frankly will be a little bit of a headwind for that business this year.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: No, and I guess just, John, to the follow-up on that specifically was just previously you guys had talked about low double digit constant currency revenue growth in the international business. I was asking in light of this second reimbursement hit, does that expectation still hold true for the international business's revenue growth?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. The significant driver of that double digit revenue guide is really the effect of the acquisitions that we closed a number of them in Q1. We have others yet to close, including the Sainsbury's transaction for example. So really that will be the driver of our ability to execute against that double digit guide.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So it's probably fair to say that the cuts in the UK are not a significant impact on the revenue side of Celesio. So we'd expect those earlier forecasts to hold. It's more of an issue to earnings in that business than it is revenue.
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. That's right.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Understood. Thank you.
Operator: And moving on to George Hill with Deutsche Bank.
George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good afternoon guys, and thanks for taking the questions. James, I think if we think about the gross margin pressure, the gross margin erosion, if you were to just kind of bucket it by order of magnitude if we think about the tough comps on generics, how much of it is mix, brand versus generic versus specialty? And how much of it is just kind of the changing of the business mix given the M&A that's going on, I guess? How should we think about kind of the leading drivers of generic pressure, I'm sorry, of margin pressure?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, if you think about the gross profit margin, I would really point you back to the impact on a year over year basis, the impact of generic price increase activity and the customer consolidation issue, particularly on the Care and the Target pharmacies. That's really the most significant pairing that's driving the gross profit margin line. And then the other thing that we've spoken about this afternoon is that branded manufacturer, and the compensation that we happen to have driven from them in this particular quarter.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Compared to prior year.
George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, I guess then maybe if I step back and I back all this out, if I back out the items in Q1 of last year, and the items of Q1 of this year, would gross margin actually have been up, ex the generic drug pricing impact? Like would margins have actually expanded?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No. I would say the effect of those customer consolidations had a significant impact on the gross profit line in Q1, and again that factor and the generic pricing increase factor will be significant in the first half of our fiscal year, so in Q 2 as well.
George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, and maybe just last quick follow-up. John, I know it's early in the process, but any interest in EIS yet, and has that process kind of started to get rolling yet? Thank you.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: It's probably too early to talk about EIS. Clearly, we're focused on making sure we maintain that customer base and continue to develop the product and retain the people, and as we have news to update you guys on, we'll certainly bring it to you.
George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Operator: And we have a question from Greg Bolan with Avondale Partners.
Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC: Thanks guys. So just going back to Ross's question, because we're definitely getting pinged as well here. So, I just want to make sure we're kind of all on the same page as we think about – so if we kind of use $3.17 in 2Q of last year, just backing out the benefits from ZEE Medical, and what the implied is for the second quarter, it looks like potentially down year on-year just in terms of earnings growth in 2Q. Is that just kind of the remainder of the residual impact from this negative comp, if you will, and generic pricing and then we kind of start to lap that to some degree as we get into the third and the fourth quarter? Is that kind of another way to think about it as well?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, actually yeah. I'd just emphasize again, the impact in both Q1 and we expect in Q2 of the twin effects of the generic pricing environment, the lack of price increases relative to the prior year, and the effect for us of the move of Omnicare and Target away from us. So those are both going to be significant drivers in both Q1 and Q2.
Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC: Okay. Perfect. Thanks, James.
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Okay.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well thank you, Justin, for helping us out today, and thanks to all of you on the call for your time today. McKesson is off to a good start for fiscal 2017 and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us. I want to recognize the outstanding performance of our employees and their contributions to driving better business health for our customers every day. I'll now turn the call back to Craig for his review of upcoming events for the financial community. Craig?
Craig Mercer - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, John. Our preview of upcoming events for the financial community. On September 13, we will present at the Morgan Stanley Global Health Care Conference in New York. On November 8, we will present at the Credit Suisse Health Care Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona. We will release second quarter earning results in late October. Thank you and goodbye.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for your participation today, and have a great day.

Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the McKesson Corporation quarterly earnings call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Erin Lampert - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, Vicki. Good afternoon and welcome to the McKesson fiscal 2016 fourth quarter earnings call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO, and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update, and then James will review the financial results for the quarter and the full year. After James's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 6 PM Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, I would call your attention to supplemental slides which we will reference on today's call and can be found on the Investors page of our website. We believe the supplemental slides, which include non-GAAP measures, will provide useful information for investors with regard to the company's core operating performance and comparability of financial results period over period. Please refer to our press release announcing fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results and the supplemental slides for further information and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thanks and here's John Hammergren.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. I am pleased with our fourth quarter results, which were driven by solid execution across both our Distribution Solutions and our Technology Solutions segments. Fiscal 2016 was a year of growth and expansion across McKesson despite the headwinds resulting from generic pharmaceutical pricing trends and industry consolidation. I want to highlight a few important accomplishments across our company over the last year. In our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, we continue to expand our relationships with our customers and drive strong growth across all channels, including national retailers, independent pharmacies, and health systems. Our global sourcing and procurement office, based in London, delivered tremendous results in fiscal 2016. And I am proud of our team's performance and the value they are delivering on a global basis for our company and for our manufacturing partners. In fiscal 2017, we expect to achieve the full run rate of procurement-related synergies as articulated in the original Celesio acquisition, more than one year ahead of the original business case. Our Specialty Health business delivered strong mid-teens revenue growth for the fiscal year while announcing two strategic acquisitions to further complement our core business. We saw solid expansion of our leading independent pharmacy banner programs across the United States, Canada, and Europe. We also saw strong growth across the Lloyds brand pharmacies in Europe. And we were also very pleased to announce our proposed acquisition of Rexall Health in Canada. The operating margin rate in our Technology Solutions segment expanded nicely as a result of our efforts over the last several years at reshaping our portfolio and focusing on our investments. And as we discussed in January, the company undertook a review of its cost structure across the enterprise and implemented a set of actions designed to ensure McKesson remains at the forefront of operational excellence, efficiency, value, and innovation. I also want to highlight McKesson's strong operating cash flow results for fiscal 2016, which exceeded our expectations. For the fiscal year, we generated $3.7 billion in operating cash flow, up 18% year over year. There's one more item I'd like to call to your attention. Many of you joined us in January when we made an unscheduled announcement to highlight some industry trends and company-specific events that impacted our fiscal 2016 results and our preliminary outlook for fiscal 2017. One of the topics we discussed in January and it continues to receive attention, is the subject of generic pharmaceutical pricing. We believe some of you may be seeking clarification as to how it affects various industry constituents. So let me take a moment and talk about how it works here at McKesson. Over a very long period, our generic pharmaceutical portfolio has experienced deflation and continues to do so today. I also would remind you that our agreements with our manufacturing partners contemplate and protect us from a decrease in the value of our inventory. However, on a small group of generic drugs, as we have in the past, we expect – we will continue to experience price increases. When we talk about generic inflation at McKesson, we are specifically referring only to this small subset of generics that experience a price increase. As we think about fiscal 2017, we expect a nominal contribution from those generic pharmaceuticals that will increase in price. We saw this trend early, and our guidance today is consistent with the information we shared with you in January. And further, the fiscal 2017 guidance of $13.30 to $13.80 that we provide you today is in line with what we communicated with you back in January. I'm proud of this management team and their constant focus on growth and innovation to create value for the long term. I'm pleased with our accomplishments in fiscal 2016, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their leadership, consistent focus on putting our customers' success at the forefront of everything that we do. Turning for a moment to the broader industry environment, across all of the markets we serve, the themes of cost, quality, and access remain central to the opportunities and challenges facing healthcare. And as I've seen with relative consistency over my own career, these same themes continue to take a prominent place in the national platform of the current Presidential election process in the United States. I think it is important to remember that the issues of cost, quality, and access are not new. And demographics will continue to drive strong demand for pharmaceuticals, and the use of pharmaceuticals will continue to play an important role in the healthcare systems across the world and remain the most effective and cost-efficient way to treat patients across a variety of disease states and chronic conditions. And the pace of innovation continues to advance our industry in exciting ways, from the discovery of new pharmaceutical therapies to fight and cure disease, to new technology-enabled ways in which consumers are engaging in managing their own health, to real progress we see in the pay-for-value care delivery models that are emerging. Against this backdrop of change, I see great opportunity for McKesson. Change inevitably opens the door to new conversations with customers about how we can bring the strength of McKesson to help address the opportunities they see and the challenges that they face. Our customer-first culture demonstrates a commitment and an awareness that McKesson's long-term success is linked to our customers' success. And while change can bring its own set of challenges, I'm very excited about what the future holds for our company. Now moving on to our business results, Distribution Solutions concluded another solid year with good performance across the segment. North America Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services delivered 11% revenue growth on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. The U.S. Pharmaceutical business delivered solid results for the year despite pricing trends on generic pharmaceuticals that were below our original plan and a few notable customer transitions related to consolidation within our healthcare supply chain. Despite the impact of these two events, the business saw growth and expansion across a number of important areas. In fiscal 2016, we continued to see excellent growth with existing customers who expanded their business with McKesson as well as new customers choosing McKesson as their pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution partner. At the beginning of April, we began to service the pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution for Albertsons and Safeway, and I'm very pleased with the way our team was prepared to hit the ground running on day one. Our OneStop proprietary generics program continued its strong performance and grew 21% year over year. And Health Mart extended its tremendous track record of growth during fiscal 2016, ending the year with more than 4,600 stores or approximately 19% growth over the prior year. I know that customer consolidation which impacted us in fiscal 2016 has caused some to question the scale and competitiveness of McKesson's generic pharmaceutical sourcing. To me, there's no better proof point than some of the examples I just walked you through, where we continue to expand our customer relationships, win new customers, deliver strong growth in our OneStop proprietary generics program, and rapidly expand the number of independent pharmacies who see real value to their bottom line by joining Health Mart. I'm incredibly confident in the strength of our relationships with our manufacturing partners and in McKesson's ability to be a great partner to them through our global procurement scale and operational footprint. In summary, I believe in the core strength and competitive position of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. And while we recently faced challenges related to a shift in generic pharmaceutical pricing trends and customer consolidation, I am confident that this business remains extremely well positioned for continued success. Our Canadian distribution business delivered solid results in fiscal 2016. In addition to the strong performance of our leading Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services business, we also had strong performance across our extensive retail banner business. Several weeks ago, we announced our proposed acquisition of Rexall Health, which we expect to close later this calendar year. This acquisition supports McKesson's commitment to drive value in the industry by improving healthcare solutions delivered in the retail pharmacy setting. And it enhances our ability to provide best-in-class pharmacy care for patients through an expanded retail footprint across Canada. Our team in Canada has an outstanding track record of delivering great value to our customers and to patients, and I'm very excited about the opportunities we see for this business in fiscal 2017 and beyond. Turning now to our Specialty Health business, fiscal 2016 was another year of exceptional growth in our oncology and multi-specialty businesses. We recently brought together several assets under a new Manufacturer Services organization within McKesson Specialty Health. By integrating these capabilities, we will offer improved coordination of our best-in-class solutions to manufacturers and ultimately improve patient access and adherence to essential life-saving therapies. Additionally, we closed on our Biologics and Vantage Oncology acquisitions on April 1. Biologics is the largest independent, oncology-focused specialty pharmacy in the United States. And Vantage Oncology is a leading national provider of radiation oncology, medical oncology, and integrated cancer care. And in combination with our U.S. Oncology Network, this now includes over 120 integrated cancer centers across 29 states. These two important acquisitions will increase McKesson's Specialty Pharmaceutical Distribution's scale, expand our oncology-focused pharmacy offerings, enhance our solutions for manufacturers and payers, and broaden the scope of practice management services available to providers and patients. These investments demonstrate McKesson's commitment to the success of our community oncology partners and our customers. And we believe the acquisitions of Biologics and Vantage Oncology complement our holistic approach to exceptional care for cancer patients. Our teams are hard at work with our new colleagues from both Biologics and Vantage Oncology as they put in place detailed integration plans. And we are incredibly excited about welcoming the talent and expertise that exists across these two terrific organizations to the McKesson team. Turning now to international Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services, I am pleased with the results for fiscal 2016. We are making strong progress on some important investments to strengthen the information technology environment across Celesio while we continue to invest in the European retail pharmacy business. Additionally, in fiscal 2016 we announced a number of acquisitions across several of our markets where we see strong opportunities to enhance our services and capabilities. Looking ahead, Celesio is well positioned to execute on its operating plan, which includes a focus on the integration of acquisitions during fiscal 2017. In our Medical-Surgical business, we saw strong results in our physician office business, including outstanding growth with large accounts and customer wins with integrated delivery networks. Our surgery center and laboratory-focused businesses also delivered strong growth in fiscal 2016. And I'm pleased to report that we have successfully concluded our integration plan of PSS World Medical, which delivered synergies as expected. Overall, I'm proud of our full-year operating performance in Distribution Solutions. We have an exciting year ahead of us in fiscal 2017 that will require us to do what we do best: focus on our customers' success; leverage our culture of operational excellence and innovation to deliver the best value in the industry; and execute, integrate, and deliver value through the acquisitions we have announced. As we look ahead to fiscal 2017, we expect that Distribution Solutions revenues will increase by high single digits compared to the prior year, driven by market growth and acquisitions. Turning now to Technology Solutions, I am pleased by the strong results we delivered in fiscal 2016. We experienced outstanding growth in our payer solutions, medical imaging, and relay connectivity businesses. And while revenue growth in Technology Solutions has been impacted over the last several years, primarily by important actions we have taken to focus our investments and shape our portfolio, our enhanced focus has resulted in meaningful improvements in our adjusted operating margin rate for the segment, which we expect will lead to further margin expansion in fiscal 2017. To wrap up my comments, I believe we have a solid plan for fiscal 2017. Growth across our businesses and growth from capital deployment is balanced against the negative impact of generic pharmaceutical pricing trends in the United States and customer consolidation. We are in a business that continues to generate strong cash flow from operations. And while the business of healthcare continues to transform across the markets we serve around the world, we are well positioned to capitalize on the tremendous opportunities for our company. At McKesson, we have the best management team in the business, and I'm confident in this team's ability to continue to deliver value to our customers and strong financial returns to our shareholders. I'm proud of our performance in fiscal 2016 and look forward to the many exciting opportunities ahead of us in fiscal 2017. With that, I'll turn the call over to James for a detailed review of our financial results. James?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As John discussed earlier, our fiscal 2016 results reflect solid execution and core operational growth from both segments. In addition, we delivered operating cash flow which exceeded our expectations while applying our portfolio approach to capital deployment to create shareholder value. Today, I will cover both the fourth quarter and full-year results. I will also present annual guidance for fiscal 2017. Now before I review our fiscal 2016 results, I would like to address the cost alignment plan, which John mentioned in his remarks. This plan primarily includes workforce reductions and business process initiatives. As outlined in January, our fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings guidance did not include restructuring charges related to this cost alignment plan, given that this plan was initiated late in the fourth quarter. Our earnings press release outlines the pre-tax charges related to the cost alignment plan, totaling $229 million, were recorded during the quarter, representing an adjusted earnings impact of $0.73 for fiscal 2016. Overall, cost alignment charges reduced adjusted gross profit by $26 million and increased adjusted operating expenses by $203 million for the fourth quarter and full year. The tables accompanying our press release outline our reported results inclusive of these cost alignment charges. However, in order to review our core operating performance for the quarter and the fiscal year, my remarks will provide our constant currency results excluding the impact of both the cost alignment charges and the gains realized earlier in FY 2016 on the sale of the Nurse Triage and ZEE Medical businesses. These gains totaled $0.29 per diluted share. Therefore, in addition to our earnings press release and customary tables, we have published a supplemental presentation on our website. This presentation includes additional information about our cost alignment plan, including actual fiscal 2016 charges and the charges anticipated during fiscal 2017. This presentation also provides more of a core operational or baseline view of our fiscal 2016 earnings in constant currency excluding the cost alignment charges and business sale gains that I just mentioned. During my remarks, I will refer to this supplemental slide presentation to review our fiscal 2016 baseline consolidated earnings and fiscal 2017 earnings outlook. I also plan to reference the fiscal 2016 baseline consolidated and statement gross profit, operating expense, and operating margin values provided within this presentation. For the balance of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 results, including consolidated revenues, I will review the customary tables which accompany our earnings press release. Now let's move to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedules 3A and 3B of the tables accompanying our press release. Consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter increased 5% in constant currency. For the full year, revenues were $195.3 billion in constant currency, an increase of 9% over the prior year, led by growth in our Distribution Solutions segment. I'll now refer you to slides three and four of the supplemental presentation. Fourth quarter baseline gross profit was relatively flat and full-year baseline gross profit increased 3% in constant currency year over year. Fiscal 2016 baseline gross profit was driven by the performance of Distribution Solutions, primarily reflecting market growth, our mix of business, and our global procurement benefits, offset by the weaker year-over-year profit contribution from generic pricing trends, primarily in the second half of the fiscal year, which were in line with our previous expectations. Fourth quarter baseline operating expenses declined 4%, and full-year baseline operating expenses were flat in constant currency. For the full year, total baseline operating expenses benefited from lower expenses recorded related to the Nurse Triage and ZEE Medical businesses sold earlier in the fiscal year. Now turning back to Schedules 3A and 3B of the tables accompanying our press release, adjusted other income was $17 million for the quarter and $68 million for the full year. In fiscal 2017, other income is expected to increase by approximately 40% from the fiscal 2016 level, primarily related to the anticipated profit contribution from Celesio's equity investment in Brocacef, which previously announced its acquisition of the Netherlands subsidiary of Mediq. Interest expense of $86 million decreased 4% in constant currency for the quarter. Full-year interest expense of $359 million decreased 4% in constant currency, primarily driven by the retirement of debt obligations during the fiscal year. For fiscal 2017, we expect our year-over-year interest expense to be relatively flat to fiscal 2016, driven primarily by scheduled debt maturities and the incremental financing related to acquisitions we expect to close in fiscal 2017. Now moving to taxes, for the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 28.9% excluding cost alignment charges, reflecting our mix of income and a number of favorable discrete tax items. For fiscal 2017, we expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 31%, which is primarily based on our expected mix of U.S. versus international income. However, this rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. For fiscal 2016, McKesson's constant currency net income from continuing operations totaled $3 billion excluding after-tax cost alignment charges of $169 million and after-tax gains on the sale of the two businesses that I mentioned earlier, totaling $67 million. I'll now refer you to slide five of the supplemental presentation. Our full-year baseline fiscal 2016 earnings per share of $12.52 increased 14% in constant currency versus the prior year. Overall, this year's baseline earnings per share reflects market growth across the Distribution Solutions segment, margin expansion in the Technology Solutions segment, global procurement synergies, the cumulative benefit of share repurchases in the fiscal year, and a lower adjusted tax rate versus the prior year. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 1% year over year to 233 million. During the fourth quarter, we completed a $650 million accelerated share repurchase program, bringing the value of total shares repurchased during fiscal 2016 to $1.5 billion. At the end of fiscal 2016, approximately $1 billion remained on the current share repurchase authorization granted by the board. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding assumption for fiscal 2017 is 228 million. Let's now turn to the segment results, which can be found on Schedules 3A and 3B of the tables accompanying our press release. Distribution Solutions segment revenues were up 5% in constant currency during the quarter to $46.4 billion. For the full year, Distribution Solutions constant currency segment revenues were $192.4 billion, up 9%, primarily driven by market growth in our North America Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services business. In fiscal 2017, Distribution Solutions revenue growth is expected to increase by a high single-digit percentage compared to fiscal 2016. As previously outlined, we continue to assume we retain the existing sourcing and distribution relationship with Rite Aid, which would contribute approximately $13 billion in revenue in fiscal 2017. For the quarter, North America Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services revenues increased 6% in constant currency. For the full year, North American distribution revenues increased 11% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by market growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical, Specialty, and Canadian businesses, offset primarily by the expiration of our contract with Optum at the start of our third quarter. For fiscal 2017, we expect our North American Distribution business to deliver a high single-digit percentage revenue growth compared to fiscal 2016. International Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services revenues were nearly $6 billion for the quarter, up 2% in constant currency. For the full year, international revenues of $23.5 billion were impacted by approximately $3 billion in unfavorable currency rate movements, primarily attributable to a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar when compared to the prior year. For the full year, revenues were $26.5 billion in constant currency, up 1%, driven by growth in our UK business, partially offset by the loss of a hospital contract in Norway during fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2017, we expect Celesio's revenues to grow by a low double-digit percentage on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by the acquisitions we announced in fiscal 2016. Moving now to the Medical-Surgical business, revenues were up 1% for the quarter and 2% for the full year, driven by strong growth in our primary care business, offset by the sale of ZEE Medical in the second quarter and weaker market conditions affecting our long-term care business. Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, we expect to drive mid-single-digit percentage revenue growth year over year. I'll now refer you to slide six of the supplemental presentation. Distribution Solutions baseline gross profit decreased 1% in constant currency for the quarter and increased 3% in constant currency for the full year. Full-year segment baseline gross profit reflected market growth and our mix of business, including a growing proportion of specialty pharmaceuticals, weaker profit contribution from generic pricing trends when compared to the prior year, and lower profit contribution from our Medical-Surgical business, primarily driven by the sale of our ZEE Medical business in the second quarter. Full-year Distribution Solutions baseline gross profit also included our global procurement synergies and $76 million in antitrust settlement proceeds. Let's now move to slide seven of the supplemental presentation. Full-year segment baseline operating expenses increased 1% in constant currency from the prior year. Segment baseline operating expenses benefited from lower operating expenses following the sale of the ZEE Medical business. Now I'll refer you to slide eight in the supplemental presentation. Distribution Solutions full-year baseline operating profit increased 7% in constant currency to $4.5 billion. And we ended the year with a baseline operating profit margin of 234 basis points, four basis points below the adjusted operating margin we reported in the prior year. Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, we expect the segment baseline operating margin to approximate the fiscal 2016 baseline operating margin. Underpinning this outlook in fiscal 2017 is planned growth in segment baseline operating profit, driven by the contribution from our generics business, including both our global sourcing efforts and expanded one-stop sales, strong growth from our specialty, Canadian, international, and Medical-Surgical businesses, and the contribution from the previously announced acquisitions we expect to close in the fiscal year. Offsetting this anticipated profit expansion, we expect lower profit contribution from the customer contracts we previously discussed during fiscal 2016 but were impacted by market consolidation. In the U.S. market, we also expect branded drug pricing trends to be modestly below those experienced in fiscal 2016. And we anticipate a nominal contribution from generic pharmaceuticals that increase in price during fiscal 2017. We also expect the contribution from the launch of new oral generic drugs in the U.S. market to decline from the prior year. And finally, we expect a higher mix of more complex and expensive therapies, which will impact our margin rate. Now, turning back to Schedules 3A and 3B of the tables accompanying our press release, Technology Solutions revenues were down 5% for the quarter and down 6% for the full year to $2.9 billion. This full-year decline was driven by the anticipated revenue softness in our hospital software business, the sale of the Nurse Triage business, and the wind-down and transition of our UK Workforce business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses. Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, we expect Technology Solutions revenues to decline slightly year over year, as growth in our connectivity, payer solutions, medical imaging, and provider revenue cycle businesses will be more than offset by an anticipated revenue decline in our hospital software business. Now I'll refer you to slides nine and slide 10 of the supplemental presentation. Full-year baseline segment gross profit was flat year over year in constant currency. Full-year baseline operating expenses in the segment declined 5% in constant currency from the prior year. Full-year baseline operating expenses benefited from various ongoing cost management initiatives, including the fiscal 2015 Workforce reductions and lower expenses following the sale of the Nurse Triage business in the first quarter. Let's now move to slide 11 in the supplemental presentation. Baseline segment operating profit increased 12% in constant currency, driving a full-year baseline operating margin of 18.72%, up 288 basis points over the prior year. During fiscal 2017, we expect the baseline operating margin for the segment to be in the low-20% range. I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. For receivables, our days sales outstanding increased two days from the prior year to 28 days. Our days sales in inventories increased one day from the prior year to 32 days. And our days sales in payables increased five days from the prior year to 59 days. As a result of our profit growth and disciplined approach to working capital management, we reported $3.7 billion in cash flow from operations during fiscal 2016. And we ended the year with a cash balance of $4 billion, with $2.2 billion held offshore. In fiscal 2017, we expect cash flow from operations to grow by approximately 15% excluding $270 million in expected cash payments related to the combination of the cost alignment plan and a settlement agreement with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Department of Justice, as previously disclosed in April of 2015. Internal capital spending totaled $677 million for fiscal 2016. For fiscal 2017, internal capital spending is projected to be between $700 million and $800 million. Our dividend obligation to Celesio's non-controlling shareholders is included within a line titled Net Income Attributable to non-Controlling Interests on Schedule 1 of the tables accompanying our press release. We expect this obligation to drive a fiscal 2017 expense of $46 million, or approximately $12 million per quarter assuming a 76% ownership stake. During fiscal 2017, we also expect to record income for non-controlling interests related to our joint venture physician partners operating within Vantage Oncology, the previously announced and now completed acquisition within our U.S. Specialty business. As a result, in fiscal 2017, we expect income attributable to non-controlling interests to increase by approximately 50% from fiscal 2016. And finally, we also anticipate a foreign currency rate headwind of approximately $0.03 during fiscal 2017. In today's earnings press release, we detail many key assumptions underpinning our fiscal 2017 outlook of $13.30 to $13.80 per diluted share, which excludes anticipated FY 2017 cost alignment plan charges of $40 million to $50 million, equating to approximately $0.12 to $0.15 per diluted share. I'll now refer you to slide 12 in the supplemental presentation, which outlines our anticipated year-over-year baseline earnings growth. Our fiscal 2017 guidance of $13.30 to $13.80 provides baseline earnings growth of 6% to 10% year over year, which is in line with the fiscal 2017 preliminary outlook we provided back in January. Thank you, and with that I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Vicki?
Operator: Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hi, good evening and thank you very much for all the details in the supplemental slides. It's very, very helpful, so two questions here. So first of all, when we think about all the headwinds and tailwinds, what do you guys think of for the normalized EBIT growth going forward in absence of benefit from generic inflation excluding M&A? Is the baseline EBIT growth of about 5% that you delivered in the quarter for the Distribution segment, is that a good way for us to think of what a normalized EBIT growth rate should look like?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Ricky, for the question. I think the best way for us to think about this is really related to post the challenges we faced this year from the lapping of the generic price phenomena we experienced last year as well as the customer consolidations and the negative mix change associated with those customers. We think once we lap those changes and we get through this fiscal year, you should begin to see us perform at a level that's very similar to the level we performed at in the past. We don't really see anything structural in our business or in our business model that would cause us to be concerned about our ability to grow organically in a way that's very similar to the way we've grown in the past. Now clearly in FY 2018, we also have the transition with Rite Aid, and obviously you see us making lots of moves now to prepare to grow through those challenges. But we'll talk about that more as the time approaches. But other than that additional headwind that we'll face in that fiscal year, I think the business continues to perform as it has in the past.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then one follow-up question that we're getting is really about how you think about branded inflation and how you factor that into your guidance. Obviously, we've heard a lot and we talked a lot about the generic pricing impact. But it happens to be that in the summer manufacturers don't take the same level of price increases that they have in the past. Is that somewhat factored within your guidance range? Thank you.
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: As we've thought about branded price increases, we've assumed that they would be modestly below the levels that occurred in fiscal 2016. So we feel as though we've made a prudent assumption in that regard as well.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Operator: We'll go next to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you. John, I just want to follow up to a comment that you just made. You said fiscal 2018 you plan to grow through the Rite Aid challenge. As we think about the acquisitions that you've made and you think about the cost cuts that you're doing, et cetera, is it fair to say – and I know you're going to say it's really early to think about 2018. But is it fair to say that you think that you've set this up so that even with the challenge of Rite Aid you'll be able to grow in 2018?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: It is early to talk about 2018. I would say that we talked a lot about the cost reduction programs we've put in place and the quick action we've taken to streamline the organization and to make sure we maintain our efficiencies. We don't really see any structural changes in our business that cause us great concern. And obviously, the one unusual event is the pending sale of Rite Aid. And it's our objective certainly to find a way to grow through that. But I hesitate to provide any forward guidance into FY 2018, but I can tell you that certainly is our intent, and we're working hard to make sure that that happens.
Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: That's very helpful. And then I guess my follow-up would just be around the incremental cash flow you saw towards the end of this fiscal year and the cash flow going into next year. Is there something unusual in the business or anything that's changing that's really providing this nice tailwind around cash flow?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I'll let James jump in here in just a minute, but we clearly have the organization focused on doing what's right and balancing our objective to grow our earnings but also to manage our cash and to grow our cash flow along the way. So I think the team is very focused, and you're seeing some results from that focus. And, James, you might want to talk...
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I was obviously pleased with the cash flow growth in fiscal 2016, very much driven both by the profit growth as well as this ongoing focus that we've had right across our businesses, both distribution and technology around working capital management. And we think there's more opportunity to continue to build this level in fiscal 2017, as we indicated in our guide. It is important to remember, though, that the guide that I was referring to excluded that $270 million of cash outflows that we would expect to incur in fiscal 2017, driven by two things, the cost alignment plan and then the DEA payment.
Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thank you for the comments.
Operator: We'll go next to Charles Rhyee with Cowen.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the questions. John, if we can go back to the earlier question around actually the brand inflation, I think you made the comment that you take some assumptions for it. But can you talk about that actually in relation to your fee-for-service contracts, in terms of what's embedded on how much changes in inflation can affect how your fee-for-service contracts may work, or actually how you get paid for in terms of fee-for-service? Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks for the question, Charles. We have a longstanding tradition of building value with our manufacturing partners, both on the generic as well as on the branded and specialty sides of our business. Our relationship with the branded manufacturers has remained pretty consistent for a long time now. And I would say that our proportion of earnings that comes through price change in the branded portfolios has remained relatively constant as well, and it is a small portion of our overall branded profit arrangement. Most of our profits are covered under a more fixed arrangement that is pretty reliable regardless of what happens with price inflation, and there's a small portion that we talked about in that 20% plus or minus range that has some price inflation effect on it.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: And just to follow up, would you – when you talk about when you embed your assumptions around it, do you guys also take into the political climate? Obviously, we're in an election year. Do you try to factor some of that into your assumptions as well as we think about the coming year?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure, we're not oblivious to the conversations that are going on in the media and with the current political activity, and we're certainly not oblivious to the investigations and conversations that have been going on from a Congressional perspective into these areas. I think our assumptions are reasonable and they're based on our historical work with the manufacturers. They're certainly buffered by what we see as the current climate. So I would say that as we stated them today, we believe these assumptions are realistic and are likely to occur in the way we've laid them out in our fiscal 2017 guidance.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Eric Percher with Barclays.
Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. I'd like to return to cash flow. So given the increase in cash flow that we see, maybe a little bit of focus on what your plans are for that cash. James, I'd love to hear your view of leverage and where you'll be post-financing, maybe some of the maturities that come up this year, minimal cash balance in the EU and U.S., and how you're looking to put cash to work this year?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Eric, certainly we remain committed to our portfolio approach to capital deployment. I think you know that well. That's the four elements of internal capital spending, M&A, dividends, and share buybacks. And one of the themes of this past fiscal year was that we deployed all four levers of that portfolio approach. Now that said, we've also indicated in the past and maintain a preference for value-creating M&A, if we can find good alternatives versus share buybacks. And so clearly, we've made some nice progress on that recently. Yes, in terms of overall leverage, we've made significant progress in the last 12 months with debt maturities, bringing down the gross debt level that we entered into to finance the Celesio acquisition a couple of years ago. So we've brought ourselves an additional level of financial flexibility as a result of doing that, and I think that's been very important. But I also indicated in my script that as we think about closing on some of the acquisitions in the coming several months or so, expect us to be raising some additional debt in order to be able to accomplish those closings as well. So you'll see us I think using our debt capacity in a way very much consistent with our investment-grade credit rating and sticking with our portfolio approach to capital deployment, with an emphasis on looking for strong acquisitions as we've done in recent months that we think can continue to grow our cash flow and earnings over time.
Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And at this point, we had talked about 3% to 4% earnings growth from capital deployment. It appears that has perhaps been achieved already. Is that a fair statement?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I think it's a fair statement. I'd say we're modestly above the top end of that range that we indicated preliminarily back in January.
Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thanks for the questions. It feels a little unnatural to be asking so many around branded – on the branded side over the generic side, but here goes. It seems, like you guys are assuming, you had mentioned less inflation of the branded side in 2017 than you saw at 2016. Just to be clear, is that because you're already seeing less price increases in the market to date, or is this just more conservatism that you're baking into fiscal 2017? And I guess just within that, anything specifically you're seeing around specialty pricing trends today than what you're assuming within specialty would be helpful.
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: On the branded side, I just wanted to emphasize that our assumption is a prudent one. It's not based on anything that we've seen. Obviously, we're very early in the year. But as John was indicating in his last answer, we're obviously watchful of the political environment and so forth. So that would be how I would address the branded price. The other part of your question was?
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Specialty?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: In terms of pricing there?
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: In terms of pricing, yes.
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I'd say that has a relatively modest effect on our business plan. And so that's mostly a fixed-like fee-for-service type of agreement on that side of the business. So I wouldn't draw particular attention to the pricing there.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And I guess just to follow up, it sounds like you guys now expect to realize the procurement run rate in fiscal 2017. So, John, you had mentioned that you're ahead of schedule. I guess just within that, do you think there's more upside beyond that original range as you move through 2017 and into 2018? And then if you could help us level-set what the run rate was leaving fiscal 2016 around that procurement savings, that would be very helpful.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Obviously, we made significant progress since the acquisition of Celesio to accomplish the objective that we had laid out when we made the acquisition to begin with. And you might recall that the synergy between $275 million and $325 million was quite additive to the existing run rate of margin and profit coming out of the Celesio business on its own without these additional global synergies. So I am very pleased with the progress the team has made. And as you might imagine, in all of our McKesson businesses, last year's result is not good enough for next year. So we are certainly pushing our organizations to continue to make progress on all the dimensions within our businesses to improve. But clearly the magnitude of improvement left available us to in global procurement is larger than realized, and now it will be more incremental improvement on that baseline.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, great. Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Operator: We'll go next to George Hill with Deutsche Bank.
George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good afternoon, guys, two quick questions. First, an easy one for James. Any chance you would quantify the EPS impact or the step down of generic introductions in fiscal 2017 versus fiscal 2016?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We're assuming that that would be a relatively modest figure. Again, I wouldn't want to overdo that point.
George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, and then one for John. John, I'm just interested how you think about the Specialty business as it relates to oncology evolves. You guys have made quite a big bet on oncology, especially with the two most recent acquisitions. And you've got the Medicare Part D demonstration project that's out there that seems to have everybody upset. I guess do you guys feel like that you're protected around the business investments that you've made in specialty? And I would just love your thoughts on how you think the oncology business evolves, both from a benefit perspective and from a business perspective.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think clearly there are two parts to that question, the evolution of the oncology business and how we feel about our position in oncology. And the second part of the question was really related to the demonstration project that has some people concerned. As to the demonstration project, it really has no material effect on our business as a demonstration. And frankly, even if it's rolled out in its current form, which we don't think necessarily is in the best interest of patients or oncologists in this country, it would still be relatively immaterial to our corporation. Clearly, we are very focused on helping our oncology practice partners, whether they're in our network or they are customers of ours, become more efficient, improve the profitability of their practices. But the fundamental strategy for us is to be well positioned as a corporation for what we believe is a continued significant launch cycle for new oncology treatments, including drugs and other protocols, the increase in the rate of cancer patients in this country, and to be positioned to help our community oncology practices thrive in an environment where they can demonstrate already a lower cost, equal or better outcomes, and clearly better flexibility for the patients that they serve. And so when you see us combine our efforts in not only our existing businesses but with these new acquisitions, we're really focused on making sure that we have a wide variety of offerings for the clinician to use when they're making decisions about the appropriate patient care. And I might also mention that CMS has other programs underway, and McKesson participates very heavily in those pilot programs to make sure that we're helping to demonstrate new ways to treat patients, new ways to develop value-based cost and quality-oriented outcomes. And we're excited to be working with all the payers in those areas because we think we can do a great job in the community and that, frankly, we're in a better position to deliver better cost and better value and better outcomes than many other constituents.
George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Garen Sarafian with Citigroup.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks for taking the questions. The first one is a follow-up to the prior question, so a bit different way of asking it. So in terms of the generic launches for your upcoming year, you made a similar statement a year ago. So I was more interested in the relative difference from the step-down last year versus the step-down this year. So on a relative basis, does it turn from a tailwind to a headwind type of a question?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I'm not sure that there's very much I can add at this point. One observation I would make is that the launches that we see in fiscal 2017 have more of a profile that will drive a lesser profit contribution for us. And that's because we see the likelihood that there would be more exclusive type launches than has been the case in some other years. So that's really the driver of the 2017 over 2016 effect.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it, okay. And then second question is one of your peers mentioned reimbursement pressures of clients. Could you maybe discuss what you're seeing from your various customer segments within distribution, any recent trends? And if so, what does guidance assume for the upcoming 12 months?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: In terms of our guide, I wouldn't point to anything material in terms of our logic around changes in reimbursement. We feel comfortable with overall sets of puts and takes that go around any guided range. And we feel as though we've got the ability to be able to execute against that range based on a variety of different types of business conditions that may or may not arise.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Fair enough, thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: Good morning – good afternoon, sorry. So I guess as we think about your strategy on the pharmacy side, obviously you've made again some acquisitions there internationally. I guess as we think about your experience so far with Lloyds and what you've learned and how you think about that as a long-term vehicle of driving value at McKesson as one of the key pillars, what are the key things you've learned that are maybe different than your perception, even though obviously, you service them in the U.S., about how the international pharmacy markets differ? And then how do you view that business model relative to your overall mix?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We're excited about the performance that we've achieved with Lloyds and the evolution of the pharmacy business in Europe in particular, given that it is extremely well positioned to be a big part of the healthcare system in many of those countries, in particular in the UK, where healthcare demand outstrips supply and where governments and other payers are looking for lower cost alternatives and vehicles to serve their populations and certainly ways to reduce the queueing that goes on in the larger health systems by using a pharmacist as another expert, as a provider in the healthcare system. And so we're excited about Lloyds being positioned as a destination for healthcare services. We are trying to carve a position with our pharmacy strategy, frankly, around the world that is more focused on being in the care process as opposed to some of the other avenues that some of these retail stores can take. And so I think we're pleased with where we're positioned in Europe, and we're also pleased with where we're headed in Canada, and we're excited to bring many of these benefits to our independent pharmacy customers, either through our banner programs or just through close partnerships.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: Great. Thanks, John.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: We'll go next to David Larsen with Leerink Partners.
David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC: Hi. Expanding on that last question a bit, can you talk about some of the organic growth opportunities that you see for Celesio over in Europe potentially becoming an intermediary between hospitals or manufacturers, or anything along those lines? Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Clearly, I just talked about Lloyds and how we think Lloyds both in our own stores and also in our banner stores in many different markets is well positioned to participate in the care process in a broader way and more comprehensive way. Now clearly, the hospital business and the specialty business in many markets in Europe is managed directly between the manufacturers and the large health systems. We believe that both the manufacturers and the governments and others that operate these enterprises would be much better off if McKesson was in the middle through Celesio trying to provide the streamlined supply chain and information stream that we do here in the United States. And we continue to make acquisitions in Europe that better position us in adjacencies outside of retail pharmacy. So we think that there are opportunities for us to grow our footprint, and you see us continue to invest in our infrastructure of Celesio so that we're prepared to do that. I think we have time for one last question.
Operator: We'll take our last question from Dave Francis with RBC Capital Markets.
David Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hi, John. Thanks for squeezing me in. Real quick on the strategic front, can you talk a little bit about how the Rexall transaction reflects any change in your acquisition or business development philosophy as it relates to the retail footprint for McKesson in North America? Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We try to be leaders in the businesses that we are participating in, and that's our objective. And so when we see an opportunity for us to lead in the market with a business, that becomes attractive to us. We believe both in Canada as well as in parts of Europe, we have an opportunity to be number one or number two in the retail market. And we have the ability to bring that expertise to the rest of our customers when we partner closely with them, sometimes through ownership and sometimes not, in a way that builds value. As it relates to the U.S., which is where some of these questions sometimes go, we don't see a real vertical opportunity in the U.S. that would allow us to create that leadership position as being number one or number two in the U.S. marketplace. So clearly, our strategy here in retail is to align very closely with people that we believe are great business partners that are also winning in their sections of the market and stand clearly with independent pharmacies and other chains that are focused on having us help them in a more material way. So I think that that captures our strategy as it relates to retail. Thank you for that question, Dave.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: And I want to thank you, Vicki, for your help with the call. I want to thank also all of you for your time today. I do think we presented a very solid operating plan for fiscal 2017. I'm excited about the growth opportunities that I see across all of McKesson. And I'm certainly proud of our track record at delivering value to our customers and strong financial returns for our shareholders. And once again, I want to thank all of our employees for a very strong fiscal 2016 and a very positive plan for fiscal 2017, and thank you all for your time again. Erin?
Erin Lampert - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, John. We will participate in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Healthcare Conference in Las Vegas on May 11. We look forward to seeing you in the new fiscal year. Thank you and goodbye.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert, Senior Vice-President, Investor Relations.
Erin Lampert: Thank you, Mellissa. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2016 Third Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO, and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a brief business update and will then introduce James who will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal Securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current, and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results the amortization of acquisition related intangible assets, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, and LIFO related adjustments. We also refer to certain non-GAAP measures calculated on a constant currency basis. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for our investors. Please refer to our press release announcing third quarter fiscal 2016 results available on our website for a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Additional information on constant currency effects is available in our SEC reports. Thank you. And here's John Hammergren.
John Hammergren: Thanks, Erin, and thanks everyone for joining us on our call. As we had an opportunity to speak with many of our investors since we last provided an update just a few weeks ago on January 11, I'll keep my remarks fairly brief this afternoon. In a moment, I'll turn the call over to James and he will walk you through our results for the third quarter. But before I do, I have three key messages I want to leave you with today. First, there have been no changes to the fiscal 2016 outlook and preliminary fiscal 2017 outlook, which we provided on January 11. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.60 to $12.90 for fiscal 2016. Second, our third quarter results were right in line with our revised expectations. I'm proud of the excellent progress we've made in expanding our global pharmaceutical sourcing scale delivering operating margin improvements in our Technology Solutions segment and successfully executing on the Celesio acquisition synergies. And third, I have great confidence in our future. As we enter the final months of fiscal 2016 and look to the future, I am as confident as ever in our industry and the unique role we play in making the business of healthcare more efficient. I'm confident McKesson, our focus on innovation in our customer first mindset has repelled us to be leaders in the markets we serve. And most important, I'm confident in the extraordinary team we have at McKesson were truly the best in the business. Our businesses are very well positioned, both domestically and internationally. And we have a tremendously strong balance sheet, which we will continue to deploy affectively and strategically to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. Year-to-date we repurchased approximately $850 million of our common stock. We paid nearly $1 billion of long-term debt and made internal capital investments at $417 million and paid a $179 million in dividends. We ended the third quarter with approximately $3.4 billion in cash and our expectation to deliver cash flow from operations of approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2016 remains unchanged from our original guidance. With that, I'll turn the call over to James to review our third quarter results and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?
James Beer: Thank you, John. And good afternoon, everyone. As John discussed earlier, we provided our updated view on fiscal 2016 earnings on January 11 and we continue to expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.60 to $12.90. Our results this quarter are consistent with our revised expectations. I will now review our third quarter consolidated financial results. As a reminder, Schedule 3 of the accompanying tables to our press release includes supplemental constant currency information to outline both the dollar and percentage impact of currency movements on our reported results. During the third quarter and the first nine months of our fiscal 2016, our reported adjusted earnings per diluted share included currency headwinds of approximately $0.03 and $0.11, respectively. Therefore during my prepared remarks, I will reference both the reported and constant currency figures. Now, let's move to our results for the third quarter. My remarks today will focus on our third quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $3.18, which excludes three items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, and LIFO-related adjustments. Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedule 2 and 3. Consolidated revenues increased 3% for the quarter to $47.9 billion. Revenues were negatively impacted by $1.1 billion as a result of foreign currency rate movements. On a constant currency basis revenues were $49 billion, an increase of 5% led by growth in our Distribution Solutions segment. Adjusted gross profit for the quarter decreased by 3% to $2.9 billion. On a constant currency basis, adjusted gross profit was flat to the prior year driven by the performance of distribution solutions, primarily reflecting the impact of a weaker year-over-year profit contribution from generic pricing trends offset by growth across our other domestic and international businesses, and continued progress on procurement synergies related to our acquisition of Celesio. Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.8 billion were down 5% for the quarter on a reported basis and down 1% on a constant currency basis driven by diligent cost management in both segments and the sales of our nurse triage and ZEE Medical businesses earlier in the fiscal year. Adjusted other income was $14 million for the quarter. Interest expense of $87 million decreased 6% on a reported basis and 5% in constant currency. Now moving to taxes, this quarter's adjusted tax rate of 25.5% was driven by both a favorable mix of income and certain favorable discreet tax items which totaled approximately $0.07 primarily reflecting recent Celesio first of changes in both the U.S. and Europe during the third quarter. For the full year we continued to expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 29.5%. Adjusted income for the quarter was $739 million with our adjusted earnings per diluted share at $3.18 up 9% on a reported basis and up 10% in constant currency. Wrapping up our consolidated results for the third quarter diluted weighted average shares decreased 2% year-over-year to $232 million. During the third quarter we completed a share repurchase of common stock totaling $350 million. In fiscal year-to-date we have repurchased approximately $850 million in common stock. Overall we expect to continue our portfolio approach to capital deployment which reflects a mixture of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends and we continue to expect our weighted average diluted shares outstanding will be $233 million for the full fiscal year. Now let’s turn to the segment results which can be found on Schedules 3A and 3B. Distribution Solutions segment revenues of $47.2 billion were up 3% on a reported basis. Revenues were negatively impacted by $1.1 billion as a result of foreign currency rate movements. Constant currency revenues were $48.3 billion for the third quarter reflecting growth of 6%. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $39.6 billion in the third quarter, up 6% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis. Third quarter revenues primarily reflecting market growth in our U.S. pharmaceutical Specialty and Canadian businesses offset primarily by the expiration of a customer contract at the start of the third quarter. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6 billion for the third quarter. International revenues were impacted by approximately $700 million in unfavorable currency rate movements, primarily attributable to a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar when compared to the prior year. Adjusting for this currency impact, revenues were approximately $6.7 billion in the third quarter, down 1% on a constant currency basis, primarily reflecting the loss of a hospital contract in Norway during fiscal 2015 partially offset by continued growth in our U.K. business. Medical-Surgical revenues were flat year-over-year, primarily driven by market growth in our primary care business offset by the sale of the ZEE Medical business in the second quarter. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit of $2.5 billion decreased 3% on a reported basis and increased 1% on a constant currency basis to $2.6 billion. Overall the third quarter adjusted gross profit reflected our mix of business including a growing proportion of specialty pharmaceuticals, a weaker profit contribution from generic pricing trends when compared to the prior year and continued progress on driving Celesio related procurement synergies. Adjusted operating expense for the segment decreased 5% for the quarter on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis segment operating expense was flat year-over-year, primarily driven by expense management and the sale of the ZEE Medical business during the second quarter. Segment adjusted operating profit of $1.1 billion was flat on a reported basis and grew 2% on a constant currency basis. The segment adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 224 basis points, a decline of 8 basis points year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, the segment margin declined 9 basis points primarily driven by the adjusted gross profit result. Generic pricing trends are anticipated to be weaker during the second half of our fiscal year as we on outlined on January, 11. Therefore, we now expect the Distribution Solution segment adjusted operating margin to be relatively flat to the prior year. Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were down 8% for the quarter to $694 million. This decline was primarily driven by the sale of our nurse triage business in the first quarter, and the anticipated revenue softness of the Horizon Clinical software platform, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses. During the quarter, adjusted operating expenses in the segment decreased 7% on a reported basis and 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by our ongoing expense management efforts and the sales of nurse triage business. Third quarter adjusted operating profit for the segment increased 7% to $133 million. And the adjusted operating margin rate was approximately 19%, representing an increase of 274 basis points versus the prior year. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit increased 2% representing an adjusted operating margin increase of 180 basis points versus the prior year. This increase was driven by strong performance in our Payer Solutions and Relay Connectivity and Medical Imaging businesses. For the full year, we now expect the adjusted operating margin for the segment to be in the low 20% range. Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. As you heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days, sales outstanding were relatively flat at 26 days. Our days sales in inventories increased by 2 days to 33 days. Our days sales in payables increased by 3 days to 54 days. We generated $566 million in cash flow from operations during the first 9 months of fiscal 2016. And for the full year, we continue to expect our cash flow from operations to be approximately $3 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.4 billion, with $2.4 billion held offshore. For the 9 months ending December 31, we had $417 million of internal capital spending, repurchased approximately $850 million in common stock, repaid approximately $1 billion in long term debt and paid a $179 million in dividends. Now I’ll turn to our adjusted EPS outlook for the year. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to expect fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.60 to $12.90. Our outlook assumes a full year average exchange rates of $1.10 per euro which is unchanged from our prior guidance. In addition, we now expect $1.27 per share in amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and $0.31 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. We also expect between $0.72 and $0.82 per share in LIFO related adjustments. In summary, McKesson delivered results consistent with our revised expectations for the quarter. Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, we expect to leverage the core operational strength and scale of our leading global businesses and our longstanding portfolio approach to capital deployment to create value for our shareholders, customers and business partners. Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Melissa?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser: First question is on kind of a distribution segment operating margin. When we look at gross for the North America business in a normalized basis about up 7% year-over-year, it's kind of like the disclosed level that we've seen since fiscal year '14. So should we think about this as kind of a new market growth for the segment and is HCV kind of like the key factor there that kind of like contributed to that mid teen growth in last 18 months that we should – that have kind of like normalized and will do so going forward?
James Beer: Well, the first part of your question I would expect that is our normal cause give you more of a steer for FY17 margins when we do our update in early May. So as it relates to what is being impacting the margin thus far is obviously, we've spoken extensively about the impact for generic price increases. And that's really being the driver of that margin results the DS function. Could you just repeat the second part of the question?
Ricky Goldwasser: Yes. The question was really not about the margin, it was more about the topline for distribution solution for North America. It's kind of like up 7% in the last kind of like 18 months, we've seen this growth in kind of like low to mid and even high teens. So the question really is the two parts toward, like forward looking is 7% the new growth rate and then when you look at what's driving the slow down, is it kind of like did you seen an abnormal growth from HCV?
John Hammergren: We had a – Ricky, this is John. We had a very large - we have a very large customers in the mail business that had some significant year-over-year progress in terms of customer winds. You saw us benefit from a revenue perspective that help pushes into the double digits in addition to the launches of some of these specialty drugs. So the combination of those two events were probably the things that propelled us from the revenue perspective. The 7% from my perspective at least now is more consistent with what we think the market underlying growth rates are probably running out today. Obviously, there are some minor changes in what we might see from a mix perspective and I think to James' point is probably little premature for us to talk about FY17 revenue forecast. But I think we're probably going to grow like we are today in line with the market. It's just a question of any customer changes that might happen during the year either customers of ours that are winning or losing business or when on occasions sometimes we lose a piece of business like we did with a large mail to customers just recently.
Ricky Goldwasser: Okay. And then just one follow-up on the gross profit margins – actually third quarter gross profit came in a little bit better than we've kind of like expected and seems – you still seeing kind of like benefit from kind of like buy side margin. So when we think about the new guidance that you provided few weeks ago, should we think about kind of like this quarter to third quarter it's kind of like the last quarter, we should think about modeling is like seeing a benefit on the buy side from generic information. And from this point on we should think like a bad, like a slowdown or like modulated, like the 0% that you've highlighted a few weeks ago?
John Hammergren: Well, I would emphasize our view around a generic price inflation was normal, so not zero, but certainly modest – certainly significantly down from when we came into this fiscal year with much higher expectations.
James Beer: So there is really no change in what we said to you on January 11. Things are coming through as we had sort of expected.
Operator: Thank you. We'll next go to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Jones: On the administrative cost structure review, you guys shared earlier this month. Just looking back over the last few years and trying to adjust for acquisitions like PSS and Celesio. It looks to us that SG&A has grown somewhere in the 10% range per year. As we think about the cost structure review and some of the client attrition, you've experienced over the last year. How should we think about the right level of annual SG&A growth? Just any progress you guys have made. I know it's early, but any progress you've made in that review details behind it will be helpful for us.
John Hammergren: Well, it is early in our work. Obviously, this is something that we did embed within the preliminary guide that we offered a couple of weeks ago for fiscal '17. But we're going through the detailed work now. We do think that there is opportunity and I've noted before that that opportunity would likely drive a one-time charge in Q4 of the current quarter. And will be able to hence provide an update in May. But certainly we feel that there is some opportunity.
James Beer: And Robert, I think it's probably fair to say that looking at our SG&A without all of the acquisition noise that comes in and goes out and certainly currency fluctuation are really – if you look at our internal numbers in our calculations, our SG&A is normally growing in the low single digit kind of range. So we typically don't average at 10% increase in SG&A that would be way outside the boundaries if you look on base core expense kind of trajectory it's nowhere near that. So I think you might see some abnormalities occasionally because of M&A and how that flows through, as well as some of those currency stuff that I think overtime you should expect our SG&A to grow more that single digit rates, once we get passed at some of this work we're doing today on administrative costs.
Robert Jones: Got it. I guess there is lot of focus on the pharma business maybe just on medical. It looks like it was essentially flat revenue growth there both sequentially and year-over-year. I think originally what you guys are talking about mid-single digit type growth for this year. So I guess what's changed relative to your original expectations and then any thoughts about the trajectory of the medical business growth from here will be helpful.
James Beer: With medical surgical revenues, we updated our guide quarter or so ago to be low to mid single digit revenue growth and that was driven by our sale of ZEE Medical. So we talked also about the strength of the primarily care business within medical surgical. And there were some challenges on the extended care side, but overall we're very pleased with the continued development of the business.
John Hammergren: I think you have to net it for ZEE that's probably the thing the most people miss when they look at those numbers. So we don't adjust those out. They are in our adjusted numbers with you and your reflection.
Robert Jones: And nothing changed on the end market side then?
James Beer: No, not really. And we've seen a little bit of weakness in flu, but that's not going to be something you're going to see dampen our overall revenue to significant extent. It really is the sale of ZEE.
Operator: We'll next go to Steven Valiquette with UBS.
Steven Valiquette: I guess for me just a quick question on the expected anti-trust litigation settlement gain for fiscal '17 that you alluded to a few weeks ago. And that extra $70 million year-over-year adds an extra $0.20 or $0.25 in fiscal '17 that we assume normal tax rate, which is fine. But just, is there any chance you can walk through the drivers of aerodynamic so what's going on there just to better understand. And why those gains were greater fiscal '17.
John Hammergren: These things come through in unforecastable and sometimes lumpy fashions. It's really is just a single settlement. It's quite large by comparison to others that we receive and certainly by comparison to other years, so I think that’s really it.
James Beer: Yes. And the case is quite far along, which is why we felt it was sensible to make an assumption that we would enjoy that $140 million benefit in fiscal '17.
Steven Valiquette: The other real quick on is just the $0.85 that you talked about for - you're heading fiscal '17 from a combination of a generic pricing and customer transitions. Obviously, we're still getting a lot of calls on that. Is there any chance that you're willing to maybe give just a bit more color just size wise on the magnitude of one of those buckets versus the other within that $0.85 at this stage or you still going to perhaps hold off on it till later.
John Hammergren: Well, I'd like to say that the majority of that $0.85 has being driven by generic price increases changes.
Operator: We’ll next go to George Hill with Deutsche Bank.
George Hill: John shifting gears little bit given the kind of recent pull back in the market assets would seem to be more attractively valued right now. I guess can you talk little about whether or not the company feels pressured to put capital to work and are on the capital deployment strategy may be talk about the appetite for increasing the companies leverage ratio and the appetite for deals that might add another leg to the store something that might be more transformational as it relates to the business.
John Hammergren: Well, thanks for the question, it clearly - we try not to feel pressure on any dimension because it may cause you do something that doesn’t make sense. Having said that, as our balance sheet is become healthier and we paid off some of the debt and made the commitments that we said we would make relative to de-levering after Celesio, we are very aware of the fact that we now have expanded opportunity to deploy our balance sheet in a portfolio way and we planned to continued to do so. I would say that, the fluctuation and evaluations does make some opportunities more attractive than others and clearly even some of the private companies have might have dreamed of IPOs et cetera may be more available to a conversation with us than they might have been otherwise. And as it relates to putting leverage back on the company, I think the fact that we were able to lever up and then de-lever again give us creditability with making our commitments a reality and I think that the issue of another leg on the stool or transformational deal and clearly we look at any deal that make sense to its financially and strategically. I don’t think we push anything away from the table. But having said that, synergies are usually more possible on deals that in more line of side on deals that are in one of the segment that were currently participating in. And so I would tell you that our buyers is to go into businesses that we currently understand and operate as suppose to something that’s for a field when the synergies are based on some expectation that the markets are going to be more attractive whether going to grow faster and we use we can add lot to those values if we don’t have synergies to bring into the transaction.
George Hill: And then may be just a quick follow up again we’ll kick and hit the generics topic again. You guys have pretty modest expectations for generic price inflation in fiscal 17 but lot of the back - the drivers they drove generic price inflation haven’t changed much. I guess can you talk about, can you give us any color on what you’re saying in the channel on what's driving the diminished rate of change and inflation and I guess I’m looking for more anecdotal information that helps us kind of see what’s going on in the market there. Thank you.
John Hammergren: You may recall that we talked about generic inflation in the past, we talked about the fact that is driven by a small number of molecules from a small number of manufactures that have inflated to very high degree and I’d say that our current experiences at some of those out layer increases have diminished significantly. But overall if you think about the portfolio overtime it has been in more of a deflationary mode so we talk about inflation. We really talking about the net effect of inflation on our business driven by those molecules not the overall portfolio inflating or deflating because that typically deflates. We think that its – we’re in a period now where we’re going to have modest inflation that’s what we’ve been experiencing, that’s what we talked about in January 11, and that’s what we anticipate for the rest of this fiscal year and into next fiscal years is modest generic inflation.
Operator: We’ll next go to Lisa Gill of JPMorgan.
Lisa Gill: John, few weeks ago we talked about the incremental opportunity to add incremental generic procurement deals. I think you talked about the fact that you've done some Safeway are hold [ph] and some others. But can may be just remind us of what you see as incremental opportunities that are still available to you within your own book of business out in the marketplace?
John Hammergren: Well, clearly we have made significant progress in helping our customers procure generics more affectively and use our distribution channel to bring them to their stores at a more cost effective way as well. And so I think we’ve have seen progress you mentioned our hold and Albertson's Safeway and many of our independent customers have continued to join us in the generic procurement side and have become more and more reliant on the customs ability to help them reduce their cost and improve their performance. Our Health Mart stores are now above 45,00 stores and that program has been extremely successful in driving generics and our proprietary generics programs are still growing in healthy double digit kind of ranges. So overall I think we continue to make progress. Some of our largest customers still procure some are all of their generics on their own, through their own distribution network and do their own sourcing activities and we continue to have conversations with those customers about the value of using McKesson’s combined power with their to do an even better job and those conversations obviously are important to us as we think about the relationship of these customers. It would be premature for me to talk about specifically which customers we think might provide the most opportunity but I don’t think the table isn’t run yet relative to opportunity for us.
Lisa Gill: Is there a way to quantify that number of may be using analogy of – if you want to use to baseball at innings as far as how penetrated you are in your current book just so we can think about as we move into '17 and '18 beyond what the potential incremental opportunities are as it pertains to these hyper generic procurement relationships.
James Beer: I will say the opportunities not in significant and many of you have talked to us about specific customers that you know are continuing to procure a large majority of their generics on their own. And so I think it's not an material impact in front of us if we’re able to persuade these customers with the data that we have that our procurement activity would be beneficial to them. I’m hesitant to describe it in innings, including customer count. We’ve got a lot of customers using us today but in customer value based on the size of their generic spend their significant opportunity left for us.
Lisa Gill: And then just my follow-up would just be both sounds well, as well as UDT now in a second review process. Was that your initial expectation and how should we think about the timeline of closing those two acquisitions.
John Hammergren: Our initial expectation was at the regulation, regulatory process would be extended and follow about the pattern that we have seen before in this country and I think we’ll remain extremely optimistic that these transactions are examined through their process that we will stand a very good chance of accomplishing the acquisitions in large and reform that we had expected when we announced them. And then answer to your earlier question also Lisa relative to procurement, I might also point out that the opportunities for us extend beyond just the U.S. and many times customers look - you look at customers that you know of in the U.S. that are buying on their own but there are also customer buying on their own in other important markets for us where we and they have the ability to dispense to generic that we’ve sourced together. And so I think that we remain very optimistic with our global activity and our procurement programs will continue to grow.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from David Larsen with Leerink.
David Larsen: Can you please talk about the competitive environment. So when you got a market and bid for a new pieces of business, how is the pricing environment now that we’ve got, couple of large JVs that are in the market, with like Red Oak and Rite Aid. Can you sort of talk about, what the pricing environment looks like? Has there been a significant shift in 2015, 2016 relative to previous years or not. Thanks.
John Hammergren: It's difficult Dave to comment on pricing because it's sort of in the lands of where we are currently doing business and where we’re competing for business. I would say that overall the business remains competitive but stabilized. I don’t see a lot of customer changes that would drive one to believe that there is something going on the materially different from a pricing perspective out in the marketplace. I can speak for McKesson's strategy and that is we continue to focus heavily on our selling efforts within our existing customer base trying to find ways to add more value to those relationships and through that value added create a relationship that has more stability but it also provides a better profit for our customers and better profit for McKesson as we evolve these partnerships. And so I think our principle focus is in the area of expanding our footprint with the existing customers and helping them perform better.
Operator: We’ll next go to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.
Ross Muken: So may be just quickly we saw some headlines last week or so on some core rulings in Germany. Can you just remind us sort of where we are with the Celesio staff and the process let there, sort of determine whether or not you, we’ll get to kind of ultimately acquire the remaining portion and how we should think about the purchase price?
James Beer: Well, first of all, we own around 76% of Celesio and for the other 24 points or so of the ownership, they have a put to us. We do not have a call on those shares outstanding. As to the news these past few days related to suit that Magnetar had brought that we had previously seen dismissed at the local court level if you will, back in December of 2014. That decision was appealed by Magnetar. It did get overturn just a few days ago. We are planning to appeal that decision and I would expect that process to play-out over a year or more. And given the issues specific to this case, I think it is unlikely that McKesson will be required to pay what some have been extrapolating as the substantial liability, the case at hand related quite narrowly to a few shares that had been put to us. And so the court decision related to around €260,000 total. We see an extrapolation from that figure up into the €370 million range. I would not expect given the specifics of the case and the process around German law, that we would be looking at that sort of payment.
John Hammergren: And I'd also point out to this obviously, there is no effect on the operating control we’ve already established with Celesio. There is really no effect on our financial statements other than this potential cash liability but the - we consolidated their earnings, we operate the company and to James' point, this outstanding share are remain outstanding and can be put to us when they decide they want to put them to us.
Ross Muken: And just quickly on the Rite Aid front. Can you just help us think through, sort of, how you have to game plan for an outcome there? I mean, obviously you are not be going to able to share with us, sort of, what the discussions go like [indiscernible]. I’m just trying to think practically in terms of, as you have to have that decision tree of what the various options are, how quickly, if the business ultimately transitions this year, next year whenever, how quickly you can adjust your cost structure? How flexible it is and what are these sort of things we should look for to best understand, how that will impact the parts of the P&L.
John Hammergren: First off I’d remind folks that on early January I've made a comment about this business we believe will be retained by McKesson in its current form through late in our fiscal 17 numbers. And so with the guidance we’ve given you for fiscal 17, that range includes that we would - or assumes that we’d continue to enjoy the Rite Aid business in relative its same relative form through that end of that period. Obviously, we could be off, plus or minus depending on what your view of the process by which Walgreens will complete the transaction and how that may actually take shape. I'd say that we were reluctant to ever comment on what a customer might do when the decision is in their hands. I’d say however, you’ve seen certain customers of ours, value the incumbent relationship and continue to enjoy a relationship with McKesson going forward like you do at target at Omnicare where the relationship change from a mix perspective but we are able to retain at least a portion of the business. I would not take that speculation and apply it necessarily to Walgreens but I’d just point that out as certainly an alternative that has some possibility other than that not much I can say Ross.
Operator: We’ll take the next question from Garen Sarafian with Citi Research.
Garen Sarafian: Good afternoon John, James. James first question to you. Could you first repeat what the technology solutions adjusted constant currency margins were for this quarter which I think favorably benefited margins. But even if so, it’s been quite strong year-to-date that you’re not guiding to the 20% margin level for the year. So is there anything unique for us to some of these trends wouldn’t continue into next year?
James Beer: Well, I have been pleased with the operating margin trends in technology solutions in recent quarters and I think it very much reflects the work that the team there has been doing to reorient our focus to specific businesses around our peer solutions, around our transactional type offerings and also our imaging business, as well as our revenue cycle management businesses. So we've really shifted the focus to those areas where we think we have nice growth opportunities and we have solid margins. And that has flowed through in combination with good cost control to allow us to record much stronger margins with the comment that we think for the full year will be in the low 20s. About one point of that margin benefit of course, remember comes from the sale of our care management business a couple of quarters or so ago. So that's really the story on the technology margins. Overall, in constant currency the margin number itself is 20.5%.
Garen Sarafian: 20.5, okay. Great. And then maybe going back to your question that was just asked regarding grade Rite Aid. Previously, you guys have sort of shied away from acquiring to the retail pharmacy space as there could be some conflicts at least in the U.S. that's not present in Europe. So with the potential acquisition in Rite Aid where there is the possibility of a material amount of stores being sold. Are you willing to reconsider that view or would there still be too much of an impact with your remaining retail clients taken through that?
James Beer: I don't think we will be interested in buying the stores. To the extent stores are divested and we would not be interested in buying them. That's not the business we're in in the U.S.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take a question from Eric Coldwell with Baird.
Eric Coldwell: My primary McKesson ones have been covered at this point, but I am curious after many years of waiting we finally got the AMP final rule 658 pages of glory. I'm curious if you and your teams have had a chance to go through that at all. And if there is anything that stands out to you as you think about your business over the next year once that – I guess it goes into affect actually starting fiscal '17 for you, but curious where your thoughts might be if you have any at this point.
John Hammergren: I've read the whole thing several times and highlighted the areas of most interest to me. Obviously, it's still very early to understand all of the implications and to understand the ability of the states to implement this rule. I think that it's likely to be pretty limited in the states that have already largely moved to manage medicate program in recent years. This really is a state medicate fee for service kind of an application and I guess our initial assessment is that we expected to have a fairly limited impact in the supply chain as we see it today.
Operator: We'll next go to Eric Percher with Barclays.
Eric Percher: John, I'd like to go back to the first question where you were asked to pine on 7% as perhaps a going-forward number. When we look at 7% in this quarter and the decline relative to the prior quarters, you mentioned a couple of items, but it's fair to think over the next several quarters we've got a contract movement, we have the sale of assets, FX may become an easier comp going forward. So is it fair to say that that's not reflective of long-term industry growth or how do you think about long-term industry growth today?
John Hammergren: Well, I'm reluctant to make an industry call. You guys are and others are well positioned to do that. Clearly, part of what you have to look at is the amount of generic launches that come out, what kind of price inflation you're going to get on the branded launches. What kind of specialty drugs might hit and when. So there is lot of complexity. I guess what I was attempting to describe was that the relative higher rate that we had in advance of this quarter was driven by some specific customer wins that happen to flow through our P&L and that lapping affect of that success by that customer is what – is comparative that we’re chatting it outside. That makes sense to your - 
Eric Percher: Yes. And as we've gone a couple of weeks into the year as you look at brand inflation trends, have you seen the political discussion translate into any material change in those trends?
John Hammergren: No we really haven't seen any change of any significance in the branded side and I'd say that the results are aligned with our expectations.
Operator: We'll take a question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen.
Charles Rhyee: John, just going back to your expectations on inflation and not only just generic, but also maybe on branded, how you guys are thinking about in terms of this being election year and to the extent that you're seeing sort of a moderating environment. Any thoughts on as to how much you think may be an election cycle is impacting that?
John Hammergren: Well, it's also is difficult to speculate on what the drivers are. We are not the ones making the decision on the generic or the branded side is relative to inflation. I would say the political discourse that's taking place and the congressional inquires relative to pricing practices, I think are obviously going to have people at least pausing perhaps to consider whether now is the right time to take price increase. There obviously are other circumstances related to pricing associated with supply disruption, availability, new product launches. I mean there is all kinds of things that probably play into the calculus here and I would say – I think the political discussions really, clearly and the media discussion probably has some impact to speculate on how much it would be difficult.
Charles Rhyee: That's fair. And then just maybe one quick follow up on that. You mentioned earlier in a response that you're clearly looking at - there is nothing really - you're going to send us few items that kind of really drove some of the inflation that you saw. Historically, you've not really seen that right now. But is there anything structural to the market as you look forward in the next couple of years or something like that couldn't happen again or do you think there has been some changes in the market where it's probably less likely we'll see kind of what we saw maybe the last two years.
John Hammergren: I believe the performance of branded pharmaceutical companies is probably easier to forecast give that it has been less volatile in the last decade than perhaps the generic industry we've seen more volatility. And that volatility certainly is partially driven by supply and disruption. So I would say that if you could forecast what supply disruptions might occur in the future then you might have the ability to at least have some inclinations to what happens with branded price or generic price inflation. I'm really reluctant to speculate on how things may play out. We clearly have given you guidance for the rest of this fiscal year on that dimension of inflation both branded and generic. And we've given you our thoughts relative to fiscal '17 our guidance on those two dimensions. And I think that we stand by our current speculation on that, but it's just that - those views are amongst other views we have to take every year and what might happen throughout the year and we just want to be transparent with you about what we're thinking so. I think that's probably the most I can say about it.
Charles Rhyee: Thanks a lot.
John Hammergren: I understand that we don't have any additional questions in the queue. I know we hit a lot of these subjects in early January and I appreciate all of the attention that you've paid to these matters and others and for your time on the call today. As we entered the final few months of our fiscal year and I look to the future, I'm excited about the opportunities I see for us to continue our lead from an innovation perspective and how we can help our customers meet the many challenges they may face. The fundamental strength of McKesson has long been our ability to constantly adapt and grow during times of change and by staying focused on our customers and through to our core values. I'll now hand the call over to Erin for a review of upcoming events for the financial community.
Erin Lampert: Thank you, John. On February 10, we will present at the Leerink Partners Global Healthcare Conference in New York. We will release our fourth quarter earnings results in May. Thank you and have a good evening.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect. And have a good day.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the McKesson Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert, Senior Vice-President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead
Erin Lampert - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, Audra. Good morning, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2016 Second Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO, and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update and will then introduce James who will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal Securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current, and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results the amortization of acquisition related and intangible assets, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, and LIFO related adjustments. We also refer to certain non-GAAP measures calculated on a constant currency basis. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for investors. Please refer to our press release announcing our second quarter fiscal 2016 results available on our website for a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Additional information on constant currency effects is available in our SEC reports. Thanks, and here's John Hammergren.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Erin, and thanks everyone for joining us on our call. Before I recap our quarter, I want to take a few moments to discuss the issue that must be on everyone's mind: the announcement of Walgreen's acquisition of Rite Aid. We have a very strong relationship with Rite Aid. For many years we've provided distribution services for their brand pharmaceutical volume. When we expanded the relationship last year, Rite Aid was attracted to closer ties to McKesson because of our generic purchasing scale and our sourcing expertise, our leading industry distribution capabilities, including our ability to provide better levels of service to Rite Aid stores and the significant working capital and cash flow benefits available through this closer relationship. Since that time, McKesson has added significant additional scale to our Generics program. Customers want a deeper relationship with McKesson, not only because of the competitiveness of our offering but also because we've built a broad array of customer-centric programs that deliver real value well beyond core distribution. In addition to our relationship with Rite Aid we've also had a strong business relationship with the management team at Walgreens Boots Alliance. We have great respect for what they've accomplished. There's no doubt our industry is going through a period of dynamic change. I've been CEO of this company for 15 years and in healthcare my entire career. I've seen this industry go through transformative change on a number of occasions. I believe one of the fundamental strengths of McKesson has been our ability to constantly adapt and lead during times of change by staying focused on our customers and our true core values. McKesson leaders are the best in the business and we've demonstrated our ability to innovate and to drive consistent and steady growth over many, many years. And I believe we remain exceptionally well positioned across all of our businesses as we look to the future. Now turning to our financial results, for the second quarter we achieved total company revenues of $48.8 billion, up 14%, and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.31, up 20%, both on a constant currency basis. In a moment I'll provide highlights of what was another solid quarter of operating performance across our businesses. But before I do, I will mention a few items that are important to understand with respect to our second quarter results. During the second quarter, we completed the sale of ZEE Medical, a business that was within our McKesson Medical-Surgical business and recorded a gain of $0.14 per diluted share. And we recorded a $25 million favorable tax item in the second quarter as a result of a recent U.S. Tax Court ruling. This drove a benefit of approximately $0.11 per diluted share in the quarter. Excluding these two items, our second quarter results were better than our expectations, primarily driven by the timing of brand price inflation, which occurred earlier in the year than we had anticipated. As well as some favorable timing in our Technology Solutions segment. Overall, I'm pleased with the performance of our business in the second quarter. Coming back to the broader industry environment, pharmaceutical pricing trends have become the frequent subject of news headlines as we get deeper into this presidential election cycle. The observation I would make is that this pharmaceutical pricing discussions tend to ebb and flow over time. However, what remains clear is that pharmaceuticals are still the most effective and affordable way to treat patients. And innovation and drug development and the trend toward higher levels of generic penetration continue to deliver real value and cost savings through the healthcare industry. The desire to tie payments to value and expand medication adherence in a world of fee for value is tremendous. And the issues of quality, access, and cost remain at the center of improving healthcare delivery. And McKesson is extremely well positioned to help our customers not only compete but thrive as they look to the future. Turning now to our business results for the quarter, Distribution Solutions revenues were $48 billion, up 14%, and adjusted operating profit was $1.1 billion, up 11%, both on a constant currency basis. Our North America pharmaceutical distribution and services businesses, which include U.S. Pharmaceutical, McKesson Specialty Health and McKesson Canada, all turned in impressive results with a combined revenue growth of 17% in constant currency. Revenue in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business was ahead of our expectations in the second quarter driven by continued strong growth, primarily from our largest customers, and the timing of certain brand price increases which occurred earlier in the fiscal year than we had previously anticipated. During the second quarter, we were excited to announce our expanded relationship with Albertsons. As you know, we signed a new five-year agreement that includes the sourcing and distribution of both brand and generic pharmaceuticals to Albertsons' network of nearly 1,700 pharmacies in the U.S. I'm also pleased to report that we've signed an agreement with CVS Health to retain Omnicare's long-term care and Specialty distribution business. We are proud of the exceptional value and service we provide to both CVS Health and Omnicare, and the great relationship we have enjoyed with both companies over many, many years. We are privileged to continue to serve them going forward. And I would note that Health Mart is now more than 4,200 members strong, an increase of over 300 stores in the first six months of this fiscal year. This is a tremendous result. And I'm confident in the strength and scale of our value proposition for our customers and our manufacturing partners. And I believe that we remain extremely well positioned. Turning now to McKesson Specialty Health. We continue to deliver excellent revenue growth in our Specialty business driven by the strong performance across our community Oncology business, the strength in our multi-specialty categories, and the strength of our U.S. Oncology network practices. In the second quarter we saw the first biosimilar launch in the U.S., the biosimilar for Neupogen. We anticipated an increasing number of biosimilar launches in the years to come and we are confident that we are very well positioned given our multi-channel presence, particularly our strength in the community clinic setting and our comprehensive service offering to be a partner of choice for our customers and manufacturers. And our Canadian business got another quarter of solid revenue growth driven by great performance in our core distribution business, and the expansion of our independent pharmacy banner business along with outstanding growth in our Canadian Specialty business compared to the prior year. Turning now to our results in International Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services. Revenues for the second quarter were $5.9 billion, up 2% year-over-year in constant currency. And Celesio's operating performance was slightly ahead of our expectations for the first half of fiscal 2016. We're excited about the acquisition of pharmacy operations of Sainsbury's which will add 281 pharmacies to our leading Lloyds pharmacy brand in the United Kingdom. And we also announced the acquisition of the pharmaceutical distribution business of the United Drug Group, which provides us a strong platform for growth in the Irish market. These acquisitions complement the excellent position of Celesio businesses in the European market and further enhance McKesson's and Celesio's global value proposition to our customers and manufacturing partners. We remain encouraged by the steady improvement we are seeing in the operating results of Celesio as we continue to make important investments in modernizing the IT infrastructure of the business, which will provide a foundation for further operating improvements going forward. And finally, our Medical-Surgical business performed well in the quarter with revenue of $1.6 billion, an increase of 3% over the prior year. I am really pleased with the growth we are driving across Medical-Surgical with a special focus on our Primary Care business which includes physician offices, clinics, surgery centers, and health systems. And although primary care was, as anticipated, the most complex part of the integration work, we've made tremendous progress with the PSS integration through the retention of our world class sales force, the alignment of our technology, and the optimization of our distribution network, all without missing a beat in serving our customers. We also have done a terrific job of creating value with our McKesson brand products. I spend a fair amount of time speaking about global sourcing as it relates to our pharmaceutical business, but it's also important to highlight the global sourcing strength of McKesson in our Medical-Surgical business where we've built exceptional expertise and capabilities over the last decade. It's clear to me that we are emerging from the effort of the PSS integration not only as a more scaled business but also as a partner that can deliver best in class customer service and selection in this industry. In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of our Distribution Solutions segment in the second quarter. We now expect Distribution Solutions' revenue to grow at mid-single digits compared to the prior year, which includes the expiration of our contract with Optum at the start of the third quarter. And we now expect that the full-year adjusted operating margin in Distribution Solutions will be up low-double digits compared to the prior year, reflecting the gain on the sale of ZEE Medical and the expiration of the Optum contract. This is partially offset by generic pharmaceutical pricing trends that we expect will remain weak in the second half of our fiscal year and similar to the level we experienced in our second quarter. Turning now to Technology Solutions, revenues were down 6% for the second quarter to $721 million, driven primarily by the sale of our nurse triage business in the first quarter and an anticipated revenue decline in our hospital software business. Adjusted operating margin in the segment was approximately 22%, which was driven by strong performance in our payer solutions and relay connectivity business and favorable timing in our Medical Imaging business. We expect to achieve a full-year adjusted operating margin for the segment at the upper end of the high teens, which includes the gain we recorded in the first quarter from the sale of our nurse triage business. Now to wrap up my comments. McKesson's fiscal second quarter results represent solid execution across both segments. We are updating our full-year guidance and now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.50 to $13 for fiscal 2016, an increase of $0.14 compared to the guidance we provided in July. Our full-year guidance includes the positive impact of three items: a net gain of $0.11 for the full year in the sale of ZEE Medical; a revised full-year tax rate of 31% compared to our previous assumption of 31.5%, primarily driven by the favorable discrete item recognized in the second quarter; and the full-year impact of a $500 million share repurchase completed late in the second quarter. Now these positive items are partially offset by the expiration of our contract with Optum at the start of the third quarter, our view that generic pharmaceutical pricing trends will remain weak in the second half of the fiscal year but at similar levels to what we experienced in our second quarter. And as you know, our prior guidance did not contemplate a change to our sourcing or distribution agreement with Omnicare. We are very pleased that we have since reached an agreement to retain the distribution portion of that relationship with Omnicare and CVS Health and are updating our guidance to reflect this revised agreement. For the second quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $1.3 billion, and our expectation to deliver cash flow from operations of approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2016 remains unchanged from our original guidance. The Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of $2 billion and we are extremely well positioned to continue to execute our portfolio approach to capital deployment and deliver value for our shareholders from a mix of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases, and dividends. With that, I'll turn the call over to James and will return to address your questions when he finishes. James?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our second quarter results and our performance in the first half of fiscal 2016. As John discussed earlier, we are raising our previous outlook for fiscal 2016 and now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.50 to $13. This revised outlook is driven by the following five items. First, a pre-tax gain of $51 million or $0.14 per diluted share from the sale of the ZEE Medical business, which is reflected in both our GAAP and adjusted earnings for the second quarter. The benefit to our full-year adjusted earnings from this divestiture is $0.11, which is net of the $0.03 in adjusted operating profit that we no longer expect to earn from the ZEE business during fiscal 2016. Second, a discrete tax benefit of approximately $25 million related to a U.S. Tax Court ruling during the second quarter which allowed us to revisit a previous tax filing position. Third, the reduction in our expected weighted average shares outstanding for fiscal 2016 from repurchasing $500 million in common stock late in the second quarter. Our updated diluted weighted average shares outstanding assumption for the fiscal year is now 234 million. Fourth, our view that generic pharmaceutical pricing trends will remain weak in the second half of the fiscal year but at a similar level to what we experienced in the second quarter. And fifth, the impact of certain customer contracting decisions since our previous earnings call in late July, including the expiration of our contract with Optum and our new relationship with CVS Omnicare. Before reviewing our second quarter results, I would like to highlight an update to the schedule accompanying our earnings press release. We have expanded Schedule 3 to include supplemental constant currency information to outline both the dollar and percentage impact of currency movements on our reported results. This supplemental information provides a framework to assess how our business performed excluding the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations. I hope you all find this to be a valuable addition to our ongoing disclosures given the now global nature of our business. During the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2016, our reported adjusted earnings per diluted share included currency headwinds of approximately $0.03 and $0.08 respectively year-over-year. Therefore, during my prepared remarks, I will reference both the reported and constant currency figures which are provided in Schedule 3. Now let's move to our results for the second quarter. My remarks today will focus on our second quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $3.31, which excludes three items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, and LIFO-related adjustments. Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedules 2 and 3, consolidated revenues increased 10% for the quarter to $48.8 billion. Revenues were negatively impacted by $1.4 billion as a result of foreign currency rate movements. On a constant currency basis, revenues were $50.2 billion, an increase of 14%, led by strong growth in our Distribution Solutions segment. Adjusted gross profit for the quarter decreased by 1% to $2.9 billion. On a constant currency basis, adjusted gross profit increased 4%, driven by the performance of Distribution Solutions. Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.8 billion were down 7% for the quarter on a reported basis and down 1% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the gain on the sale of ZEE Medical, which was recorded in the Distribution Solutions operating expense line, total company operating expenses were up 1% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted other income was $17 million for the quarter. Interest expense of $91 million decreased 4% on a reported basis and 2% in constant currency. Now moving to taxes, during the second quarter the previously discussed discrete tax benefit of $25 million drove a reduction in our adjusted tax rate to 29.1%. For the full year, we now expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 31%. As a reminder, our full-year adjusted tax rate reflects our expected mix of domestic and foreign income and anticipated discrete tax items. Adjusted income for the quarter was $776 million with our adjusted earnings per diluted share at $3.31, up 19% on a reported basis and up 20% in constant currency. As I mentioned earlier, the year-over-year currency headwind to Q2 adjusted earnings equated to approximately $0.03 per share. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares were flat year-over-year at 235 million. As mentioned earlier in the second quarter, we executed a share repurchase of common stock totaling $500 million which exhausted the previously granted board authorization. As a result, we now expect our weighted average diluted shares outstanding will be $234 million (sic) [234 million] for the fiscal year. And our board has recently approved a new share repurchase authorization of $2 billion. While we continue to plan for and repay significant debt maturities in fiscal 2016, our recently announced acquisitions, increased dividend, executed share repurchase, and new share repurchase authorization are consistent with our portfolio approach to capital deployment which we have implemented for several years. Now let's turn to the segment results which can be found on Schedules 3A and 3B Distribution Solutions segment revenues of $48 billion were up 11% on a reported basis. Revenues were negatively impacted by $1.4 billion as a result of foreign currency rate movements. Constant currency revenues were $49.4 billion for the second quarter, reflecting growth of 14%. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $40.6 billion in the second quarter, up 16% on a reported basis and 17% on a constant currency basis primarily reflecting market growth in our U.S. pharmaceutical, U.S. Specialty, and Canadian businesses. Demand, primarily from our largest customers, which includes a growing mix of Specialty pharmaceuticals, drove strong revenue growth but also a corresponding impact on our margin profile during the quarter. In addition, this quarter's revenue also benefited from the timing of certain branded drug price increases, which came earlier in the fiscal year than we had originally anticipated. For the full year, we continue to expect North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues to increase by a low double digit percentage. However, it is important to note that this revenue forecast now includes expiration of our contract with Optum at the start of our third fiscal quarter. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $5.9 billion for the second quarter. International revenues were impacted by approximately $1 billion in unfavorable currency rate movements, primarily attributable to a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar when compared to the prior year. Adjusting for this currency impact, revenues were approximately $6.8 billion in the second quarter, up 2% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by market growth. Medical-Surgical revenues were up 3% for the quarter, primarily driven by market growth offset by the sale of ZEE Medical. For the full year, we now expect medical surgical revenues to increase by a low to mid-single digit percentage versus the prior year as a result of the sale of the ZEE Medical business. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit of $2.6 billion decreased 1% on a reported basis and increased 4% on a constant currency basis to $2.7 billion. Adjusted gross profit was impacted by growth in demand from our largest customers and weaker generic pricing trends compared to the prior year, offset by the timing benefit of certain brand price increases. Adjusted operating expense for the segment decreased 8% for the quarter on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, segment operating expense decreased 1% year-over-year. Excluding the gain on the sale of ZEE Medical, adjusted operating expenses increased 3% on a constant currency basis for the quarter. Segment adjusted operating profit of $1.1 billion increased 8% on a reported basis and 11% on a constant currency basis. The segment adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 239 basis points, a decline of 5 basis points year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, the segment margin declined 7 basis points. Excluding the gain on the sale of ZEE Medical, the segment adjusted operating margin decreased 17 basis points on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. The decline in year-over-year segment adjusted operating margin was driven by our business mix and weaker than expected generic pricing trends relative to the prior year, offset by the favorable timing of certain branded drug price increases. As a reminder, for the full year, our expectations for branded drug price inflation remain unchanged, although we do expect some variability in the impact of branded pharmaceutical prices from quarter to quarter. Based on the net gain on the sale of ZEE Medical and the expiration of the Optum contract at the start of the third quarter, offset by our business mix and weaker pricing trends on generic pharmaceuticals, we now expect the Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating margin to expand by low double-digit basis points versus the prior year. Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were down 6% for the quarter to $721 million. This decline was primarily driven by the sale of our Nurse Triage business in the first quarter and anticipated revenue softness of the Horizon Clinical software platform, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses. During the quarter, adjusted operating expenses in the segment decreased 7% on a reported basis and 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by our ongoing expense management efforts. Second quarter adjusted operating profit for the segment increased 13% to $157 million. And the adjusted operating margin rate was approximately 22% representing an increase of 373 basis points versus the prior year. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit increased 9%, representing an adjusted operating margin increase of 281 basis points versus the prior year. This increase was driven by strong performance in our Payer Solutions and Relay Connectivity businesses, along with the benefit of favorable timing in our Medical Imaging business. For the full year, we expect the adjusted operating margin for the segment to be at the upper end of the high teens, which includes the gain we recorded in the first quarter from the sale of our Nurse Triage business. Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding were flat at 26 days. Our days sales in inventories increased by one day to 31 days. Our day sales in payables increased by five days to 53 days. We generated $1.3 billion in cash flow from operations for the quarter. And for the full year we continue to expect our cash flow from operations to be approximately $3 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $5.4 billion, with $2.2 billion held offshore. Internal capital spending was $274 million for the quarter, and we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares totaling $500 million while repaying approximately $500 million in long-term debt. Now I'll turn to our adjusted EPS outlook for the year. As I mentioned earlier, we are raising our fiscal 2016 guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share from our previous range of $12.36 to $12.86 to a new range of $12.50 to $13, an increase of $0.14. As John mentioned in his remarks, our full-year guidance includes the positive impact of three items: A net gain of $0.11 for the full year on the sale of our ZEE Medical business; a revised full year tax rate of 31% compared to our previous assumption of 31.5%, primarily driven by the favorable discrete item recognized in the second quarter; and the full-year impact of a $500 million share repurchase completed late in the second quarter. These positive items are partially offset by the expiration of our contract with Optum at the start of the third quarter, our view that generic pharmaceutical pricing trends will remain weak in the second half of the fiscal year, but at a similar level to what we experienced in the second quarter. And as John just mentioned, our prior guidance did not contemplate the change to our sourcing or distribution agreement with Omnicare. We are very pleased that we have since reached an agreement to retain the distribution portion of that relationship with CVS Omnicare, and our updated guidance reflects our revised agreement. Our outlook assumes a full-year average exchange rate of $1.10 per euro which is unchanged from our prior guidance. In addition, we now expect $1.25 per share in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and $0.33 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. We also expect between $0.89 and $0.99 per share in LIFO related adjustments. In summary, McKesson delivered solid financial results during the first half of fiscal 2016, and we are confident in our outlook for the fiscal year. Thank you, and with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Audra?
Operator: Thank you. . We'll go first to Lisa Gill at JPMorgan.
Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much, and good morning, everyone. Thank you, John for all the detail. I was wondering maybe if we could just start with Europe and Celesio. The last two acquisitions you've made have been in Europe. Can you maybe just give us an update on how you view the European market? What are some of the opportunities? And, you know, how has it played out over the last year and a half versus your expectations when you bought Celesio?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Lisa, for the question. Clearly we went into Europe with our eyes wide open on two fundamental things. One was that Celesio wasn't operating at the level we thought it could and should, and certainly under McKesson's ownership. And second was that the European market does have some risk related to the demand profile as well as the regulations and reimbursement structures that exist there. Having said all of that and knowing where we are headed, we're really pleased with the quality of the results thus far. We believe there's significant opportunities for us to grow both organically in that business by penetrating the areas of the market that have yet to be touched by wholesale distribution, and certainly not touched by us. Like Specialty or Oncology or Hospital distribution. And clearly we think there's a great opportunity for us to deploy capital effectively, efficiently, and appropriately in Europe to help build our value proposition in that market. And also, as you know, we brought with us a very large retail footprint which grows through the acquisition of Sainsbury's and it is growing also just organically in Europe as we complete our banner rollouts with our European pharmacy network, et cetera. So all said, I think we feel like we're in really good shape. We have a couple more years of building out our technology capabilities there. We're in the midst of installing SAP and we have some other work to do, but we do believe that we'll get into business position to not only invest in it the way we have started to, but also to get organic growth.
Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: John, does the company have a goal for how much of operating profit or revenue of the company will come from outside of North America, say over the next several years? And I know I'm not allowed three questions, but I just need a clarification on the comments out of Celesio that you cleared the transfer agreement. Does that mean that you're de-listing the stock? And then I'll stop there.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, certainly on the first part of that question, Lisa, we do have an expectation to grow in all of our businesses, and to grow at rates that are at or above market levels, particularly in markets where we are under-penetrated and there's significant opportunity for us. And that would be the case in Europe. We think there's significant growth prospects for us in most of the markets in which we compete. And as I mentioned, I think this idea of continuing to bring a banner Health Mart-like approach to Europe has been successful and is continuing to show great promise. So you'll see us roll out more Lloyds or Lloyds-like pharmacies throughout Europe. And James, perhaps you can talk a little bit about the...
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. In terms of the Celesio stock, when we gained operating control of Celesio, Celesio was trading on five German exchanges, and we have since then de-listed from three of the five. And on the remaining two, we're still a part of the regulated unofficial market. Those markets are Munich and Dusseldorf. I can't comment on any future plans around de-listing. There are a variety of German legal requirements for us to adhere to, but that's an update on our progress.
Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: We'll move next to Steven Valiquette at UBS Financial.
Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC: All right, thanks. Good morning, John and James. Congrats on the results. So I guess, John, in your prepared comments, you reinforced the notion that there's a lot of change going on in the U.S. pharmaceutical supply channel marketplace. And I guess in light of that, do you think we've reached an era now in the U.S. where large drug distributors could potentially own and operate fairly large retail drug chains in the U.S., similar to what McKesson and others are already doing in Europe? Is this something that you think you could consider now, just given all the U.S. alliances that have already been formed?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, thank you, Steven, for the question. And obviously in Europe the construct of the industry is a little bit different in several of the markets where the wholesalers and retailers are part of the same organization. And in most of those cases, it's the same for all the industry participants, that they are both in the retail business as well as in the wholesaling business. We've looked at that phenomenon for a long time in Europe and wondered if it made sense in a U.S. context. I can tell you that we continue to believe that our customers appreciate the fact that we bring to them a focus on their success and that focus is not hampered by our own interest in a business similar to theirs or competing with them. And so I think that there's still, at least at McKesson, a focus on not competing with our customers in these segments and helping them be more successful each and every day.
Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Can I sneak in just a quick one on the Omnicare? Just for the generic, I'm guessing the sourcing will probably go through Red Oak, but are you saying that you'll still do just the physical distribution of the generics for Omnicare? Or is your distribution retention just on the brand side? Just want to clarify that piece. Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, you might recall that when we started the relationship with Omnicare many years ago, they relied on us for their brand distribution and purchased their generics directly themselves and put it into their own warehousing infrastructure. With our more recent agreement that we worked through with them, you know, we took on the rest of that responsibility, which I think was extremely beneficial to Omnicare. The new structure of the ongoing relationship with CVS will take us back in the direction where our original agreement was with Omnicare, principally focused on the brand side. Now having said that, almost with all of our customers, there is some generic business that we do, principally when there's a shortfall from a centralized warehouse approach or a direct approach. But we'll go back to more of our old relationship. And we're really pleased to be able to do that and to continue to service these Omnicare sites.
Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC: Okay, got it. Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yep.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser at Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, hi, good morning, and congratulations for the Omnicare contract. Two questions here. The first of all, is there an impact of the deals – you're going back to kind of like the old Omnicare generics, some uncertainty around other deals. Does losing kind of like generic business from these kind of like assets that now have been acquired has any impact on your generic purchasing power as it relates for the rest of your business?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Ricky, for the question. Clearly we have had a long run of building significant scale in generic sourcing. And what's interesting about the model that we've built is our customers are choosing to rely on our ability to continue to grow scale and to negotiate favorable agreements and then use us and our assets and our service delivery model to fulfill their needs. We continue to grow our presence quite significantly from a sourcing perspective. You heard me mention a little bit about it when I talked to our continued growth in Health Mart and our new arrangement with Albertsons. And we have over 20,000 pharmacies now that are principally buying all of their generics from McKesson. And so that bulk of business is quite significant and quite attractive to get access to our channel by the generic manufacturers. So, one could argue whether we're number one, number two, number three at any one point in time in any specific market in terms of our generic sourcing. But I believe we have significant scale and are retaining and growing that scale in a way that will be attractive and will bring manufacturers to us in a positive, collaborative way where we can get real value for our customers and for the manufacturers
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then the follow-up is around the branded side. I mean, in the prepared remark obviously you talked about the fact that your assumptions regarding branding inflation are unchanged. There is some uncertainty in the marketplace around inflation, especially given the election debate that's shaping out. How should we think about McKesson's exposure to branded inflation overall and especially when we think about the March quarter, right, being usually a quarter with more inflation than the rest of the year?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, in our prepared comments we talked about the fact that we believe the first half of the year was slightly stronger from a branded inflation perspective. But for the full year, we expected it to be in line with our expectations. And that is still our point of view. Now, clearly there is more media attention and there is more discussion about price inflation in the market. But I happen to believe that the manufacturers that we work with at least will largely retain their current strategy. And there may be some outliers that begin to change their perspective slightly, but overall I think we expect the trends to continue.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yep.
Operator: We'll go next to Robert Jones at Goldman Sachs.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks for the questions. John, I actually just wanted to go back to the comments around Europe and Celesio specifically. I know in the prepared remarks you said Celesio has been exceeding your operational expectations, but I'm curious if you could give us an update on the synergy progression there, maybe relative to some of the targets you guys had shared previously. And I guess specifically, just how the generic purchasing benefits are going and if they're flowing through the combined entity today.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think we've made very good progress. As you know, we established our global sourcing and procurement operations in London, and we have suggested to you in the past that the synergies of $2.75 to $3.25 would be more first half-loaded over a four-year period. So we are in that cycle now and I think we're making very good progress and are on track to accomplish our objectives. So once again, I think the manufacturing community has responded favorably to our global footprint and believe being a strong partner with McKesson will help them grow their business. And that's really the value proposition that we're putting forth and are delivering is that it's a win-win for people that are working closely with us in this collaborative way. So making good progress. And the comments I made earlier about Celesio was more on an operating perspective, that we're beginning to stabilize the operations of the business, put the systems in place and the culture in place along with building on the great management team that is already present. In fact, I was recently both in Italy and in the UK meeting with the management teams there, and there's some exciting things going on and I think the team is really energized about the opportunity of being part of McKesson in the first instance, but also the fact that investment is flowing both in terms of internal investment in warehouses and strategy and in IT systems and infrastructure but also in terms of bringing acquisitions to the table that make sense to grow our business and to grow our platform. So I think that the perspective is quite positive. Now, having said all of that, it's a while before this thing is going to grow the way you know we can grow it. It just takes us some time to put the foundation in place.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: No. I appreciate all that. And then I guess just one more specific one, James. If I go back to the change in guidance, if I maybe exclude the ZEE Medical and the tax benefit, trying to just get my head around the $0.11 reduction. It looks like buybacks added maybe around $0.10. Could you maybe just walk through the other moving pieces, specifically around the contract decisions you mentioned and then the change in generic inflation assumptions?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, well, as we laid out a little bit during the prepared remarks, we have the ZEE gain for $0.11, the updates to our full year tax drives around $0.06, the share repurchase, the $500 million activity that we went into in Q2 drives around $0.09. So when you offset that against the loss of the Optum contract, and we've also talked about the fact that our guide now for the full year includes the new relationship with CVS Omnicare and our expectations for generic price increases, that really fills out the various drivers.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, I'm sorry. Just a clarification then. So did the generic assumption change, and that's part of the change in guidance?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, what's important to remember is when we were last talking to you and talking about the guide, we did not have any change for the back half of the year to how we had been thinking about generic pricing right at the start of the year. So what we're doing now is updating the back half of the year from a generic pricing perspective, and we're saying that you would see a similar level of weakness there in line to what we saw in Q2.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Bob Willoughby of Bank of America.
Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch: Just a quick one. You'd mentioned in an earlier call that some of the assets in Brazil for Celesio were for sale. Is there an update on that?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, you're right. We did mention that. And the business has been I think working with potential buyers to portray the high quality assets that we have there, and I think we're still in a process with several interested parties. So I'm hopeful that we'll get that concluded within this fiscal year, if not in the third quarter. So we're making progress and we'll keep you updated as that goes. But yes, that is exactly what we said and we plan to continue with that plan.
Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch: Is there any way to size that, John? Is it bigger than a bread box? Is there a gain or a loss associated with it? Do you expect to associate with it?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, all I'd say is remember that this is part of our discontinued operations now.
Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch: Right.
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So it wouldn't impact – the end result won't impact our adjusted EPS.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: And I would say that it's on the small side as bread boxes go. I wouldn't fret about it too much.
Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Garen Sarafian at Citi Research.
Garen Sarafian - Citi Investment Research: Good morning, John. Good morning, James. First on Omnicare, I appreciate the further clarification you made earlier in the Q&A, but I'm curious around the dynamics leading to this result. I would have thought that from a client perspective, all else equal, they'd want to keep both sides of the distribution with a single vendor. And from the distributor side, I thought that branded alone was fairly standardized low margin offering and pretty much a commodity. So I'm just wondering if there's anything unique that you were able to provide or any other unique dynamic that you can offer to help think through this.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, it's difficult for me to make blanket statements about what every customer chooses to do. I would say that our current relationship with CVS on the retail side of their business is principally the distribution of branded pharmaceuticals, and their strategy around generics is actually to ship those products directly from their own CVS warehouses and not to order them through distribution. So albeit I can't speak necessarily to what they ultimately will do with all of the Omnicare business, but usually the decision that large customers make is either to put all the generics and all of the brand into the single wholesaler that they've selected to partner with, at least for that store or that business line. Or to bifurcate the two of them and purchase the generics on a direct basis, put them into their own warehouse, manage their own logistics, and ship them to the stores. You might recall when we had the discussion related to Rite Aid last year when they made a decision to get out of the generic business. What they were doing was not moving Rite Aid's generic volume from another wholesaler to McKesson. They were actually moving their generic volume out of their own infrastructure and into McKesson's infrastructure. So I would say that my belief is that CVS is still a self-warehousing customer on generics, and I would imagine that at least there's a strong possibility that what they'll do is move the Omnicare model back to the model that's frequently used within the rest of CVS. So I don't believe there'll be two distributors at Omnicare. I think there'll be a McKesson relationship on brand and perhaps some generic fill-in, and the rest of it will come out of CVS on a centralized, coordinated basis like they do for the rest of their operation.
Garen Sarafian - Citi Investment Research: Got it, okay. That's helpful. And then just moving to Tech Solutions. Your margins were clearly strong leading to the revision to the high end of guidance. But in the prepared remarks, out of the three reasons behind the strength, two of the three were arguably sustainable. So could you just elaborate on how you're thinking about the margin profile of this segment moving forward? I'm just trying to get an idea of why this wouldn't continue its trajectory, at least on the margin front.
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, what we have said in the prepared remarks is that we would expect the full-year guide for Technology Solutions' operating margin to be at the upper end of the high teens. So recall that when we gave you original guidance at the start of the fiscal year, we were expecting to be around the low end of the high teens. Now, the primary delta there is the care management gain that we recorded in the first quarter. Now, peeling back from that, we continue to be pleased with the growth we're seeing in our payer provider businesses and the relay connectivity businesses. But of course the growth there is having to be offset by our decision to exit the Horizon Hospital software business. So that will have an impact on technology solutions.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: But obviously to reinforce what you're saying, we're pleased with the margin trajectory of that business and we're pleased with the progress we've made in taking as much cost out as we can as we take that Horizon business down over the next couple of years.
Operator: We'll go next to Eric Coldwell at Baird.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey. Thanks very much. John, I think I generally agree with your views on branded inflation and clearly brand inflation is not as important as it was more than a decade ago under the old industry structure. But I would love it if you could give us a little more detail on sort of the current state of contracts, maybe the percent of sales that are not under fee for service relationships. And then under fee for service, suspending disbelief, if branded price inflation did pare back, what would happen with the model? How would you adjust? What kind of impact might we see? And I'll leave it at that. Thanks so much.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, thanks for the question. Clearly as you mentioned, if you go back in history, there have been lots of different models that McKesson has used to create relationships with manufacturers that are beneficial to them and beneficial to ourselves and certainly onward to our customers. And over time we have created relationships with the manufacturers that have been less dependent on price inflation, providing more visibility to the manufacturers on our supply chain and working in partnership with them to give them the data and the things that they might find useful to them in their own production activities and their go-to-market strategies. And in return, they've gone and paid us for that work in these fee for service or distribution relationships contracts that they've have signed. That has frankly taken some of the top off the opportunity on price inflation and taken some of the bottom off on price inflation risk, so the band of performance is probably certainly a little more forecastable. And we've also talked in the past that roughly 80% plus or minus of our business are in structured arrangements that are fee for service type of dialogue or certainly more constructed and documented than the rest of the balance. So that also has helped reduce some of the volatility you might find in this particular lever of profitability inside of our P&L.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): With the – you talk about the 80%, and I think that is a pretty consistent message. Is the 20% – is a certain percentage of that your Specialty business, or are you talking core traditional brand at retail when you give the 80% figure?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, it's really sort of across the board. And I think another response I could give to you and your associates, when you think about inflation risk for McKesson, there are lots of levers we use in our business to drive our performance. And when we try to give you these high level themes, it's because they are important themes, and we talk about them at the annual guidance point. We give you our assumptions because they are drivers of our value. But clearly as you go through the year, there are a lot of things that aren't quite as you expected at the beginning of the year, and if they're part of these larger forces, we'll update you as the year goes on. And James spent some time talking about generic inflation and its relative position against our expectations when we started the year. But there are also lots of other drivers in our business that are going both positive and in negative throughout the year, and I can assure you that the company remains extremely focused on driving our performance as we have over the last 15 years, and we use these other vehicles to offset risk that might be apparent to us in our business as those risks materialize. So, do we have risk on inflation? Clearly we talked about generics today, and we talked about our views of brand inflation. But it's also our responsibility to not only tell you about these things but manage these risks on a proactive basis and be assertive and on top of it. And if there was some fundamental sea change in our industry relative to our views of where these metrics might go over time, then we would begin to reformat our relationship with our customers and our supplier partners and we'd find ways to continue to grow our business. And so I think that that level of confidence is what you should be getting from us today.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks very much
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yep.
Operator: We'll go in next to George Hill at Deutsche Bank.
George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, good morning guys, and thanks for taking the question. John, appreciate all the comments around kind of the Rite Aid announcement. I guess, but the company seems a little bit snake-bit by industry M&A lately. I guess either John or James, can you guys quantify the risk around the Rite Aid relationship? And John, I would ask as you think about industry consolidation strategically, do you feel like the company needs to be more aggressive than it has been historically and does it change the risk profile at all for how you think about acquisitions?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, thanks for the question here. Clearly we've had a longstanding relationship with Rite Aid and we'll do everything we can to help them in this transition. And we have a great deal of respect for Mr. Pessina and his team at Walgreens and the kind of value they've delivered over a long time. And we've been working with Walgreens for 20 years, and I know Stefano for over 18 years, having traveled back and forth to Europe before he got to the scale that they are today. And so, these working relationships usually help us as we work through transitions in our industry, and we're really proud of the fact that our longstanding relationship with CVS both on the mail side as well as the store side at least came into play when we had the dialogue regarding Omnicare. So are we sometimes on the wrong end of these transactions? Absolutely. But as to the second part of your question, it doesn't mean we're going to deploy capital in a reckless way. We've got a long track record of building value through a portfolio approach and we'll continue to do that. We're not oblivious to the risk that exists as our market consolidates both on the supplier and the customer side. And clearly sometimes we're with the consolidators and sometimes we're not. And when we're not, we have to find a way to either create a relationship or build on an existing relationship or find another avenue to grow our business, which is our ultimate objective. And we have chosen thus far, and we believe this is the right path, to not compete with our customers. So I don't think we'll begin acquiring providers in an effort to offset the risk of provider consolidation in our book of business to deal with it. What we'll continue to do is focus on the value we can deliver for our partners. And as that value creation opportunity expands, then hopefully even through acquisitions, people will find that McKesson is the partner of choice, and they'll build their relationship with us as opposed to discontinuing it. But you can tell also from our guidance that sometimes when these relationships change, it has a negative effect on our margin structure, and that's really what we're reflecting when we talked about some of the puts and takes in the quarter.
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I'd just add that an example, a very recent example of where we're building with the consolidator is Albertsons Safeway. So it's a mix, a natural ebb and flow of the business cycle.
George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, and I guess maybe then just the quick follow-up would be does industry consolidation maybe from an M&A perspective think about how far just from the core that you look? And I guess how, when I think about McKesson's expertises, it's in procurement, it's in supply chain, it's in logistics, it's in distribution. Do you start to look into tangential spaces in healthcare or are there customer groups that you don't serve now where McKesson's expertise can be leveraged that you see opportunities? Thank you
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks for the question. Clearly our job is to find ways to grow our business and to do it intelligently and to do it in a risk-bounded way and to deploy capital intelligently. So I think our number one priority is to deploy capital in places where we have a base and an expertise and where it's not a completely new leg of the stool, but it's something that's additive to what we're currently doing. So, I think we evaluate everything and clearly every healthcare or almost healthcare distribution opportunity that comes on the market comes through McKesson and many of them we pass on because it's not straight up our alley or we believe that the price is too high. But otherwise, we're going to stay pretty focused.
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, and I'd just add in terms of the breadth of our businesses, whether it's Canada, Europe, Specialty, Medical-Surgical, Technology Solutions, and there are a variety of businesses that we have where there will be opportunities that are down the middle of the fairway.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Exactly. We've just been told there are a few more questions pending so we're going to run this call just a little bit later for those of you that have time to do that. So we'll go on to the next question.
Operator: And we'll move to Charles Rhyee at Cowen.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the question here. John, James, John, I think in your remarks you talked about biosimilars with Neupogen being the first launch. Just curious what you've seen in terms of the uptake in that product and how that might be shaping your views on biosimilars in the future.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, thank you for the question. Clearly biosimilars are going to be an important aspect of our business portfolio going forward and we will continue to, I think, see benefit of these biosimilar launches over the coming years. As to the specific launch that we've recently seen, it frankly has not gotten a ton of traction yet, at least not in our business, and it's behaving much more like a branded product than it is a typical quick-to-substitute generic. At some point these biosimilars probably will be more substitutable because their clinical effectiveness and efficacy will have been proven in some fashion. And that's where we'll have more opportunities to make faster transfers of the product. And we think we're very well positioned, particularly when the product are right down the alley of community oncology and we can use our U.S. oncology network to help validate the efficacy of the product and then move market share very quickly, either keep the market share with the originator or move it to the biosimilar to the extent that they're replaceable. So we will look for opportunities going forward.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: If I could just follow up there, though, right now then would you say the margin profile also looks more like a brand than a generic? And then in terms of substitutability, though, it seems like in the biosimilar pathway that it doesn't have the same type of A-B substitutability that traditional generics do. Do you think that regulations have to change to allow that for distributors to really benefit from that ability to move share? Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, it is behaving more like a brand, and not only in terms of the way it's being taken to market and its pricing structure, but also in the way that the physicians are viewing it. I think they want to have a discussion about the product itself as opposed to accepting an automatic substitution by a pharmacy or by a wholesaler. I do believe, though, over time that substitutability question will become less and less a question and to the extent that we can help people create evidence that supports the A-B interchangeability or therapeutic substitution, then we certainly will pursue that. In the meantime, though, we look at that as a long-term priority, and I wouldn't consider any of the up and coming pending things in the next six months to a year as being blockbuster, big successes for us, at least right out of the gate
Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yep.
Operator: We'll go next to Eric Percher at Barclays.
Eric R Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. I'd like to go back to one of your early comments, John, on consistency. And this may be a question more for James. But I look at the balance sheet and think this is a large lever for you to be able to drive consistency as we look out to the forward years. Particularly today, you mentioned $5.4 billion of cash and $1.7 billion of CFO to come. We saw the revolver put in place. As we look over the balance of the year, I know there was some debt maturity. We've got the international acquisitions. But it feels like there'll still be a pretty substantial capability. So could you walk us through what will be due and maybe what was behind the revolver and where you sit as you look at the remainder of the year?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, we're certainly pleased with the financial flexibility that we have. And I'll start off just by really reminding you of the portfolio approach that we have to capital allocation. And within that portfolio, internal capital expenditures and M&A are the first and second priorities. So certainly want to be clear about that. But given the degree of flexibility that we have, obviously we're also going to look regularly at what we think is a realistic M&A pipeline in the short, medium term. Contrast that against our cash balance and our coming projected free cash flow and make an assessment as to whether there's excess cash available for share repurchases. And you've seen us take that action in terms of buybacks now both in this last Q2 and in the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year. So we're pleased that the board authorized the new $2 billion authorization for share repurchases. So it feels as though we have the liquidity and the right portfolio approach, the right flexibility, to continue to deploy capital effectively on your behalf.
Eric R Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And the change in, or the element that has impacted guidance was the $500 million being done earlier in the year. There's no change. The $2 billion issued is not implied to be used in your current guidance. And I guess it also begs the question when you look to Europe, are there $10 billion deals, or are most of these $2 billion, $3 billion, or much smaller?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, in terms of the weighted average shares outstanding, the full-year number that I mentioned was 234 million. Embedded within that is the $500 million buyback. There is nothing assumed about progress against the new $2 billion authorization. In terms of the transaction sizes available to us, I wouldn't want to really comment on anything specific to M&A. You've seen the recent deal sizes with UDG and Sainsbury's. But there's a wide range of opportunities across the very broad set of businesses that we operate.
Eric R Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Dave Francis at RBC Capital Markets.
Dave K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hi. Thanks, and congratulations on a solid quarter. Just a real quick one, John. Bigger picture, I appreciate the commentary on what you're seeing from pricing trend perspective across both the brand and generic baskets. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing volume-wise in terms of any meaningful change in the marketplace up or down domestically? Is there anything going on in the broad economy that's impacting volume trends as you're seeing them in the U.S. business? Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks for the question, Dave. I think we see things pretty much in line with what we had expected for the year on a volume basis. And clearly you can see that the numbers that are being posted by the various sources as to prescription volumes. I think we don't see any major changes. There are perhaps some changes that you might see in the physician office perspective, but I would say that the biggest change or trend that we continue to see is that some of our larger customers are growing more rapidly than the rest. And in particular, our largest mail customer has had pretty nice growth. And so that puts a little pressure on our margin structure, particularly on the Specialty products that go through that particular customer. But otherwise, everything's pretty much in line with what we'd anticipated.
Dave K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Very good. Thank you.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yep.
Operator: And our next question comes from David Larsen at Leerink.
David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC: Hey, guys. Can you talk about the generic inflation comp? Like, when do you expect that to start to ease? So inflation rates were obviously very high in calendar 2014. They've pulled in over the past couple of quarters. So next year, and just any general thoughts. Would you expect the comp for generic inflation to ease a bit?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, generic inflation is not forecastable and we certainly don't have any insight from what the manufacturers are planning to do in their businesses. We've updated our assumption for the back half of this fiscal year. And of course we really want to take a step back and emphasize how generic price inflation is just one of a number of variables that drive again this broad set of businesses. So I would urge not to have an over focus, if you will. It's an important issue, as John was mentioning earlier. We included in our initial annual guide, and we update you as the year goes along. But I really think we want to keep this in perspective in terms of the broad number of drivers of our businesses.
David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay. Great. And then just any quick thoughts on Target? Have you had any discussions with CVS around Target and that account?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, unless you've heard something different, we've not heard of the Target transaction closing, and I would imagine our conversations with CVS would be more worthwhile post that process than today. So I'm not really prepared to comment or speculate on it other than to say we're continue to service the Target business with all of our focus and we want to make sure those stores are in great shape pre the transition to CVS ownership.
David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.
Operator: We'll take Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: Maybe just not to beat the horse on Rite Aid, but just going back, one of the big questions we've gotten from a lot of investors is just sort of understanding how change of control provisions work on these kind of contracts. Obviously you've dealt with quite a few of them recently. And I guess, secondarily, understanding the sort of pushes and pulls long-term of being a key provider to a large retail chain. Obviously you still have a relationship with CVS and we'll have to see what happens with Rite Aid. But that's on the mail side. How do you think about that? Does it help you at all with the independents? I'm just trying to understand the long-term implications of that as well.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, just to make sure that I'm clear, that – our CVS relationship is with both the mail as well as many of their retail stores and now our continued relationship on Omnicare. As to Walgreens and Rite Aid, we've had a long-term relationship with Walgreens. It just hasn't happened to have had distribution as a key component of it for perhaps a couple of decades. Like anything else we're going to work hard to make sure that those Rite Aid stores are serviced and continue to focus on making our customers successful there. And we'll see where things head over time. But remember, customers kind of come and go in people's business, and albeit we've had a bad run here with two or three M&A transactions that were "not our fault" related to losing customers. But you also should expect that we'll continue to work hard to grow our business. And I talked before about the fact that we have a very large base of people who are dependent on us from a generic perspective. And albeit that base continues to grow. We think no matter what happens from a customer perspective, we will still be one of the largest suppliers of generics in the world and a very valuable partner to the manufacturers.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: Great. Thanks. I'm sorry for the poorly worded question.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No, that's okay. I just said I want to make sure everybody else listening was clear on it, Ross. I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: And we'll take that from John Ransom at Raymond James.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: John?
Operator: Mr. Ransom your line is open. Please go ahead.
John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi. Sorry. Trying to multi-task here and doing it very poorly. I'm sorry if this has been asked, but the Rite Aid contract expires in 2019. Is there a change of control out on the other side? Or do you expect that to remain in place through 2019?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, we don't talk specifically about the terms of our agreements other than what we say at the beginning of them. And I think that the comment I made in answer to the question earlier is we plan to continue to serve their business with all of our effort and make sure that they're very successful as they continue through this transaction process.
John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. That's all I had. Thank you.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: All right. You're welcome.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I want to thank you, Audra. Thanks also for all of you on the call for your time today. Our industry experiences periods of dynamic change, and this is certainly one of them. And I'm confident that we will continue to participate in that change in an extremely positive way. We remain extremely well positioned to deliver the best service and value in the industry on behalf of our customers. And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Erin for her review of upcoming events for the financial community. Erin?
Erin Lampert - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, John. On November 10 we will present at the Credit Suisse Health Conference in Scottsdale Arizona. And on January 12, we will present at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. We'll release our third quarter earnings results in late January. Thank you, and good-bye.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference. Again, thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the McKesson Corporation quarterly earnings call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Erin Lampert - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, Solari. Good afternoon and welcome to the McKesson fiscal 2016 first quarter earnings call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO, and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update and will then introduce James, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After James's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 6:00 PM Eastern Time. Before we begin, I'd remind listeners that during the course of this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current, and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; acquisition expenses and related adjustments; certain claim and litigation reserve adjustments; and LIFO-related adjustments. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for investors. Please refer to our press release announcing first quarter fiscal 2016 results, available on our website, for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Please also note that on today's call, we will refer to certain measures calculated on a constant currency basis. Additional information on constant currency effects is available in our SEC filings. Thank you. And here is John Hammergren.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Erin. And thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Today we reported a solid start to fiscal 2016. For the first quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $47.5 billion, up 13%, and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.14, up 30%, both on a constant currency basis over the prior year. During the first quarter we completed the sale of our Nurse Triage business, a small business within the Technology Solutions segment, and we recorded a gain of $0.16 per diluted share in the quarter. Therefore, we are updating our full-year guidance and now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.36 to $12.86 for fiscal 2016. Turning now to our business results for the quarter, Distribution Solutions revenues were $46.8 billion, up 13% on a constant currency basis. And Distribution Solutions adjusted operating profit was $1.1 billion, up 17% on a constant currency basis. Our North American Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services business, which includes U.S. Pharmaceutical, McKesson Specialty Health, and McKesson Canada, continued to lead the way, with revenue growth in the first quarter up 16% on a constant currency basis. Revenue in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business exceeded our expectations in the first quarter, driven by strong growth from a few of our largest customers and brand pricing trends ahead of our expectations. However, generic pricing trends were well below the level of the prior year and below our expectations for the first quarter. We will continue to monitor pricing trends in the market and will provide updates as we communicate our quarterly results going forward. We continue to grow our business with our U.S. Pharmaceutical customers across the retail, institutional, and independent channels. I'd like to take a moment to highlight our vibrant community of independent pharmacy customers. Last month we hosted our annual conference for retail independent customers, which brought together thousands of community pharmacy owners and pharmacists from across the country, including our growing base of Health Mart pharmacy customers, now representing more than 4,000 stores across the U.S. Record attendance at this year's conference reinforced the growing need for independent pharmacists to understand the dynamics shaping their industry and to evolve their business to meet these new demands. This year's conference centered on our strategy to help customers attract more patients through greater access to preferred networks and highlighted McKesson's suite of services, which enable pharmacies to operate more efficiently and capture new sources of revenue. We've hosted this conference now for almost 40 years, and it continues to provide an exceptional platform for peer networking and continuing education while celebrating innovation, patient commitment, and business growth of our exceptional independent pharmacist partners. In summary, I'm proud of the value we deliver for our U.S. Pharmaceutical customers and the innovative services and solutions that set us apart. As some of you may have heard me say on occasion, it is our standard of operational excellence that earns us the privilege to serve our customers every day. And it's our team's focus on our customers' success that allows us to grow our relationships and create value far beyond the core of Distribution Solutions. Turning now to our McKesson Specialty Health, I'm extremely pleased with the results for the first quarter, which represent a strong start to the fiscal year. Once again, we delivered impressive growth in our specialty business, driven by the performance in the U.S. oncology network and our broader oncology offerings and continued excellent growth in other multi-specialty categories. I believe we are very well positioned to continue to grow and innovate in this dynamic market. And our Canadian business had nice growth in the quarter, with results that were in line with our expectations. At our Investor Day last month, we highlighted the great achievements of our Canadian business. I'm now pleased to tell you that our team continues to grow, not only our core distribution business, but also expanding into our specialty and retail banner presence in the market. The recent addition of the Remedy'sRx banner in Canada adds to the scale we have built to support independent pharmacy. I'm proud to say that roughly 40% of all independent pharmacies in Canada operate under one of our banners, and we leverage our innovative services, products and technology to drive better results for our business and our customers. Turning now to our results for international Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services, revenues for the first quarter were $5.8 billion, roughly flat year over year on a constant currency basis. And operating performance from Celesio was ahead of our expectations in the quarter. Earlier today, Celesio announced the acquisition of the pharmacy operations of Sainsbury's, a leading chain of supermarkets in the United Kingdom. Under the terms of the agreement, Celesio will acquire 277 in-store pharmacies and four hospital-based pharmacies, which will now be operated and branded as LloydsPharmacy. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2016 and will broaden the already strong footprint of LloydsPharmacy in the United Kingdom and add scale to the more than 12,000 owned or banner pharmacies across McKesson. In summary, we're off to a positive start to the year and I'm encouraged by the momentum in our international Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services business. And finally, our Medical-Surgical business performed well in the quarter, with revenues of $1.4 billion, an increase of 4% over the prior year, including strong growth in our physician office business. Our McKesson surgical team continues to do an excellent job as we enter the home stretch of the integration activities driven by the PSS World Medical acquisition. We expect to complete our planned integration efforts by the end of fiscal 2016, on schedule and ahead of our original business case. And while our Medical-Surgical team is still in the midst of a tremendous amount of work, I'd like to recognize the outstanding progress they've made to-date and their success in driving better value for our customers. In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of Distribution Solutions in the first quarter. We now expect Distribution Solutions revenue growth of high-single digits compared to the prior year. And we now expect that full-year adjusted operating margin in Distribution Solutions will be up in the mid-single digits compared to the prior year. Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were down 4% for the first quarter to $736 million, driven primarily by anticipated revenue decline in our hospital software business and the sale of our nurse triage business. Adjusted operating margin in the segment was 22.7%, which includes a $51 million pre-tax gain associated with the sale of the nurse triage business. Excluding this gain, adjusted operating margin would have been 15.8%. Our first quarter results benefited from the steady growth profile of our Financial and Clinical Data and Services businesses, which include RelayHealth and our physician revenue cycle business, along with positive results in our payer solutions business. We continue to make steady progress across Technology Solutions, and I remain confident in our outlook for the full year, which includes an expectation for achieving adjusted operating margin in the high teens from the segment. Now to wrap up my comments. McKesson's fiscal first quarter results represent solid execution across both segments. We are updating our full-year outlook for fiscal 2016 to a range of $12.36 to $12.86 to reflect the gain on the sale of our nurse triage business. For the first quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $454 million. And our expectation to deliver cash flow from operations of approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2016 remains unchanged from our original guidance. Earlier today the Board of Directors approved an increase to the quarterly dividend from $0.24 to $0.28 per share. We are extremely well positioned to execute our portfolio approach to capital deployment and deliver value for our shareholders through a mixture of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. With that, I'll turn the call over to James, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, John. And good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our first quarter results, which represent a solid start to fiscal 2016. As John discussed earlier, we are raising our previous outlook and now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.36 to $12.86. This revised outlook is a result of the pre-tax gain of $51 million or $0.16 per diluted share from the sale of our nurse triage business, which is reflected in both our GAAP and adjusted earnings for the quarter. We do not expect that the elimination of the nurse triage business' operating results will have a material impact on our expectations for fiscal 2016 adjusted operating profit. Now let's move to our results for the quarter. My remarks today will focus on our first quarter adjusted EPS of $3.14, which excludes three items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, and LIFO-related adjustments. Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedule 2 and Schedule 3, consolidated revenues increased 9% for the quarter to $47.5 billion. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 13%, led by strong growth in our Distribution Solutions segment. Adjusted gross profit for the quarter increased 4% to $2.9 billion. On a constant currency basis, adjusted gross profit increased 9%, driven by the performance in both segments. Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.8 billion were down 5% for a quarter on a reported basis and up 1% on a constant currency basis. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, operating expenses are presented net of the $51 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our Nurse Triage business. Excluding this gain, total adjusted operating expenses were up 4% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted other income was $15 million for the quarter. Interest expense of $89 million decreased 7% on a reported basis and 4% on a constant currency basis. Now moving to taxes, our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 31.1%. As usual, I would expect this tax rate to fluctuate somewhat from quarter to quarter. And for the full year, we continue to expect an adjusted tax rate of 31.5%. Adjusted income for the quarter was $737 million, with our adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.14, up 27% on a reported basis and up 30% on a constant currency basis. The year-over-year currency headwind equated to $0.06 per share. Wrapping up our consolidated results, our diluted weighted average shares were flat year over year at 235 million. While we continue to plan for upcoming significant debt maturities, today's announced acquisition and dividend increase are consistent with our portfolio approach to capital deployment, which for some years now has focused on a blend of internal investments, acquisitions, share repurchases, and dividends. Let's now review the segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3. Distribution Solutions segment revenues of $46.8 billion were up 10% on a reported basis and 13% in constant currency during the quarter. North America Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services revenues of $39.5 billion increased 16% on a constant currency basis, primarily reflecting market growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical, U.S. Specialty, and Canadian businesses. Our largest customers drove strong growth, with a corresponding impact on our mix business and margin profile. In addition, this quarter's revenue also benefited from the timing of certain branded drug price increases, which came earlier in the fiscal year than we had originally anticipated. For the full year, we now expect North America Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services revenues to increase by a low double-digit percentage versus the prior year. International Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services revenues were $5.8 billion for the first quarter. On a constant currency basis, revenues were flat relative to the prior year and in line with our expectations. Overall revenue growth, driven by our businesses in the United Kingdom, was mainly offset by an anticipated revenue decline from last year's loss of a Norwegian hospital contract. As a reminder, the results from Celesio's operations in Brazil are reported as part of discontinued operations on Schedule 1 of the tables accompanying our press release. Medical-Surgical revenues were up 4% for the quarter, driven by market growth. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit increased 4% on a reported basis and 10% on a constant currency basis for the quarter. The increase in Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit was driven by the strong revenue growth in our North American Distribution business, the timing of certain brand drug price increases that occurred earlier in the fiscal year than we expected, a benefit from antitrust settlement proceeds that was contemplated in our guidance, and a better than expected performance from Celesio. Offsetting this growth were weaker than expected generic drug pricing trends in the quarter. The level, nature, and timing of generic pricing trends remain difficult to predict. We will continue to monitor market activity and will provide updates to you as we communicate our results each quarter. Adjusted operating expense for the segment decreased 3% for the quarter on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, segment operating expense increased 4% year over year. Segment adjusted operating profit of $1.1 billion increased 14% on a reported basis and 17% on a constant currency basis. The segment adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 242 basis points, an improvement of eight basis points on a constant currency basis versus the prior year, driven by solid growth across the segment, including continued expansion of our generics business, favorable timing of certain branded drug price increases, the anticipated antitrust settlements, and better than expected results from Celesio. This year-over-year segment adjusted operating margin expansion was partially offset by weaker generic pricing trends and our business mix. As I mentioned earlier, we now expect full-year revenue growth from our North America Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services business to increase by a low double-digit percentage versus the prior year, driven in part by higher than expected demand from our largest customers. Based on this growth and the resulting mix of revenue in our North American Distribution business, we now expect segment adjusted operating margin to increase by mid-single-digit basis points year over year. Turning now to Technology Solutions, revenues were down 4% for the quarter to $736 million. This decline was primarily driven by the anticipated revenue softness of the hospital software platform and the sale of our Nurse Triage business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses. As I discussed earlier, our consolidated first quarter gap in adjusted results reflect a pre-tax gain of $51 million from the sale of our Nurse Triage business. This gain was recorded as a reduction to Technology Solutions operating expenses for the first quarter. Adjusted operating expense in the segment decreased 27% and segment adjusted operating profit increased 109%, primarily as a result of this gain. Excluding this gain, segment adjusted margin increased 534 basis points year over year. For the full year, excluding the gain recorded on the sale of our Nurse Triage business, we continue to expect to achieve an adjusted operating margin in the high teens. Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics, as you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding were relatively flat at 26 days. Our days sales in inventory decreased by one day to 30 days. Our days sales in payables increased by three days to 53 days. We generated $454 million in cash flow from operations for the quarter. And for the full year, we continue to expect our cash flow from operations to be approximately $3 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $5.6 billion, with $1.9 billion held offshore. Internal capital spending was $120 million for the quarter. Now I'll turn to our adjusted EPS outlook for the year. As I mentioned earlier we are raising our fiscal 2016 guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share from our original range of $12.20 to $12.70 to a new range of $12.36 to $12.86 to reflect the gain on the sale of our Nurse Triage business. This outlook assumes a full-year average exchange rate of $1.10 per euro, which is unchanged from our prior guidance. In addition, we now expect $1.24 per share in amortization of acquisition-related tangible assets and $0.30 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. We also expect to exclude between $0.86 and $0.96 per share in LIFO-related adjustments, short of our adjusted earnings. While we cannot predict the timing of pharmaceutical pricing activity, our current expectation is that the split of earnings between the first and second half of fiscal 2016 will be in line with our experience in fiscal 2015. Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Solari?
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our first question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, hi. Good afternoon. A couple of questions here. First of all, obviously, generic inflation is a big focus area for investors, so thank you for your comments on that. But can you just help us understand, how should we think about generic inflation trending within the context of your guidance range?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Certainly, as we've mentioned, we did see generic price increase activity below the levels of the last fiscal year and below our original expectations. Now, that said, obviously our guide that we issued a few months back has a variety of variables that are key to it, and we list those out for you. So the width of the range allows us some flexibility to take into account variables of one driver that's up versus another driver down. So we're comfortable with the range that we've articulated this afternoon. That reflects the addition of the care management nurse triage gain. And of course we'll keep everyone updated as we proceed through the fiscal year.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just as a follow up, very strong top-line growth for distribution solutions, up 15% despite some impressive year-over-year comps you're anniversarying. So when you think about the environment and branded inflation that you've seen in the quarter, do you expect similar trends for the remainder of the year? It seems just the growth is stronger than what you guys implied in the Analysts Day.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think we've had good success in growing our business across the board. And I think the interesting part of the base of business that we have in our mix is that we have some customers that are growing we think more rapidly than the market. And that growth is clearly seen in our business. That comes with it better revenue growth, but it does put a little pressure on our mix as a result of the scale of those customers. We're certainly pleased with the performance in the quarter and we expect that revenue momentum to continue throughout the fiscal year.
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And one of the other drivers of the revenue strength in Q1 was the acceleration of some of the branded price increases that occurred in the first quarter that we were originally expecting to occur later in the year. Next question?
Operator: We'll move next to Steven Valiquette with UBS.
Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. Good afternoon. I think we all understand the comments about generic inflation being difficult to predict. There's definitely no question about that. But I guess I'm just curious, with your privilege of daily conversations with generic suppliers, with some 20/20 hindsight now, do you have any thoughts or any opinions on what you think may have just led to that temporary slowdown of generic inflation in the June quarter? Or do you just attribute that to randomness and obviously some tough comps year over year that we saw for the June quarter in particular? Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks for the question, Steve. I think the comps are clearly one of the challenges when we think about the strength of the price increases in the prior year. I think that although we have close working relationships with the generic manufacturers, they don't always share with us their plans related to price increases. Clearly their view of product launches, their merger and acquisition activity, there are lots of things moving around in the market that may also be distracting them from some the things that they may be doing on a short-term basis or could have done on a short-term basis. I think our view is that we believe that generic pricing power will remain a part of the strategy generic companies will employ. And that balanced with the scheduled generic launches, et cetera, are part of the things that drive their P&Ls. I would say following on to what James said earlier, there are lots of variables in the way our quarters flow. And one of the positive things in the quarter was the fact that our brand price inflation work was a little stronger than we'd seen on a compare basis. So there are always puts and takes as you move along. And I think the most important thing is that we continue to find ways to move the business. And we're obviously also very pleased with the performance of our Specialty business and Celesio had a very good quarter. So both Specialty and Celesio performed above what we would have expected, even though our generic price part of our business may have been a little bit behind.
Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC: Okay, all right. That's helpful. Thanks.
Operator: We'll take next Eric Percher with Barclays.
Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. So on the topic of growth at large customers, do you think that growth is coming at the expense of smaller customers? Or is it that the larger customers are getting a greater share of where we do see outsized market growth?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Clearly I think the Specialty business is more inclined to go through the larger customer, particularly in the PBM channel. We obviously have seen some market shifts in PBMs as well. And I would imagine on the edge, our larger customers are taking some incremental share in the market. But I would say that at least the base of independents that McKesson is involved and closely working with, we've seen good strength in that business, both in the growth of Health Mart stores but also in terms of their revenue growth. So I think the most important thing for us to do is to continue to focus on bringing our scale and our capabilities to the smaller customers to help them continue to level the playing field relative to the larger customers. And on the larger customer side, we have to find ways to add more value so that our margin impact isn't as negative as it can be when the mix changes.
Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Even absent the growth at the top line, operating expense seemed to come in quite a bit below where we expected on the Distribution side where you didn't have the impact. Could you speak to some of the activity and how it felt relative to your own expectation?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We are very focused on, as you know, Eric, in being efficient and productive in our operations. I think we have over 3,000 – closer to 6,000 black belts if you include Celesio around the world. And those folks are designed to help us drive efficiency in our operations. I also think it's important for to us maintain discipline around pricing. Albeit the mix thing is hard for to us control, our pricing decisions are within our control and we have to stay disciplined on that. James, there might be color you want to add on expenses. I think our interest expense was down a little bit.
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: The operating expense line, really the focus ongoing right across the company, as John is referring to there, including Technology Solutions, and part of the business we've really been able to build our margins quite nicely. So directionally in line with what we were expecting, but we're certainly very pleased by the ongoing progress around our cost structure and our productivity.
Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Next we have Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much. John, when you called out North America and some of the things you talked about, you did talk a little bit about Specialty in your prepared remarks. Can you maybe just give us a little more detail as far as what you saw for revenue growth there in the quarter, especially versus your expectations?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We expected our Specialty business to grow above market levels. And I think not only did it grow above market levels, it grew more than we had expected. And I think our strength in particular in our community-based oncology business was very strong. Clearly, U.S. oncology continues to perform well. Albeit off of a slightly smaller base, our multi-specialty business is growing very rapidly as we create value-differentiating capabilities in that market.
Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, great. And then just on the follow-up side for the small acquisition that was made for Sainsbury, can you give us any indication as to what the earnings or financial impact will potentially be from that acquisition?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: It's obviously a very important strategic move for us. It significantly expands the presence of Lloyd's Pharmacies in the UK, and it's an endorsement of the strength of the Lloyd's brand and operating model. I think that's an important aspect to what this win signifies to our team and to the markets. James, you might want to comment on the timing and margin impact.
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Just based on our expected normal regulatory review process, we're expecting the transaction to close toward the end of February of this coming year, so I wouldn't expect it to have any material impact on fiscal 2016.
Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Next we have Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.
Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks and good evening. James, I just want to follow up on the gross margins a little bit. This was probably – the gross margins are probably a little bit lower than what we had thought and maybe the lowest gross margin we've seen in five or six quarters, and I'm curious. Can you maybe give us a little bit more color in terms of what impacted that gross margin? I don't know if that was tied into the generic inflation comments or if there's something related to the purchasing synergies from Celesio having kicked in or Rite Aid or Omnicare. Can you give us a little bit better sense of what's go on there?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Really I would point you to two comments that we made during our prepared remarks. First of all, very strong growth from our largest customers and therefore an impact on the mix and the margin, the gross profit margin profile. So that's number one; and then secondarily, the lesser effect around generic price increases than we were originally expecting in our plan.
Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, maybe I can just follow up on that. John, for those who have been following the company for a while, you may recall we always used to talk about branded price inflation every quarter. And we went through a long period where we didn't talk about it, and now it feels like we're talking about it every quarter again. Has anything changed with respect to your relationship with the manufacturers and the IMAs [Inventory Management Agreements] that you've historically had in place? And how do we think about branded price inflation as a driver maybe relative to the size of like, for example, what generic price inflation has done for the company?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks for the question. What's great about the business model that McKesson has been employing for a long time is that it has a lot of levers that we can use to help drive our performance over time. And as you point out, if you go way back to the early stages of my presence as the CEO, brand price inflation was the key driver that helped us drive our company. And over time, that became less important as a factor, but it always remained a factor. And so I think our comments today are more directional in nature related to our expectations brand price inflation came in higher than we anticipated. And as you point out, as we moved our model, we eliminated part of the variability or impact that branded price inflation has on our business model. And also as you recall, at one point in our evolution, generic price deflation was something we had to manage quarter to quarter, and now we've been in a period where we've actually experienced some inflation. So our comments there, once again, are directional in nature that it came below where we had anticipated. But we believe both brand and generic price inflation will remain important tools for us as we look out this fiscal year and beyond.
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Just perhaps to add one thing, recall that around a fifth of our relationships with the branded manufacturers are variable in nature, so the other 80% are a fixed fee-for-service type of structure.
Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, thank you.
Operator: We'll move now to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for the questions. Sorry to go back to this again, but it does seem like the biggest change relative to the update we got from you guys at your Analyst Day. You're pointing out a mid-single-digit margin expansion in the Distribution Solutions business. And I'm just curious if there's any more detail you can give around how much of that lower margin expectation is just from revenue mix versus the less generic inflation that you guys have called out. And I guess the bigger picture question, John, would just be given where Specialty is growing and the growth there, is margin expansion as we think about this business going forward, is it something that we should think about in a more tempered manner?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think the point on margin is a good one. We clearly didn't anticipate our revenues to be growing as rapidly as they have. And that has, as James mentioned, had a depressing effect on op margin. But if you actually look at operating profit growth, it's still very strong. And our objective is to satisfy the needs of our customers. And as you know, we have long-term contracts with many of them. So as they grow, the bigger ones will put some pressure on the mix. But the most important dimension here is I think our focus on making sure that we are driving efficiency in our operations as revenue grows, and that was pointed out earlier from an expense perspective. And we're disciplined in the way we approach the market. The comment about Specialty is an important one. That's a very high-growth area. Each company I think in the country probably defines specialty slightly differently, so it's difficult to talk to any one of us and get a perspective that's really industry-wide. From our point of view, there are some very profitable, positive mix products in the Specialty category, but there are also some products in the Specialty category that are really expensive and carry a margin rate that's low but produce tremendous returns and profit drop in the P&L. Albeit it may be dilutive to our margin expectations, they're certainly producing great returns. And I think that we have a responsibility to try to manage the company with both a perspective on margin rate as well as dollar growth and clearly at the bottom line the returns on our business. So we look at it in a portfolio way. If there's one message you can take away from me on the Specialty business, it has been a priority for us now for many years. We came from a very weak position to now we are in a very strong position, and I'm very pleased with where we are in that market. And as we define it, I think in most of them we're either number one or number two and growing very rapidly. So we are well positioned as we think out and look at the new product launches. Those launches, given the characteristics of some of them, could put some pressure on our margin rates. But clearly, we think that they'll be value-creating, and we're in the right position to take advantage of the relationships we have with our customers in the markets that we serve.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's helpful, and just a quick follow-up on the Celesio deal announced earlier today. Any sense you can give us on how we should think about the transaction as far as adding to your ultimate synergy target? And then the types of deals, is the type of deals we should expect to be building upon the Celesio acquisition?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Clearly, we are excited to have the business from a fundamental perspective beginning to stabilize and become more of a McKesson type of operation. We've always had a great view, a positive view of the resources and the people inside of Celesio. But as we talked about when we did the acquisition, there was some infrastructure and systems things we had to do and some strategy changes we had to make that would help us begin to get to a growth phase. I think we're entering the early stage of that growth phase. The deployment of capital we talked about as a possibility. You're beginning to see evidence of that. This type of acquisition fits right in with what we want to do. It's in a market that's extremely friendly to the utilization of generics and the incentives for both wholesalers and retailers to help their patients take generics. And so when we have an opportunity to expand our channel of generics in an important market like the UK, it drives synergy across the entire corporation through our global procurement operations that we talked about. So I think not only is it helpful to Celesio as a standalone opportunity and to LloydsPharmacy in particular, it's also helpful to McKesson overall as it builds on this 12,000 storefront base of business that we have out of the some odd 60,000 or 70,000 stores that we service, in the case of the 12,000 that are owned or banners of ours that buy off our portfolios. So it's important to recognize that pull-through buy power and the part of our strategy that this helps serve.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you so much.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yep.
Operator: Next we'll go to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.
Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI: Good afternoon, guys. So maybe on the Tech Solutions business. Obviously the reformation of that asset continues. It seems like the margin outlook for the year is good. If my math is right, is this going to be a year where we actually see EBIT growth and, not only that, but maybe get back to some of the higher levels of EBIT we saw historically? And secondarily, when do you actually think we can see some of the transactional businesses come through to where we could actually see the division grow again?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I appreciate the question, Ross. We have been, as you know, working diligently for the last several years to reposition the business in the areas where we think we are strong or market leading and where the markets are actually growing and are favorable to McKesson. We have extremely strong franchises inside of our Technology Solutions business. And we have been struggling with our hospital IT business, where we have been reinvesting in the go-forward products and deinvesting in the products that we've already announced that we plan to sunset. And so it's difficult as an investor to see the positive momentum in the business through some the drag that's present as a result of, as you described, the reformation of the business as we position it for growth going forward. And I think we are optimistic that we continue to make the right decisions to get the momentum back in the business. As to margins, I'll turn it over to James to talk a little bit about what you should think about there.
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: As we track towards that high-teens goal for fiscal 2016, I would say that right now we're looking at an increase in operating profit year over year, and that's excluding the $51 million benefit from the gain around the nurse triage business. So we're on track for some operating profit growth this year.
Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI: And maybe, James, there's been some momentum in DC on a tax holiday or the ability to repatriate some cash. I think you guys have roughly $2 billion or so offshore. How would that change your more medium-term capital allocation priorities? I know you have some of the debt maturities and you have the Celesio put. One, is that something you've been thinking about? And, two, would that free you up maybe to do a little more repurchase if it happened?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We feel as though we have a very nice mix in terms of our cash balance between what's domestically and what's held offshore. And we have spoken a few times about – obviously, yes, we have the upcoming debt maturities to take care of. Those are U.S. dollar denominated. But beyond that, our priorities for capital allocation are, first of all, internal investment and, second, looking at value creating M&A opportunities. And given the international breadth of our business now, we feel as though we have a nice balance in terms of the flexibility of the offshore cash that we have available for deployment as well as the domestic cash available for deployment. So we'll see how the tax discussions in Washington DC play out, but we already like the balance of cash that we have available to us, so we feel as though we have the degrees of freedom that we need.
Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI: Thanks so much.
Operator: We'll take Garen Sarafian with Citi Research.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. A couple follow-up questions at this point. First, sorry to harp on this again, but regarding moderating generic inflation, could you characterize that a bit more? Was it across the board, in certain therapeutic classes, vendor, anything?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I would just observe that we saw fewer manufacturers taking increases on fewer drugs. So both of those variables we saw less activity than we had certainly seen last year during our first quarter and less than what we were assuming we would see when we put our plans together.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And you mentioned Celesio performed better than expected. Maybe I missed it, but could you comment on what area of Celesio specifically exceeded your expectation thus far? Was it on the synergy front, top line?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I'd say the revenue was really right on track on a constant currency basis with what we were expecting during the first year. We continued to see strong performance out of the United Kingdom businesses. And we're seeing some modest improvements in the German environment, where obviously we've had something of a history of market discounting. We're seeing a little improvement in that discounting environment in Germany. Offsetting that, the French market is still looking like a challenging one. But net-net, we're pleased with the progress that we made at Celesio in Q1, and we feel as though we have more opportunities for the balance of the year.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): All right, great. Thanks.
Operator: We'll take David Larsen with Leerink.
David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC: Hi. Can you comment on the Teva and Allergan transaction? Is that material or not with respect to generic inflation? Our objection is that as the generic industry consolidates, sometimes manufacturers raise price because they can. Just any thoughts there would be helpful. Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We clearly have a very strong working relationship with both Teva and Allergan. And I think that we see, as do you, that the question of generic inflation is sometimes driven by the ability for the price to actually benefit the generic manufacturers or otherwise stick in the marketplace. And so to the extent that the consolidation provides some of that opportunity, that would be a positive. I think that the market remains competitive, and I think these consolidations will help eliminate costs. But I also think that McKesson's position in the market will continue to afford us an opportunity to work with these very large companies in a very positive way for both parties.
David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC: Great. And just any general thoughts around PCSK9 and how material that might be going forward? Maybe you can characterize the (47:07) benefit.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think it's difficult to tell. It's a little too early for to us comment on the characteristics of that product, albeit it is a positive, and the continued innovation that comes out in these categories of products will be extremely important to us going forward. And as I mentioned a few moments ago, our footprint in Specialty continues to grow. And I think that as people launch with some of these more unique products, it will help the patients, but it also will help McKesson.
David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC: Great, thanks a lot.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Operator: We'll take George Hill with Deutsche Bank.
George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. John, first a quick one, are there any situations where generic drug prices inflate where you guys don't benefit?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: George, I think drug price inflation and the benefit is in the eye of the beholder. I think all of us in the supply chain have different characteristics with manufacturers and with customers that are highly variable, including the relationships of both in terms of the way the business models work, but also the way the contractual relationships might work. So I think it's probably better said that we try to optimize our value to the generic companies in a way where we benefit and may benefit. But at the same time, we have to stay extremely disciplined and diligent around making sure that our customers are also benefiting through our action in the supply chain. And that's been our priority and will remain our priority.
George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, that's helpful, and maybe a quick follow-up on the Sainsbury transaction. It's interesting that this the second deal like this that's occurred in a little over a month. And as you see global payer consolidation, do you foresee global pharmacy consolidation? And how do you guys feel like you're positioned if global retail pharmacy consolidation steps up? Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think it's a good question. Obviously, we've seen tremendous consolidation across healthcare in the last 90 days alone. There has been all kinds of activity. I think the way we think about consolidation is clearly we want to be positioned with winners, but that doesn't necessarily mean that we have to be always positioned with only scaled players. In fact, we think our Health Mart customers, for example, are winners and are able to consolidate in their own space with other independent pharmacies because of the scale we bring to them and the value we can deliver. In fact, that's why I continue to focus on the footprint of owned and banner pharmacies, provide us the ability to help our customers would are perhaps not all owned by the same enterprise, continue to benefit through their relationship at McKesson and may be able to stay as independent operators. Even though they may appear on the surface to be subscale in terms of store count, they may improve their efficiencies through their partnership with us and clearly improve their margin structure through some of the value-added services that we help them deliver into the marketplace on behalf of payers and consumers. So our focus is to help our customers be more successful across the board. And to the extent that people consolidate and we consolidate into our customers, we win or at least break even from a revenue perspective. And our objective is to continue to be more and more efficient with these larger customers so that we can earn the privilege of continuing to serve them.
George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thank you.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Operator: We'll move next to Dave Francis with RBC Capital Markets.
David Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Good evening. John, let me take that answer and go a little bit further with it. To the extent that we are seeing consolidation among many players in the supply chain, including payers and obviously some on the retail side, do you foresee the need strategically or otherwise to potentially further consolidate and own additional assets within the supply chain, or are there inherent conflicts in that which will keep you from doing that? How do you best position the company to be most advantageously positioned going forward?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think it's a very good question. In fact, all of these questions are good questions. I think the industry is changing significantly. And I think it's incumbent upon us as it relates to our customers and our shareholders to remain open to any strategy that we think is sustainable and can create value. Having said that, it's always been our position that we don't compete with our customers. And so the challenge in some the conceived combinations would either have us competing with people that are on the partner/supply side of our business or perhaps on the partner/customer side of our business, and that makes it difficult to conceive of some of those types of combinations. So I think that we remain open to everything. We'll be very cautious before we ever cross the line of competing with our customers.
David Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great, thank you.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Operator: That does conclude our question and answer session. At this time, I'll turn it over to the speakers for any closing or additional remark.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Great, thank you, operator, and thanks to all of you on the call today for your time. McKesson is off to a good start for fiscal 2016, and I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. I want to recognize the outstanding performance of our employees and their contributions to driving better business health for our customers every day. I'll now hand the call over to Erin for her review of upcoming events in the financial community.
Erin Lampert - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, John. On September 16 we will present at the Morgan Stanley Global Healthcare conference in New York. And on November 10 we will present at the Credit Suisse Healthcare Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona. We'll release second quarter earnings results in late October. Thank you and goodbye.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call, everyone. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. Today's call is being recorded. If you have objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.
Erin Lampert - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, Vicky. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2015 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update and then James will review the financial results for the quarter and the full year. After James comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results amortization acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, certain claim and litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for investors. Please refer to our press release announcing fourth quarter fiscal 2015 results available on our website for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thanks and here's John Hammergren.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Our fourth-quarter results wrap up another year of outstanding earnings growth led by strong performance in our Distribution Solutions segment. For the full year, revenues increased 30% to $179 billion and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 29% over the prior year to $11.11. Fiscal 2015 was an exceptional year across McKesson as we deepened our relationships with our customers and manufacturing partners while expanding our scale in global reach. There are many achievements to highlight, but to name just a few. In fiscal 2015 we formally secured operating control of Celesio and created a global sourcing and procurement office in London. This office will lead our efforts since we partner with manufacturers to more efficiently and effectively provide pharmaceuticals across a wide variety of markets and geographies. During the year we demonstrated the strong value we provide to our U.S. Pharmaceutical customers as we successfully operationalized our agreement with Rite Aid and entered into an expanded relationship with Omnicare for both the sourcing and distribution of brand and generic pharmaceuticals. Our Medical-Surgical business met or exceeded all of our year two integration priorities related to the PSS acquisition, driving significant efficiencies in our IT and distribution infrastructure while maintaining the exceptional level of service our customers expect. We drove market-leading growth in our specialty business, expanding our position across oncology, rheumatology and ophthalmology and extending our track record of annual growth for new physicians joining the U.S. Oncology Network, and we continue to work alongside a growing number of partners in the CommonWell Health Alliance where we are beginning to see real-world progress in making the promise of data interoperability a reality. In addition to these terrific accomplishments, we generated $3.1 billion in operating cash flow for the year and continued our strong track record of creating value for our shareholders through our portfolio approach to capital deployment. I'm extremely proud of our accomplishments in fiscal 2015. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their leadership and constant focus on putting our customers' success at the forefront of everything we do. Today we also provided fiscal 2016 guidance of $12.20 to $12.70 per diluted share, representing an expected increase of 12% to 16% in adjusted earnings per share on a constant currency basis. This plan reflects strong growth across our businesses on top of the exceptional results in fiscal 2015. I'm excited about the outlook for our business and the momentum we have for fiscal 2016. We have a tremendous number of opportunities ahead of us, and I'm confident in our team's ability to continue to deliver innovative solutions that help our customers drive better business health. Turning for a moment to the broader industry environment, the key themes of an aging population are rise in chronic diseases and the challenge of containing costs remain important in the evolution of our industry. Against this backdrop it is encouraging to see great innovation taking place. Pharmacies continue to expand their value as convenient sites of care for patients by providing an ever-increasing set of services to help consumers better manage their health. In turn, consumers are more engaged in understanding the cost and quality of healthcare. With higher deductible plans becoming more prevalent and consumers playing a larger role in the selection of their health insurance through employers or exchanges, people are increasingly looking for transparency and data as they make more informed healthcare choices. The policymakers have set meaningful direction to support a transition to value-based care in the United States. Recently Congress overwhelmingly passed H.R. 2 which permanently replaces Medicare's sustainable growth rate system. The bill, which was signed by the President, provides needed reimbursement stability and predictability for providers in the near term while they transition to a more incentive-based payment system by the year 2019. The bill also contains provisions for healthcare data interoperability among other important provisions. I believe the passage of these measures and the bipartisan support for continued reforms intended to improve the efficiency of healthcare delivery in our country will continue to spur business innovation to solve healthcare's most critical challenges of cost, quality and access. McKesson stands unique in the industry for our depth of our relationships and strength of our experience across healthcare, and this positions us well to help our customers navigate ongoing challenges and emerge as stronger, more effective businesses. Moving now to our business results for the fourth quarter and the full year, Distribution Solutions had another excellent year led by outstanding performance in our U.S. Pharmaceutical distribution business. On a constant currency basis, full year fiscal 2015 Distribution Solutions revenue increased 33% and full year adjusted operating profit increased 31% compared to the prior year. Although adjusted operating margin in this segment declined modestly year-over-year, driven primarily by the impact of the mix of hepatitis C drugs, we remain confident in our ability to consistently expand operating margin over time. North America distribution and services, which includes our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, McKesson Specialty Health and McKesson Canada, delivered strong results for the year with 17% revenue growth on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. The U.S. Pharmaceutical business delivered tremendous growth in fiscal 2015, driven by the strong expansion of our generics business including growth of approximately 40% in our one-stop proprietary generics program. We are proud to be a full-service generic sourcing and distribution partner to an increasing number of our customers. Fiscal 2015 provided a visible platform for our U.S. Pharmaceutical team to demonstrate their ability to drive strong value to our in-house proprietary sourcing expertise and to drive efficiencies throughout the supply chain while strengthening the service levels our customers enjoy. In fiscal 2015 we also continued to perform well for our branded pharmaceutical manufacturing partners and maintained steady levels of compensation in return. And Health Mart maintained its strong record of growth during fiscal 2015 ending the year with nearly 3,800 stores or approximately 15% growth over the prior year. In summary, the U.S. Pharmaceutical team had an excellent year and I believe this business remains extremely well positioned for continued success. Our Canadian distribution business delivered solid results in fiscal 2015. In addition to maintaining market-leading position in pharmaceutical distribution in Canada, we continue to grow our extensive network of banner independent pharmacies across Canada where we now serve approximately 1,900 participating stores. The expansion of our private label generic pharmaceutical offering under the Sivem brand continues to exceed our expectations. And we're pleased with the exceptional growth and the expansion of our Canadian specialty business in fiscal 2015 which now includes more than 85 Inviva infusion clinics across Canada. Turning now to our U.S. Specialty business. In fiscal 2015 results were strong driven by growth across our portfolio of assets included in our oncology business as well as other specialty categories such as rheumatology and ophthalmology. I'm also pleased to report we continue to grow the number of physicians who choose to joined and further strengthen the U.S. Oncology Network. For the fourth year in a row, Black Book ranking placed McKesson's iKnowMed as the number one oncology electronic health record in the market. We continue to expand our services to both payers and manufacturers. We are working with payers using innovative payment models that tie quality to outcomes and have secured multiple contracts for value-based reimbursement in oncology care. And with manufactures we continue to be a key partner to our clinical trial research network and our comprehensive manufacturer facing solutions including commercial support, product distribution support and patient services. I want to acknowledge that there has been quite a lot of talk of late regarding biosimilars. We expect the biosimilar landscape to evolve over time and we believe this new category will play a growing role in the specialty market. The success of each biosimilar drug and drug class has many dependencies, including the channel of delivery, the disease which the drug addresses, physicians' views on quality and efficacy and the value delivered by various participants in the supply chain. Our comprehensive service offerings and capabilities put McKesson in an excellent position to provide value in this exciting and evolving market. In summary, North American pharmaceutical distribution and services delivered outstanding results in fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2016 we expect high single digit revenue growth compared to the prior year. Turning now to our results for international pharmaceutical distribution and services. Revenues were $26.4 billion for the full year, an increase of 5% on the underlying results of Celesio on a constant currency basis. I'm pleased with the progress we've made in the last five months since formally gaining operating control of Celesio. Our London-based procurement organization is off to a solid start and we still expect to generate between $275 million and $325 million in synergies by the end of fiscal 2019. We are making important long-term investments to upgrade the information technology infrastructure across Celesio and we continue to invest in refreshing our existing retail pharmacy footprint creating a differentiated health focused experience in our pharmacies and we are encouraged to see signs of more stable performance in important markets by Germany. And as previously announced, we have launched a sale process for the Brazilian businesses, PanPharma and Oncoprod, which are now reported in discontinued operations. For fiscal 2016 we expect that the international pharmaceutical distribution and services revenue will be roughly flat compared to the prior year on a constant currency basis. I'm pleased that our Celesio businesses are performing well and are well-positioned to execute on their operating plans and priorities. Our Medical-Surgical business delivered solid results with 5% growth in revenues in fiscal 2015. We have now completed year two of our three-year PSS World Medical integration plan and I'm pleased to report the team continues to meet or exceed expectations on all fronts. The Medical-Surgical team made significant progress in the integration distribution center network, migrations of critical IT systems and harmonization of our product portfolios in fiscal 2015. Fiscal 2016 represents the third and final year of integration work and we expect to complete consolidation of our distribution network and further integration of key IT systems across the business this year. I remain extremely impressed with our Medical-Surgical team and our ability to grow and expand the strong relationships we are privileged to have with our customers while keeping operational excellence at the center of everything that we do. For fiscal 2016 we expect Medical-Surgical revenue growth in the mid-single digits compared to the prior year. Overall I'm proud of our full-year operating performance in Distribution Solutions and believe we have strong momentum as we enter the new fiscal year. As we look ahead to fiscal 2016 we expect that Distribution Solutions revenue growth will increase by mid-single digits compared to the prior year, and we expect adjusted operating margin to expand by low double digit basis points compared to the prior year. Turning now to Technology Solutions. For the year Technology Solutions revenues were down 8% to $3.8 billion. Full-year adjusted operating profit was down 8% to $486 million. We remain encouraged by the strong results we see, particularly in our Relay Health Pharmacy and Connectivity businesses and our Payer Solutions business and by the signs of stabilization and growth that we see in our Medical Imaging business. At the same time we continue to take steps to further refine our portfolio of businesses. Our fiscal 2015 results were impacted by the anticipated year-over-year decline in our hospital software business, the planned elimination of a product line and the previously disclosed wind down of our international technology business. Looking forward to fiscal 2016 we expect Technology Solutions revenue to decline by mid-single digits year-over-year as growth in our Connectivity, Payer Solutions, Medical Imaging and provider revenue cycle businesses will be offset by an expected decline in our hospital software business and the pending sale of another business line. However, we expect adjusted operating margin in Technology Solutions will expand in fiscal 2016 to the low end of our long-term adjusted operating margin goal of high teens. In summary, we remain committed to helping our customers use information technology strategically to better enable business, better enable care and better enable connectivity. To wrap up my comments, I believe we have a strong plan for our fiscal 2016 that reflects growth across our broad portfolio of businesses. And we expect that both of our segments will expand operating margin and will reach the initial part of the range for the long-term adjusted operating margin targets we outlined at our investor day last June. We have the financial strength and discipline to continue to invest in the growth we expect across our businesses, and finally we are in businesses that continue to generate strong cash flow from operations. We expect that our cash flow from operations will be approximately $3 billion in fiscal 2016. I'm confident in our teams' ability to continue to deliver value to customers and the strong financial returns for our shareholders. We expect fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.20 to $12.70, representing 12% to 16% growth year-over-year on a constant currency basis. With that, I'll turn the call over to James for a detailed review of our financial results. James?
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As you just heard we are very pleased by our results for the quarter and for the full year. Our results reflect strong growth in our adjusted earnings from continuing operations per diluted share driven by the performance of our Distribution Solutions segment. In addition, our capital structure remained a source of financial strength as we generated strong operating cash flow and continued to leverage our portfolio approach to capital deployment. Today I will cover both the fourth quarter and full year results. I will also present guidance for fiscal 2016. As a reminder, we provide our guidance on an annual basis due to the seasonality and the quarter-to-quarter variability inherent in many of our businesses. Before I begin, there are two aspects of our financial results for our fourth quarter and full year that I would like to bring to your attention. First, our current year and prior year financials were recast to exclude the results of Celesio's operations in Brazil. The results from our business in Brazil and other businesses held for sale are reported as part of discontinued operations on Schedule 1 of the tables accompanying our press release. Brazil's operations drove a loss from discontinued operations per diluted share of approximately $0.10 for the quarter and for the full year. As part of the decision to sell the Brazilian business, we also recorded a $235 million after-tax impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of this business to its estimated net fair value. This impairment charge generated a loss of $0.99 per diluted share from discontinued operations for the fourth quarter and full year. Second, during the fourth quarter the euro traded at an average exchange rate of $1.12 per euro versus our prior expectation for a rate of $1.15 per euro. The recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar generated an incremental negative foreign currency translation impact of approximately $0.03 to our adjusted EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter versus our prior expectation. Now let's move to our results. My comments today will focus on our full year fiscal 2015 adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations of $11.11, which excludes four items: the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles; acquisition expenses and related adjustments; certain claim and litigation reserve adjustments; and LIFO-related adjustments. Now turning to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedules 2A and 2B, consolidated revenues increased 19% for the quarter and 30% for the full year to $179 billion. Adjusted gross profit increased 11% for the quarter to $3 billion, driven principally by an additional month of contribution from Celesio as we closed the acquisition in February 2014 of the same quarter last year. For the full year, adjusted gross profit increased 36% to $11.8 billion, primarily driven by our acquisition of Celesio and market growth, including strong execution in our Distribution businesses. Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.9 billion were up 9% for the quarter, driven mainly by the inclusion of an additional month of Celesio's operating expenses given the timing of our acquisition, as previously mentioned. For the full year, excluding the impact of Celesio, consolidated adjusted operating expenses increased 1%. Other income for the full year totaled $65 million. Full year adjusted interest expense increased 47% versus the prior year to $374 million, primarily driven by debt issued and assumed related to our acquisition of Celesio. For fiscal 2016, we expect our year-over-year interest expense to be less than the prior year based on $1.5 billion of planned debt repayments. Now moving to taxes, for the full year our adjusted tax rate was 30.6%, which reflects our mix of income and a number of discrete tax items. Our fiscal 2016 earnings outlook assumes an adjusted tax rate of approximately 31.5%, which is based on our expected mix of U.S. versus international earnings; however, this rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. For the full year, adjusted net income from continuing operations totaled $2.7 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $11.11. Overall, this year's adjusted earnings per share benefited significantly from our mix of business, specifically the favorable performance across our entire portfolio of generic pharmaceutical offerings, and the contribution from our acquisition of Celesio. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding increased by 1% year-over-year to 235 million. During the fourth quarter we completed a $340 million share repurchase, which fully exhausted the previously-granted board authorization. In addition, our board recently approved a new share repurchase authorization amount of up to $500 million. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding assumption for fiscal 2016 is 236 million. We expect to continue our historical portfolio approach to capital deployment while addressing upcoming significant debt maturities. Specific fiscal 2016 capital allocation priorities are as follows. Planning for existing debt maturities and thereby maintaining our investment-grade ratings, investing in our current businesses and reviewing opportunities to pursue value creating M&A. Let's now turn to the segment results which can be found on Schedules 3A and 3B. On a constant currency basis, Distribution Solutions total revenues increased 23% for the quarter and increased 33% for the full year. Revenue growth was driven primarily by our acquisition of Celesio and market growth in our North America pharmaceutical distribution and services business. During fiscal 2016, we anticipate Distribution Solutions revenues will increase by a mid-single digit percentage over the prior year driven by expected market growth and our mix of business. North American distribution business revenues increased 18% on a reported basis and 19% on a constant currency basis for the quarter. For the full year, revenues increased 17% on a constant currency basis driven primarily by market growth and our mix of business including revenues from the sale of drugs used in the treatment of hepatitis C. For fiscal 2016, we expect our North American distribution of business to deliver a high single digit percentage revenue growth compared to fiscal 2015. For the fourth quarter, international pharmaceutical distribution and services revenue increased 30% on a reported basis and 51% on a constant currency basis to $5.9 billion, reflecting one additional month of revenues as we closed our acquisition of Celesio in February 2014. For the full year, the underlying revenues of Celesio increased by 5% on a constant currency basis. For fiscal 2016, we expect Celesio's constant currency revenues to be approximately flat to the prior fiscal year. Moving now to the Medical-Surgical business, revenues were up 5% for the quarter and the full year driven by market growth. We continue to execute against our three-year PSS integration plan and perform well against our synergy business case. During fiscal 2016, we expect to complete the final year of our integration plan while delivering mid-single digit percentage revenue growth year-over-year. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit increased 46% for the full year on a 31% increase in segment revenues resulting in a 58 basis point improvement in our adjusted gross profit margin year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, segment adjusted gross profit increased 48%. Adjusted operating expense for the segment increased 59% on a reported basis and 62% on a constant currency basis for the full year driven primarily by our acquisition of Celesio and by the strong revenue growth within our North American distribution business. Excluding the impact of Celesio, our full year Distribution Solutions adjusted operating expense was up approximately 3% versus the prior year. As we look ahead to fiscal 2016, we expect continued growth in segment adjusted operating profit driven by the contribution from our generic business specifically from expanded one-stop sales and the breadth and depth of our global sourcing efforts. In addition, we expect branded pricing trends to be consistent with the prior year and anticipate generic drug pricing trends slightly below those observed in fiscal 2015. The segment adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 243 basis points, a decline of five basis points over the prior-year. This decline was primarily driven by a higher volume of branded drug sales including the sale of hepatitis C drugs and a lower than expected contribution from Celesio. Excluding the impact of the hepatitis C drugs, the segment adjusted operating margin was approximately 255 basis points for the quarter, up 7 basis points from the prior year. Distribution Solutions full year adjusted operating profit increased 30% to $4.2 billion and we ended the year with an adjusted operating profit margin of 238 basis points, a decline of three basis points over the prior-year. Again, this decline was driven by a higher mix of branded drug sales, in particular hepatitis C drugs. Excluding the impact of these hepatitis C drugs, segment adjusted operating margin was approximately 247 basis points, an increase of six basis points over the prior year. For fiscal 2016, we expect Distribution Solutions' adjusted operating margin to expand low double digit basis points compared to the prior year. Turning now to Technology Solutions, revenues were down 10% for the quarter and down 8% for the full year to $3.1 billion. This full year decline was primarily driven by the anticipated revenue softness of the hospital software platform, the planned elimination of a product line and the wind-down of our U.K. workforce business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses. Looking ahead to fiscal 2016, we expect Technology Solutions revenues to decline by a mid-single digit percentage as year-over-year growth in our payer-facing and connectivity businesses will be offset by an anticipated revenue decline in our hospital software business and the pending sale of a business line. Adjusted operating expenses in the segment decreased 14% for the quarter and 9% for the full year as a result of various cost management and restructuring initiatives. For the full year, adjusted operating profits decreased 8% to $486 million, primarily due to a lower revenue base and the wind-down of our U.K. Workforce business. Our full year adjusted operating margin remained flat to the prior year at 15.8%. During fiscal 2016, we expect to achieve an adjusted operating margin in the high teens. I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing. In addition, our working capital metrics also include Celesio. For receivables, our days sales outstanding decreased three days to 26 days. Our days sales in inventories decreased two days from the prior year to 31 days and our days sales in payables was approximately flat versus the prior year at 54 days. Our working capital management is illustrative of our continued focus on cash generation. During fiscal 2015, we reported $3.1 billion in cash flow from operations. We ended the year with a cash balance of $5.3 billion with $2.3 billion held offshore. Looking ahead, we expect cash flow from operations to be approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2016. Internal capital spending totaled $545 million for the full year, which includes spending related to Celesio. For fiscal 2016, internal capital spending is projected to be between $600 million and $650 million as we continue to develop our information technology infrastructure across McKesson and make incremental investments related to our retail pharmacy operations. Now I would like to briefly review some important considerations regarding our acquisition of Celesio and the related synergy case. Our current fiscal 2016 adjusted EPS guidance contemplates making measured progress towards achieving transaction synergies of $275 million to $325 million by the end of fiscal 2019. And as a reminder, the vast majority of these synergies represent procurement-related savings from our global sourcing efforts. You might recall that subsequent to achieving operating control in December 2014, McKesson consolidates 100% of Celesio's net income, and in exchange we are obligated to pay an annual guaranteed dividend of €0.83 per share to Celesio's non-controlling shareholders. And today, while we continue to consolidate 100% of Celesio's results from continuing operations, it is important to note that for fiscal 2016 we expect our ownership of Celesio to remain unchanged at 76%. Our dividend obligation to Celesio's non-controlling shareholders will be recorded controlled in the line titled net income attributable to non-controlling interest on Schedule 1 and is expected to drive a fiscal 2016 expense of approximately $44 million or about $11 million per quarter assuming our 76% ownership stake at an exchange rate of $1.10 per euro. Now before I conclude, I would point out that in today's press release we detailed the key assumptions underlying our fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings from continuing operations per diluted share of $12.20 to $12.70. As always, our plan includes certain risk but overall we see significant opportunities to create continued value for our shareholders, customers and business partners in fiscal 2016. Our plan calls for outstanding growth on fiscal 2015 results that were exceptionally strong and represents adjusted EPS expansion of 12% to 16% on a constant currency basis. Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our first question from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.
George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good afternoon, guys, and thank you very much for taking the question. John or Jim, maybe just a little bit on Celesio. You guys – Celesio has put forward the plan to delist the shares. How should we think about how that accelerates whether or not investors in Europe are going to put the shares back to McKesson? And, I guess, can you guys provide us any update on when we might expect to see the shares delisted?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, George, I think the objective we have is to focus on down listing now and it will probably lead or could lead to delisting in the end but our focus now is to down list. It provides certain efficiencies and it streamlines some of our reporting requirements in Europe. As to how the minority shareholders may behave as a result of this, it certainly would be speculation on my part. As you know they have a price that's already been fixed through this process that they can put their shares to us and clearly we'd have an obligation to buy them at those prices and to the extent that this accelerates their interest in doing so then we have to have the wherewithal available to us to make that transaction possible, but I guess other than that I don't have much else to say about it.
George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Then maybe just a quick follow up would be, you are a few more months now into your majority ownership of Celesio. Any kind of surprises or anything new the company's learned either to the positive or the negative side? Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: That's a good question. I appreciate it. I think that as you might have noticed in the quarter we announced that we were going to put for sale our Brazilian assets and I think that's an example of what McKesson typically does in these types of situations, is to look carefully at the portfolio of businesses that are represented, particularly in a large asset like Celesio, and begin to focus our efforts and our management team on those assets that we believe will deliver the best long-term value for our company and for our shareholders. And as such this portfolio modification or optimization was contemplated and announced as a result. We continue to be very encouraged by the progress we're making in the U.K., in particular in our retail strategies. Several of our other markets are performing well and we are continuing I think to make progress. You may have noticed in the conversation, I talked about the revenues being relatively flat and it's principally driven by two factors, and that is in addition to the Brazilian operation going into discontinued ops, the Norway business loss, the large hospital customer, which affected our revenues in that market, and we also continue to have some challenges in the French market as reimbursement continues to be a pressure point there. But I would say that we see signs of Germany continuing to stabilize and as I mentioned the U.K. business in particular is performing well.
George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much. John, can you maybe just give us an update on the London procurement operation? At what point, what percentage of contracts have you signed, I mean just to give us an indication as to how much more work you have to do on the procurement side?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, thanks for the question, Lisa. As you know, we were delayed in getting operational control of Celesio, so it delayed our ability to really begin to execute against the procurement synergies that we believe exist for us as we create a global footprint and a single relationship with these manufacturers on a global basis. And so that work was delayed. As I mentioned, we've launched that opening of that office in January. We're in the midst of our discussions with, as you might imagine, the very largest of our manufacturing partners, talking about how we can streamline the relationship between our companies and make sure that they win when we win, and those discussions are probably too early to describe relative to how far along we are or certainly percentages of completion. I would say that we're getting a terrific response, however, and the manufacturers are eager to work with a company like McKesson where we can deliver such significant value. And I think it also helps that we can sort of have a unified message globally with what we're trying to do. And clearly our footprint in the U.S., our strength with Rite Aid, our strength with Omnicare, our Health Mart capabilities, I mentioned the 1,900 banner pharmacies in Canada along with the several thousand pharmacies in Europe, both owned under the Lloyds brand as well as franchised, give us a significant footprint that manufacturers are very interested in. So I'm excited about the early progress and we'll clearly keep you guys informed as we continue to make progress.
Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And in fact just staying on that generic theme, I was surprised to hear in fiscal 2016 you expect generics to be below 2015. Is that because of the timing of the way Nexium came in, or am I missing something as I just look at what's expected to lose patent protection over the next 12 months?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: That's a good question. I think we actually expect more dollar value of generic launches, or I should say branded generic launches – launches of branded drugs in fiscal 2016 than there were in 2015. So you're right, there's more dollar value of product going generic. I think as we look at our portfolio of generic estimates, we frankly see the character and characteristics of some of those generics being not quite as favorable for us as the launches that took place in FY 2015. So an example would be a generic that might have many, many participants, and the value back to the supply chain as a result of that competitive activity wouldn't be as great. So I would just say there are some nuancial differences between our view of the portfolio of generics. It's not so much size-based as it is characteristic of the launches.
Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thanks, John.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yep.
Operator: We'll go next to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for the question. You're obviously ending with a cash balance very strong, over $5 billion. It looks like the free cash flow you're calling for in fiscal 2016, about $2.4 billion. And based on your comments, both John and James, it sounds like maybe share repurchases for next year aren't quite as high a priority as M&A. I'm curious if A, there's anything specific leading to this maybe slight re-prioritization for next year? And then, John, I guess more importantly, can you share maybe what in your mind are the priorities right now as you think about where you maybe want more exposure across healthcare?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Why don't I start with the answer and let James fill in some of the details. Clearly based on our belief at this point and what we've described as our expectations for fiscal 2016, we will have a very strong balance sheet at the end of the year. We've also talked about our priority related to maintaining investment grade. We did talk in the call about debt that's going to be extinguished this year as it comes due and in an earlier conversation we talked about the rights of the minority shareholders of Celesio. So there are some uses of capital including internal investment that James and I have described for fiscal 2016 that will consume some of this financial strength. We've also talked over time about our – in addition to the priority of remaining investment grade, the priority of high-value transactions and the ability for McKesson to execute on those transactions in a strategic way that produces very positive returns, above our cost of capital returns, for our shareholders. And that remains a priority as well. And we did talk about the board approving a $500 million repurchase, which is not insignificant as it relates to share buybacks. So I think you'll continue to see us unfold our strategy as the year goes on and we're cognizant of the fact that our balance sheet remains a source of opportunity for us and we plan to use that opportunity judiciously on behalf of our shareholders.
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I would just further emphasize that I think it's helpful to have some cash balance flexibility to allow us to take advantage of attractive M&A if it should come along during this period of delevering.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's fair. And I guess just a quick follow up on some of the comments you made around follow-on biologics or biosimilars, John. I know you don't typically get into individual drug launches but given this is kind of the first of its kind, I was wondering if you could maybe share your thoughts around how you think about biosimilar in Neupogen coming to the market and whether or not there's anything factored into the guidance around that launch or potential launch I should say?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, you hit in a very key comment there about potential launches. So I think that it relates to our fiscal 2016 guidance and the uncertainty related to biosimilars and their uptick we have nothing included in our guidance related to biosimilars. I would say that I think the company is well-positioned to hit the biosimilar space. As you know, we have a very active specialty business and we have a complete array of services that could be provided to a bio similar manufacturer which we think will launch in a very similar way to branded manufacturers launches in terms of the support for patients, the special handling requirements, the reimbursement requirements, the physician contact that needs to happen. And we do that in a significant way today. In addition, I might add any of the biosimilars that we'll be focused on the oncology market are particularly attractive to us because of our physician network. And the U.S. Oncology Network has a track record of helping branded companies come to market through our clinical trial work and we also have the ability to create formularies when they're convinced that from a clinical perspective the product can be selected and defined for the patients in a way that delivers best-in-class quality and lowest possible cost. So, I think that unique asset in US Oncology will play a role here over the years as biosimilars come to market in the oncology class.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: It should be interesting to watch how it plays out. Thanks, John.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: We'll go next to Dave Francis with RBC Capital Markets.
David Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for the question, guys. John, I'm curious. It's – I know your business is kind of second derivative in nature but with King Burwell kind of weeks away from a decision of the Supreme Court, how would you view a negative Supreme Court ruling on ACA subsidies relative to your outlook on the core U.S. Pharmaceutical and Med-Surg business?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, it's been difficult for us all along to quantify ACA's effect on the demand in our businesses albeit we do believe there is a positive effect associated with people getting access to care in the fashion that ACA is providing. I would say that in my conversation with people on the Hill and at the state level around markets, I believe that the countries are going to have to position itself to take care of folks that are not able to afford their own care or to do so in a way that is an effective and efficient for the businesses and for our country. And so I think the end result or even if something were to come from the Supreme Court ruling that may put a question mark on the subsidy or support for these patients I think that there'll be a quick reaction on the Hill to try to find another way to provide low-cost quality care to patients so they don't fall through the crack and end up in the emergency rooms in America. And I would remind also to the listeners that know this well that pharmaceutical use and the appropriate use of pharmaceuticals and primary care physicians is the best way to treat patients as opposed to letting them their situations falter and having them end up in an acute situation in one of our Great American hospitals and that I think needs to be avoided. So, I think it's early to call but I think that this combined with the continued pressure from the demographic perspective and all the things that we see from a growth and opportunity perspective in our industry keeps me very excited about the future for McKesson.
David Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC: That's helpful. And a quick follow up, flipping over the IT side of the business with the doc fix legislation and some of the focus there being on interoperability and what have you, what do you see as kind of the status of CommonWell and opportunities relative to both CommonWell continued move forward and revenue opportunities for Relay Health in particular as it relates to work that you guys do in there? Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, thanks for the question. We are excited to be a participant in CommonWell, and as you know the CommonWell is a not-for-profit gathering of roughly 70% or so of the systems provider volumes in the country for physician offices and hospitals, and that aggregation of technology companies who have decided to come together and create a method by which we can move information between our non-native systems or between each other's competitors' systems, said another way, is a landmark opportunity for this country to actually get interoperability and exchange data in a way that's never been done before. So this opportunity for McKesson, I guess, translates into our ability to continue to support CommonWell's mission through the services that have been offered by Relay Health, and Relay is one of probably many in the future providers of capabilities to CommonWell that will facilitate this movement of patient data and financial data that'll be very helpful. So I'm quite excited about it. I'm frankly right now more excited about what it's going to do for healthcare in this country than I am necessarily for the revenues of Relay, which will follow over the years. But I think the adoption curve is going to be steep and I think people are going to benefit from CommonWell's efforts.
David Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yep.
Operator: We'll go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, hi. Good afternoon, and congrats on a great quarter and guidance. A couple follow-up questions. First on the Tech Solutions, so, John, obviously you expressed your excitement around CommonWell, but when you think about the Tech Solutions segment in performance over the last few years, when you think about the different parts of the business does the segment still fit strategically with the rest of the McKesson portfolio?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Why, I think the way we think about our technology businesses is the value that it delivers to customers and our ability to make sure that we're delivering against those needs. As we think about the overall portfolio of McKesson's companies, you can see that we are always active in our management of that portfolio, and that's frankly one of the reasons that the Technology Solutions segment, which is an aggregation of many different companies, revenue has been down as a result of that portfolio activity. But there are assets in there that are very directly correlated to other business unit strategies in our corporation. It could be things like our Relay pharmacy business, which is the connectivity provider for most of America's pharmacies, or it could be our outsourcing business for physician offices, which is heavily correlated with our practice management activities where we're supporting the efforts of community oncology or community physician work, and then there's other businesses that may not be as correlated to the strategy of the rest of our businesses, and in those cases the key for us is can we optimize the performance of those companies as standalone companies vis-à-vis their competitors. So I don't ever rule anything in or out on any of our businesses relative to our strategy. I think I look at it as an evolution, and we need to continue to do so, and we need to make sure that we optimize the value and the performance of these businesses on behalf of our shareholders.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And one follow up that's related to questions that we're getting from investors. Obviously there's a lot of chatter out there about potential M&A of some clients of yours and some of them have longer-term contracts. So do these contracts typically have a change of control clause in them? If you can just clarify that.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think the industry's going to continue to be filled with chatter and clatter related to strategic partnerships and mergers and acquisitions, and certainly people in our healthcare industry that promulgate some of these discussions and rumors more than others. McKesson as a policy, really doesn't – we don't talk about our customer contracts, and we certainly don't talk publicly about M&A or potential M&A. We have very solid relationships with our customers. We've earned the right to have their business for years and sometimes decades, and as you know, we've currently earned the right in several cases of expanding our relationship with our customers to include all of the purchasing of their generics and the distribution of their business. And I might also note that we have a very broad base of customers. So we clearly, to the extent that we – that our relationship with one customer changes, hopefully we're at the same time expanding relationships with others. So all I can tell you is we stay close to our customers and in many cases if a customer changes from an ownership perspective, McKesson stays with that customer even into the new entity from a service perspective and you might recall, Ricky, when CVS purchased Caremark we were fortunate to have CVS continue the Caremark relationship with McKesson. So I think there are many examples where you will see M&A activity and McKesson maintains the relationship.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Steven Valiquette with UBS.
Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess just from me just a quick question on the FY 2016 guidance. While EPS at the midpoint is just a touch below The Street consensus, it seems to me, it may just be due primarily to slightly higher tax rate year-over-year also that that flash share count $500 million buyback authorization. I my sense is investors probably are not going to be too concerned about but I guess for me just big picture, just curious that there's still potential for the combined company tax rate to still come down over the next few years despite the fact that they may be up a little in FY 2016. Thanks.
James A. Beer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, the tax rate guidance that we've offered for FY 2016 reflects the expected mix of profits between our international businesses, which tend to be taxed at a lower rate versus our domestic businesses. And recall, of course, those domestic businesses have been growing very nicely in recent years. And so that's a fact in the thought behind the 31.5% tax rate guide for fiscal 2016. We're not looking to try to project out beyond fiscal 2016 at this point in time.
Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.
Operator: We'll go next to Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.
Glen J. Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks, and good evening. I also wanted to follow up with one quick question on the guidance. It seems like one of the components of your guidance you talk about maybe lower pricing on the generic side in fiscal 2016 versus fiscal 2015. It's kind of nice to have a conference call that is not dominated about generic price inflation but, John, I'm kind of curious. Could you give us your perspective in terms of what you are seeing there? And are you actually seeing any changes in the market? Or do you just believe it's prudent to assume some level of normalization? Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, Glen, I think you hit the same word I was going to use and that was prudent. I think we've seen a very robust cycle of generic inflation at least as we view it. And clearly, we expect it to continue at least we expect it to moderate as we give our guidance for next year to the extent that our prudent guidance proves to be incorrectly low and then at some point we'll over achieve our expectations to the extent that we projected to be too high in our crystal ball, then we'll be disappointed with what happens with the generics. But I think overall we remain very optimistic about our portfolio and how we manage it and I think we get good job of forecasting where the business is going to be.
Glen J. Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Operator: We'll go next to Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi, thanks very much. First I was just hoping that perhaps you could size the U.S. Specialty business and growth rate? But really my question is around specialty pharmacy. To be fair you have a specialty pharmacy operations ex-U.S. You interact with patients in U.S. Oncology. You own pharmacies, you have pharmacy franchises globally. So I'm just not sure why specialty pharmacy would truly be a foreign business to you, no pun intended on that or why you might not actually be interested in moving more in that direction and I'll leave it at that. Thanks so much.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, thanks for the question. We are in the Specialty Pharmacy business in various aspects of our strategy. And certainly if you think about it globally, particularly where we own pharmacies we have specialty pharmacy activity and you pointed out oncology is one example. I think we've always been sensitive to supporting our customers and their activities and we are reluctant to compete with our customers in any real significant way. So to the extent that specialty pharmacy can support our overall strategy and not be in conflict with what our customers expect from us and we'll continue to pursue and it in certain areas it makes a lot of sense for us to be there and in other areas it makes sense for us to support other people's Specialty Pharmacy businesses.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Is there any chance I could get you to put some figures around the size of specialty overall in the U.S., and the growth rate, you did mention you were growing above market?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No chance.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): What do you think the market's growing?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Slower than we are.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Fair enough. Have a good night.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks.
Operator: We'll go next to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: Good afternoon. So, sticking on sort of the international parts of the business, you've owned the asset now for some time, you guys have done a tremendous job historically of rolling up various industries and obviously you have plenty of firepower to do deals. What have you learned about the various geographies so far where you play and where you don't play? And what is sort of your view of Brazil? How did that impact your view in emerging versus more developed markets to move into with that asset? And then how would you characterize valuations in some of those geographies versus what we see in the U.S., so a kind of a broad-reaching question on the M&A outlook in some of those newer markets?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Ross, that's a very interesting question and I think it has a very complex answer that is – that I'll try to deal with. I think the way we think about Europe is the way I think about McKesson 16 years ago when I landed in this seat. How do we – how can we optimize the performance of the businesses we have and focus on those businesses and then how do we branch from those businesses to adjacencies that we know how to operate in markets where we can compete. And I think the situation with Brazil, it was not obvious that we could create a market-leading strategy there particularly given the vertical nature of some of the retailers in that market. And nuances associated with the business models down there and clearly whether it was scaled properly, et cetera, that I think the conclusion was reached that we should have our focus on Europe and in those markets where we currently have a strong beachhead. And in many of those markets we're number one or number two already from a distribution or a retailing perspective. And in many of those markets the hospital business is still direct, the specialty business is nascent. There aren't a lot of services that are similar to what we provide here in the U.S., both to manufacturers and to the end customers. And so I think we do see an opportunity both through organic growth as well as M&A in several of those markets and that'll be part of our focus as we think about the strength of our balance sheet.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI: That's perfect. It's 6 o'clock, so I'll end there.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks. I know there are a few other folks that are still on the line hoping to ask questions. So if you want to go a little bit further I'm happy to do that.
Operator: We will go next to David Larsen with Leerink.
David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC: Yes. Congratulations on a great quarter. Can you just highlight again what the growth rate was in the OneStop Generics program? I thought I heard a very high number? And then maybe some descriptions around what drove that would be very helpful. Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, the OneStop program has been and continues to be very successful for us and this last year, the number I quoted was a 40% growth rate year-over-year, which was quite significant. Now, obviously a portion of that was our success with Rite Aid but the business still grew very significantly even outside of the Rite Aid business.
David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: We will go next to Garen Sarafian with Citigroup.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks for taking the question. I want to ask on Health Mart. The growth of 15% seems much stronger than the market so what portion of this is due to market growth as you define it? And where is the remainder of the growth coming from? Is it more taking share or small change that you did, (62:06) some of these activities in-house that are now going to the Health Mart franchise? Can you just elaborate there a little bit?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Just to be clear, the growth rate was in store count not in revenue of those stores. And so the stores, I'm sure some of them did come from competitors but I would imagine there's a portion of them that just came from great customers that have been doing business with us for a while and realized that Health Mart added a bigger opportunity for us and for them, and that expansion of our footprint with them and the services we provide gave us a better position with those customers. So it expands our footprint at Health Mart across the country and our objective with our customers is hopefully to earn the privilege to be Health Mart for all of them, obviously with the exception of the large chains which are creating their own brands.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. And then the follow up is just a bigger picture question, of ongoing M&A among pharmaceutical manufacturers and what we read about in the press. To ask the question a little bit differently though, at what point would you begin to get concerned of too much consolidation in the pharmaceutical space?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I'm not concerned yet, and I would say that the manufacturing advantages (63:26) we have are very significant. Clearly to the extent that we can create value by delivering channel or volume to them, they're interested in working closely with us, and that's our objective. And I certainly don't see on the horizon a situation where manufacturers no longer need McKesson as part of their solution.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: We'll go next to Eric Percher with Barclays.
Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks for sneaking me in there. A simple one would be, the London organization that you've created, is that independent from the international distribution business, meaning it doesn't roll up – the profits would roll up within the Celesio business?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, Eric, I guess the best way to describe it is that it's a separate operation that is organized in London and it reports directly to Paul Julian, and its job is to focus on a global relationship with large global manufacturers. And as to the financial effect of those businesses, of this activity, you probably would find it in many different parts of our corporation, including maybe even Medical Supplies as we source globally for medical supplies and private label. So it really will – it'll end up in various P&Ls as success is reached there.
Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yep.
Operator: At this time we have no further questions so I return the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I certainly want to thank everybody for their time today and for being on the call. I know we ran a little bit over but it was our year end and we spent a little time chatting, so I wanted to make sure that we spent some time making sure we have all of your questions answered. We think we have a very strong operating plan for fiscal 2016 and certainly exciting growth opportunities across McKesson. I'm certainly proud of our track record of delivering value to our customers and strong financial returns to our shareholders and to each of you, and I'm certainly proud of our terrific McKesson team which continues to deliver year in and year out. So with that, I'll turn it over to Erin for upcoming events for the financial community.
Erin Lampert - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, John. I have a preview of some upcoming events. We will participate at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Healthcare Conference in Las Vegas tomorrow, May 13, and the Goldman Sachs Global Healthcare Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes on June 9. We look forward to seeing you at one of these upcoming events. Thank you, and goodbye.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.
Erin Lampert: Thank you, Travis. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson's Fiscal 2015 Third Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update and will then introduce James, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after 1 hour at 6 p.m. Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and LIFO-related adjustments. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for our investors. Please refer to our press release announcing third quarter fiscal 2015 results available on our website for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thanks. And here's John Hammergren.
John H. Hammergren: Thanks, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Today, we reported solid results for the third quarter, with total company revenues of $47 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.89. In addition to the solid execution across our business, our third quarter results benefited from a pull-forward of certain brand price increases into the quarter, which had previously been anticipated in the fourth quarter. Our third quarter results also reflect a lower-than-expected tax rate driven by the intense enactment of recent legislation. James will address both of these items in further detail in his remarks. I'm pleased with the strong performance of our business for the first 9 months of the fiscal year. We've updated our outlook and now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $10.80 to $10.95 for fiscal 2015. Before I begin my review of our business results for the quarter, I will provide a brief update on our acquisition of Celesio. During the third quarter, we achieved an important milestone with the formal registration of the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement. As I mentioned in my remarks last quarter, with this milestone now complete, McKesson and Celesio can begin our cooperative work to deliver the synergy case we have outlined, where we expect to achieve $275 million to $325 million in annual synergies by the end of fiscal 2019. We've established a new global procurement and sourcing office based in London to begin the work associated with realizing the synergy case we have outlined. The team, consisting of seasoned executives from both McKesson and Celesio, will focus on expanding our relationships with our manufacturing partners and further building upon our global sourcing capabilities. As the needs of the health care industry continue to evolve, broader global reach, channel influence and greater purchasing scale are increasingly important. We're excited to serve our customers as one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesalers and providers of health care services in the world. Moving now to our business results. Distribution Solutions had strong results in the third quarter with revenue of $46.3 billion, up 38% as reported and up 39% on a constant-currency basis. Distribution Solutions' adjusted operating profit was $1 billion in the third quarter, up 33% as reported and up 34% on a constant-currency basis. North American distribution and services, which includes our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, McKesson Specialty Health and McKesson Canada, delivered strong results for the third quarter, with 17% revenue growth on a reported and constant-currency basis compared to the prior year. This growth was primarily driven by strong growth within our existing customer base, including further penetration of our generics programs, solid market growth and the demand for recently launched drugs for the treatment of hepatitis C. Our U.S. Pharmaceutical business continues to deliver excellent value for our customers. During the third quarter, we were extremely pleased to have expanded our long-standing relationship with Omnicare, the nation's largest institutional pharmacy and a leading specialty pharmaceutical services provider. For over 10 years, Omnicare has partnered with McKesson for the distribution of branded pharmaceuticals. As part of our expanded agreement, McKesson will now have responsibility for the sourcing and distribution of generic pharmaceuticals as part of McKesson's proprietary, OneStop Generics program. We are proud of the value we deliver as our customers choose McKesson as not only their distribution partner but also their sourcing partner. Our customers value the strength of our OneStop program, our industry-leading service levels and the working capital efficiencies we are able to drive on their behalf. We also created outstanding value across our independent pharmacy customer base. I'm pleased to share that Health Mart was recently named Pharmacy Innovator of the Year by Drug Chain Review (sic) [Chain Drug Review], a leading pharmacy industry publication. We are proud to accept this award on behalf of all of our independent pharmacies who are in the front line caring for patients every day. This recognition acknowledges Health Mart for its commitment to giving member pharmacies the tools they need to thrive in their markets, its efforts to enhance and expand the scope of pharmacy practice and the pharmacy's consistent high-level performance in terms of patient satisfaction. We are privileged to partner with our Health Mart pharmacy customers and to provide the tools that enable them to grow their business and enhance the deep relationships they have with their customers. In summary, our U.S. Pharmaceutical business continues to deliver tremendous results as we strengthen and expand our relationships with our customer base. Turning now to our specialty business. We had another quarter of excellent results. In addition to the strength of our oncology business and the growth we are driving in other specialties, such as ophthalmology and rheumatology, McKesson's Specialty Health offers a tremendous value proposition to our pharmaceutical manufacturing partners. Our specialty manufacturing services span across the entire pharmaceutical life cycle, from R&D to post-commercialization and maturity. We are unique as a partner to manufacturers in facilitating clinical trials. US Oncology has conducted more than 1,400 clinical trials including 120 early phase studies, and more than 60,000 patients have participated in these trials conducted by US Oncology. US Oncology Research has participated in the development of more than 300 investigational products, including 51 FDA-approved cancer therapies, which represents nearly 1/3 of cancer therapies approved by the FDA to date. Manufacturers value our deep clinical understanding and the expertise through our provider-centered organization. We also have a leading technology set of assets customized for the needs of specialty providers and focused on driving better patient outcomes. And as the leader in community oncology, we have the benefit of tremendous scale in the market. I am pleased with the strong results of our specialty business in the quarter and believe we remain very well positioned to serve our customers and partners in this exciting market. Our Canadian business had another solid quarter with the results that were consistent with our expectations. In addition to the growth at our core distribution business, we are driving great results with our extensive base of independent pharmacies operating under one of our many banners, the expansion of our private-label generics program, Sivem, and the growth in our specialty business in Canada. Turning now to our results for international pharmaceutical distribution and services. Revenues for the third quarter were $7.3 billion, an increase of 7% on the underlying results of Celesio on a constant-currency basis. As I mentioned earlier, we are extremely pleased to have reached a key milestone on achieving operating control of Celesio during the third quarter. We're only just beginning to work -- to do the work to bring together these 2 great organizations, and I remain excited about the opportunities we see as we move forward together. Turning to our Medical-Surgical business. Revenues were $1.6 billion for the first quarter, an increase of 7% over the prior year. We continue to see solid growth across the alternate site markets we serve, and our third quarter results also reflect an increase in sales of flu vaccines and supplies compared to the prior year. We are entering the third and final year of our PSS integration efforts. We remain on track to deliver the synergies we had previously outlined, and I continue to be impressed with the progress made by our Medical-Surgical team. In summary, Distribution Solutions performed well in the third quarter, driving excellent service and value for our customers and delivering strong financial results. Technology Solutions' revenues were down 7% for the third quarter, driven primarily by anticipated revenue softness in our Horizon clinical software platform and the planned elimination of a product line, both contemplated in the original guidance we provided in fiscal 2015. Adjusted operating margin in the segment was 16.3% in the quarter, consistent with our expectations for this business. I am pleased with the progress we've made as we evolve our Technology Solutions portfolio. Increasingly, we are hearing about the shift toward value-based reimbursement in the delivery of health care. Just last month, the Department of Health & Human Services announced the goal of tying the vast majority of traditional Medicare payments to quality or value metrics by 2016. At McKesson, we are focused on helping our customers prepare for this shift to value-based reimbursement. And we have the unique expertise and set of solutions to position our customers for success as their businesses evolve. The important component of the shift to value-based care is enabling patients and providers to have a holistic view of the patient across different settings of care through data interoperability, which is why we are proud members of the CommonWell Health Alliance. The CommonWell Health Alliance continues to expand, with new members joining, additional studies of care added and more provider sites going live. Through CommonWell, we are committed to leading the industry towards a vision of patient-centered interoperability that moves us well beyond the challenges of today's point-to-point exchange towards an environment where the right health information is available to the patient at the right time. We will continue to focus on our key strategic priorities for Technology Solutions, including helping our customers reduce cost and operate more efficiently, providing our customers with solutions to drive improved analytics and supporting our customers' transformation to a world of value-based care. Now to wrap up my comments for Q3. We delivered solid results in the third quarter and I'm pleased by the great execution we have seen across our business. We've updated our outlook for the full year and now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $10.80 to $10.95 for fiscal 2015. In addition to the solid operating performance in the third quarter, we continue to have a strong balance sheet. For the first 9 months of the fiscal year, we generated cash flows from operations of $1.2 billion, and our expectation to deliver cash flows from operations of approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2015 remains unchanged from our original guidance. With that, I'll turn the call over to James. And we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?
James A. Beer: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As you've just heard, we are pleased with our third quarter operating results, driven by the solid performance of our Distribution Solutions segment. Late in the third quarter and consistent with our expectations, we secured operating control of Celesio. As we look ahead, we are working to execute against our previously articulated synergy case and are beginning our integration efforts. Today, I will walk you through our third quarter consolidated financial results and I will also provide an update on our fiscal 2015 outlook. Later in my remarks, I will highlight revisions to our financial statement presentation, subsequent to achieving operating control of Celesio, alongside key transaction milestones and assumptions. Before I review our third quarter results, there are 4 items that I'd like to bring to your attention that I hope will give you a better perspective on our performance in the quarter. First, in addition to the solid execution across our business, our third quarter results were aided by a lower-than-expected tax rate, primarily due to the passage of recent legislation. The related reduction in our tax expense for the quarter contributed approximately $0.13 to our adjusted earnings. Second, our third quarter Distribution Solutions' adjusted operating profit reflects a timing benefit, primarily from a pull-forward of certain brand price increases from our fiscal fourth quarter into our fiscal third quarter. This benefit contributed approximately $0.09 to our adjusted earnings. Third, during our second quarter earnings call, we discussed our average exchange rate assumption of $1.31 per euro, applicable to our fiscal 2015 adjusted EPS guidance range. While currency rate movements did not have a material impact on our adjusted EPS during the first half of our fiscal year, I indicated that we expected a negative foreign currency translation impact of approximately $0.04 during the second half of fiscal '15. The actual adjusted EPS impact from currency movements during our fiscal third quarter was approximately $0.03 per share. Given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we are now assuming an average exchange rate of $1.15 per euro in the fourth quarter. This would drive a negative foreign currency translation impact of approximately $0.04 to our adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter. In summary, the negative foreign currency translation impact on our full year adjusted EPS, as compared to our original plan, is now anticipated to be approximately $0.07 versus the previously guided $0.04. Lastly, we realized a $0.05 benefit from an update to our accounting for the noncontrolling interest in Celesio, which I'll cover later in my remarks. We now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $10.80 to $10.95 for fiscal 2015, based on a full year average exchange rate of $1.29 per euro. Now let's move to our results. My remarks today will focus on our third quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $2.89, which excludes 3 items: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles; acquisition expenses and related adjustments; and LIFO-related adjustments. Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedule 2A. Consolidated revenues increased 37% for the quarter to $47 billion. On this 37% revenue growth, adjusted gross profit for the quarter increased 52% to $3 billion, driven by Celesio and the performance of our other Distribution Solutions businesses. Total adjusted operating expenses of approximately $2 billion were up 61% for the quarter. Excluding the impact of Celesio, operating expenses increased 3% for the quarter. Other income was $13 million during Q3. Interest expense increased 64% versus the prior year to $97 million, driven by debt issued and assumed related to our acquisition of Celesio. Now moving to taxes. This quarter's adjusted tax rate benefited significantly from the R&D and international tax provisions of legislation passed in December 2014, which applied retroactively to the beginning of the calendar year. The resulting benefit of approximately $20 million, in addition to other discrete items, reduced our Q3 tax rate to 28.7%. For the full year, we now expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 31%. Adjusted income from continuing operations for the quarter were $679 million, with our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations at $2.89, up 95% versus the prior year. Excluding Canadian tax reserve adjustments and the technology product realignment and impairment charges taken in the prior year totaling $0.70, our adjusted EPS was up 33%. As I discussed earlier, our adjusted earnings per diluted share this quarter benefited from a lower-than-expected tax rate and from a pull-forward of certain brand price increases from our fiscal fourth quarter into our third quarter. Collectively, these benefits contributed approximately $0.22 to our adjusted earnings from continuing operations per diluted share during the quarter. Wrapping up our consolidated results. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding increased by 1% year-over-year to 236 million. Now let's turn to the segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3A. Distribution Solutions' segment revenues increased for the quarter to $46 billion, up 38% on a reported basis and 39% on a constant-currency basis. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased to $37.4 billion, up 17% on a reported and constant-currency basis. Current quarter revenue growth primarily reflects market growth and our mix of business, including strong growth from existing customers, continued demand for drugs used in the treatment of hepatitis C and the timing of certain generic launches. Driven by these factors, we now expect that for fiscal '15, our North America revenue will grow by a mid-teens percentage over the prior year. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $7.3 billion for the third quarter. On a constant-currency basis, revenues increased 7% on the underlying revenues of Celesio. Medical-Surgical revenues were up 7% for the quarter, driven by market growth, including the incremental benefit of a strong flu season. Distribution Solutions' adjusted gross profit increased 63% for the quarter on 38% revenue growth, resulting in an 87 basis point improvement in our adjusted gross profit margin, driven by our acquisition of Celesio and the market growth. Adjusted operating expense for the segment increased 90% for the quarter, primarily due to our acquisition of Celesio. Excluding Celesio, operating expenses for the segment increased 6% year-over-year. This increase was primarily driven by the strong revenue growth within our North America pharmaceutical distribution and services business during the quarter. The segment-adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 226 basis points, a decline of 8 basis points versus the prior year. This decline was driven by a higher mix of branded drug sales and an adjusted operating profit contribution from Celesio that was lower than we expected. Excluding the impact of Celesio and the hepatitis C drugs, the segment-adjusted operating margin was 248 basis points, an increase of 14 basis points over the prior year. Based on our anticipated mix of revenues, including continued strong demand for hepatitis C drugs and the lower contribution from Celesio, we now expect the full year Distribution Solutions' adjusted operating margin to be down mid-single digit basis points versus the prior year. Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were down 7% for the quarter to $755 million. This decline was primarily driven by the anticipated revenue softness of the Horizon clinical software platform, the planned elimination of a product line and the wind down of our U.K. workforce business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses. For the full year, we now expect revenues to decline by mid-single digits year-over-year, driven by the factors I just mentioned and the impact of some large customers delaying certain contracting decisions due to competing business and regulatory priorities. Adjusted operating expenses in the segment decreased 11%, driven by our restructuring actions. Excluding the impact of charges taken in the prior year, operating expenses declined 8% year-over-year. Third quarter adjusted operating profit for the segment increased 60% to $123 million. Adjusting for the impact of prior year charges, adjusted operating profit increased 3% year-over-year on 7% lower revenues. The segment-adjusted operating margin rate was 16.3%. Adjusting for the impact of prior year charges, the adjusted operating margin was up 167 basis points year-over-year. I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing. In addition, our working capital metrics also include Celesio. For receivables, our days sales outstanding increased 2 days versus the prior year to 26 days. Excluding Celesio, our days sales outstanding remained flat year-over-year. Our days sales in inventories remained flat year-over-year at 31 days. Our days sales in payables increased 5 days year-over-year to 52 days. Excluding Celesio, our days sales in payables increased 6 days to 53 days. We generated $1.2 billion in cash flow from operations during the first 9 months of fiscal 2015. Overall, for the full year, we continue to expect our cash flow from operations to be approximately $3 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $4.6 billion, with $2.2 billion held offshore. Internal capital spending totaled $405 million for the first 9 months of fiscal 2015. We now expect full year internal capital spending to be approximately $525 million versus our initial guidance of $575 million to $625 million. Now I'll turn to our adjusted EPS outlook. Let me once again remind you that our earnings this quarter was specifically impacted by 3 items that also affect our full year outlook. First, we benefited from a lower-than-expected tax rate which allowed us to reduce our full year adjusted tax rate to 31%. Second, the negative foreign currency translation impact to our full year adjusted EPS is now anticipated to be $0.07 versus the $0.04 previously expected. And we have now updated the full year average exchange rate applicable to our adjusted EPS guidance to a rate of $1.29 per euro. Lastly, based on our anticipated mix of revenues, including continued strength and demand for hepatitis C drugs and a lower-than-expected profit contribution from Celesio, we now expect the full year Distribution Solutions' adjusted operating margin to be down mid-single digit basis points versus the prior year. Considering these items and our year-to-date results, we are updating and narrowing our guidance for adjusted earnings from continuing operations to a range of between $10.80 and $10.95 per diluted share. With respect to GAAP earnings per share for the full year, we now expect $1.48 in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and $0.63 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. We also expect to exclude between $0.97 and $1.07 per share in LIFO-related adjustments. Now let me take a few moments to talk about our updated financial statement presentation for the noncontrolling interest in Celesio. At the highest level, we continue to consolidate the financial results of Celesio and we continue to expect that our ownership of Celesio will remain at approximately 76% for the remainder of fiscal 2015. However, as a result of achieving operating control of Celesio in December 2014, some important changes were necessary to appropriately reflect McKesson's obligations to the minority shareholders of Celesio within our financial statements. When we initially gained greater than 75% of Celesio's fully diluted shares during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, you might recall that a line titled Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests was presented below our net income line on Schedule 1, which accompanied our press release. Through the second quarter of fiscal 2015, this line item primarily reflected the minority shareholders' claim to approximately 24% of Celesio's net income. Subsequent to achieving operating control this past December, McKesson now retains 100% of Celesio's net income. In exchange, McKesson is obligated to pay an annual dividend of EUR 0.83 per share to Celesio's minority shareholders. In today's results, this dividend drives approximately $50 million of the Schedule 1 entry for the 9 months ended December 31, under the heading Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests. This $50 million amount addresses our calendar 2014 dividend commitment to Celesio's minority shareholders. Beginning in our fourth quarter and continuing through subsequent fiscal years, this EUR 0.83 dividend will drive a quarterly expense of approximately $12 million, assuming our 76% ownership stake remains unchanged and an exchange rate of $1.15 per euro. Once again, these dividends will be recorded in the line entitled Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests. This change in accounting contributed approximately $0.05 to our adjusted EPS in Q3. We do not expect any material impact to adjusted EPS from the accounting change in Q4. Distribution's segment results as outlined on Schedules 3 and 4 continued to reflect 100% of the results of Celesio. The balance sheet, as reflected on Schedule 5, includes a new caption titled Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests. Subsequent to a pending operating control of Celesio, the carrying value of the noncontrolling interests in Celesio of approximately $1.5 billion were reclassified from equity to redeemable noncontrolling interests. This reclassification was triggered when noncontrolling interests in Celesio became redeemable, allowing put rights held by the minority shareholders to be exercised. As a reminder, these put rights allow minority shareholders to sell their Celesio shares to McKesson at a price of EUR 22.99. In summary, now that we have operating control of Celesio, we recognized 100% of Celesio's net income while owning only 76% of Celesio's outstanding shares. And for this benefit, we are obligated to record annual dividend compensation of EUR 0.83 per share or approximately $12 million per quarter, payable to Celesio's minority shareholders. In addition, our assumptions related to our previously articulated transaction synergies are unchanged. As mentioned by John, by fiscal 2019, we still expect to realize annual synergies between $275 million and $325 million. In summary, we've recorded 3 very solid quarters this year and we are excited to have secured operating control of Celesio. We expect the transaction to deliver tremendous value to our customers, manufacturing partners and shareholders in the years ahead. Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Travis?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.
Glen J. Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: John, I just wanted to follow up on some of James' comments regarding the noncontrolling interest piece of Celesio. So how do you think about it from this point going forward? It seems like a pretty straightforward capital deployment situation. You could either pay up to redeem the remaining piece or you could just let it continue to sit out there and make the dividend payment on a quarterly basis and reallocate that capital elsewhere. So given that you've already guided the market that you would reaccelerate capital deployment in fiscal '16, how do you think about that capital deployment situation from here?
John H. Hammergren: Glen, thanks for the question. I think that you have the basics right. I believe the only thing that's missing in your assumption there is related to their ability to put the shares to us. So we look at it as a source of financing. We know what the put right is, we know what the dividend cost is on an annual basis and we know how much money is tied up related to this obligation. The only difference is that we really can't call those -- that right. We have to have it put against us. But I think just from our perspective, it's a source of financing and there is no longer any P&L or earnings upside by the consolidation of those remaining shares other than a reduction of the dividend, but replaced by whatever are the costs you have associated with the deployment of that capital.
Glen J. Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Maybe if I could just follow up on some of the comments you made in your prepared remark regarding the global procurement office that you opened in London. Could you give us a sense for maybe what types of products we'd be purchasing out of there, or what percentage of your products? Can you do all your generics, branded, OTC? And then, James, how do we start to think about that having an impact on the company's tax rate over time?
John H. Hammergren: Well, to begin with, I think it really is -- we've been focused on the sourcing on a private-label basis in an appropriate tax-efficient way for some time. I think the addition here with this expansion in London is focused primarily on generics and branded drugs, our relationships with the manufacturers and how we plan to go to market. And, James, maybe you can talk a little bit about tax.
James A. Beer: Well, I would just observe that obviously now with a broader worldwide operation, we'll be looking at optimizing our tax position on a global basis, obviously, consistent with all the rules and regulations of each authority in which we're doing business. So I wouldn't want to point to anything in particular emanating out of London.
John H. Hammergren: But, Glen, you did mention OTCs. And I do think that the addition of Lloyds Pharmacy through the acquisition of Celesio does give us a large footprint in OTC products and relationships that would expand beyond our typical branded and generic relationships, albeit that's probably a third leg to put into the strategy. We're going to focus on pharmaceuticals first. I do think there's a way for us to bring our other U.S. customers' and North American customers' demand for OTC products into this discussion at some later date.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: John, I think you talked about the outsized growth coming from a couple of different areas, and one of the ones that you called out was hep C. Yesterday, Gilead came out and said -- or the day before that, came out and said that they would expect that they could see a 25% increase in the number of patients treated based on these new agreements that they've signed with managed care and PBMs. I'm just wondering how this stuff's going to impact your business going forward. Two things. One, would you expect that you would pick up a consistent amount of that market share? And maybe you can help us understand how much of the growth this quarter came from hep C? And then secondly, maybe if you could just help us to think about the margins around hep C and any other of these more expensive specialty drugs that are coming to market.
John H. Hammergren: Thanks, Lisa, for the question. It's probably difficult for us to comment specifically on the number of patients that are not being served from a hep C perspective, and certainly some of the market share changes that might be forecast between the various manufacturers related to the market. This business for us is primarily government-related and mail order. So that we have a -- as you know, with our relationships both in mail and with the VA and the DoD, we have a heavy concentration of products in those markets and clearly, hep C is one of those products. The product is -- the hep C products are dilutive to our overall margins. And so from a revenue perspective, they're very positive from a growth perspective but they are not all that helpful on the bottom line. And I'd say that we -- our growth this quarter was certainly impacted by hep C but I might also say, we think we grew well in excess of market growth rates through our expanded relationships with our existing customers and the strength we've had in expanding things like generics into Rite Aid and the pull-through of generics in our other customer bases. So I think that we are feeling pretty good about the momentum we have in our base of business.
James A. Beer: And, in fact, if I could just add, an example of that growth is in our OneStop program, where even aside from the growth that Rite Aid represented in OneStop, we still, in addition, grew OneStop 20% year-over-year. Specifically to the revenue contribution of the hepatitis C drugs, they drove about 4 points of the 17% growth that we saw in Q3 year-over-year. And as we're alluding to here, they're 1 of the 2 drivers, along with the Celesio contribution, that were driving our commentary around Distribution Solutions' margins in Q3 and for the full year.
Operator: We'll take our next question from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.
George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I guess, John, I kind of noticed that absent from the commentary of this call was kind of the thoughts on generic drug price inflation and 2 of your peers have kind of talked about moderating generic drug price inflation. I thought you might give us an update on what McKesson is seeing.
John H. Hammergren: Our view on generic price inflation is basically in line with how we viewed the year as we came into the year. We said that we felt it was going to be generally flat with last year, perhaps slightly down compared to prior year. And I think our view has remained consistent and remains consistent as we think about what we've accomplished in the first 3 quarters and what we have in front of us. I would say it's difficult perhaps to compare the commentary between those in the industry because all of us look at generic price inflation, we define it differently, first; and then secondly, we all have different books of business with different manufacturers and have probably different exposure to all of this. So I would say that our quarter results in Q3 and what we're talking about for the rest of the year is pretty much in line with our expectations when we started the year.
George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And maybe a quick follow-up on Celesio. I'm going to assume that there were no Celesio synergies delivered in the quarter and you guys are sticking to your guidance on the procurement synergies. I guess at what point kind of in the process of the acquisition will you be ready to talk about operating synergies as opposed to procurement synergies?
John H. Hammergren: Well, you're right. There really were no synergies in our results for the quarter related to Celesio. I mean we just achieved operating control, which allows us to go as a unified body to the marketplace, which this London operation is beginning to do, has begun to do in January and is continuing throughout the rest of this quarter. So the $275 million to $325 million has yet to be executed on, particularly from a product perspective. Now some of the tax savings that we forecasted there should begin to flow more quickly than the products side of it. As it relates to operating synergies, we have a bit of a path here to get the organization to where we think it can be operationally. And clearly, one of the big things we need to do is invest in the IT infrastructure that's necessary to help Celesio realize the advantage of scale and to be more productive in the operation. We have some work underway to help them optimize certain functions in terms of distribution and transportation. We're working on those initiatives. But clearly, it's probably too early to forecast any operating synergies related to Celesio as we think about the remainder of this year.
James A. Beer: And I would expect that those items that John was just mentioning to be one of the drivers of our capital spending each year.
John H. Hammergren: And in fact, to some extent, George, the synergy from an operating perspective in the early phases may be more of a dis-synergy as we invest more heavily than we get returns on in the early phases. And so we'll probably see actually a little more expense. Now clearly, the upside from this acquisition wasn't in significant operating synergy in the near term in Celesio. It was really about accomplishing our sourcing and procurement synergies. And we have no reason to believe that we won't be successful on that objective. And I think that, that is a first priority. The second priority is what do we do to assist Celesio in its operations. In the near term, that's probably more of an investment expense slash phase than it is a synergy that we deliver to the bottom line phase. So we're focused on doing both.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: John, you spent some time in the prepared remarks talking about the specialty business and the opportunities there. Can you help us quantify what percent of the 17% top line growth came from specialty? And I'm assuming that specialty segment is excluding the HCV benefit. And what are the specific areas within specialty that you're seeing most growth from? And then I have another follow-up.
John H. Hammergren: Well, I mean, our specialty business, once again, it's similar to the other themes in this conversation. Probably each person participating in the industry may define specialty differently. When we talk about specialty, we're not talking about hepatitis C drugs or some of the things that have impacted our revenues in such a significant way. What we're talking about are primarily oncology products and some of the other -ologies like rheumatology and ophthalmology. From a growth perspective, we have some of those other specialty areas growing more rapidly than oncology, but it's off of a very small base. Oncology continues to be the main driver of our performance in specialty, and our bullish remarks regarding our growth in specialty is driven by our success in the oncology portfolio of our business, on a combined basis: Both the work we're doing on the network to grow the number of physicians in US Oncology; in our distribution platform out to oncology and other specialties; and clearly in some of the work that we're doing with manufacturers on the clinical services, and the data work that we're doing, really is all-encompassing. But we're pleased with the progress we're making in specialty, and it's an important part of our continued performance.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then just one follow-up on the Rite Aid, which you talked about the contribution to OneStop. I mean, obviously, Rite Aid very publicly attributed their improved outlook to their expanded relationship with McKesson. Is kind of the proof of concept that we're seeing in Rite Aid starting to resonate with some of your other large retail clients that are not buying the bulk of their generics from you?
John H. Hammergren: Well, we certainly think so. And I think the best example would be the success in our relationship with Omnicare, and not only renewing that partnership, but getting them to work with us and source through us their generic portfolio. I think Rite Aid played a role in that as a great reference point relative to our success. And I think as Rite Aid and others continue to say McKesson is the best alternative, frankly, along with other industry players that are beginning to turn to wholesaling as the source of product that they otherwise would have purchased direct, I think is a continued reinforcement of the power that wholesaling brings to the industry, both in terms of our purchasing and sourcing capabilities, but also frankly, our ability to use capital efficiently and our logistics expertise. And so there are several benefits why customers -- McKesson customers are turning to us and saying that we'd like to expand our existing relationship beyond brands into the generic portfolio. And we're optimistic about that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: John, I just wanted to go back to the comments around the pull-forward you saw this quarter. And I feel like we've heard this from time to time from you and your competitors. I mean, is this just seeing pricing coming in ahead of your internal expectations? Or is it actually something more contractual?
John H. Hammergren: Well, once again, I can't speak for the industry or our competitors. But related to McKesson's work with manufacturers, particularly those that we have a contractual relationship with, we have great visibility to the amount of income we might earn from those relationships over time. The methods by which we earn that income and the timing is not always easy for us to forecast. And that's why we don't frankly provide quarterly guidance because we're not necessarily always certain about when those price increases might fall. And that was really what we were speaking about here relative to the pull-forward. We know the total amount we're going to get and then we know if we get a bunch of it in the third quarter, that it's not going to come again in the fourth quarter. And clearly, there's a portion of our income with branded manufacturers that's still earned outside of these relationships. But I would say that the large portion of what we realized here is -- was totally visible to us and is just a movement from one quarter to the next.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. That answers the question. And then I guess, just the follow-up I have was around biosimilars. That's something the industry has been talking about for years. Now it seems like we have a feel on the near-term horizon with Remicade and Neupogen. Can you maybe just remind us how you see the economics playing out for McKesson? Is your expectation that as we see biosimilars, and these 2 specifically, come to the market, that the wholesalers will be able to leverage their value? Or could these maybe end up looking more similar to additional branded launches?
John H. Hammergren: Well, I think it's difficult to -- once again, to make sort of an industry call. I do think that McKesson's position is unique as it relates particularly to cancer drugs, given our position with US Oncology and our network. We obviously don't own those physicians but we do partner closely with them. And as I discussed in my prepared remarks, our understanding of the clinical work that's necessary to bring a branded drug to market and take it to the various phases of clinical trial should be helpful as people begin to prove that the biosimilars have an equivalent outcome for the patient as the product that it might be replacing. And so I think that, that resource is unique to McKesson, and I do think our ability to use that resource to build value for the manufacturers that are entering this space will be helpful for us. It's probably too early to quantify when and what might occur as a result of this. I just wanted to point out the differentiation that we bring to the business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with UBS.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I guess kind of looking back through time. The McKesson fiscal fourth quarter EPS results have been up sequentially versus fiscal 3Q, like every year for the past 8 years or so, potentially even further back from that, except for the fact that my model doesn't go back, so I can't analyze it further on the fly. But really the question is, I guess, is the pull-forward of the brand inflation economics really that material to drive this unique cadence this fiscal year? Or again, maybe I missed it, were there 1 or 2 other big factors that might be driving the EPS down sequentially besides just that brand inflation? I know you mentioned a little bit about Celesio profits staying a little bit lower. But I just want to make sure I didn't miss any other key variables there.
James A. Beer: Yes. I think it is a little bit more complicated this Q4 sequentially. We have this branded pull-forward item that John has just been discussing. We also have the tax rate effect between Q3, which was particularly low, and Q4. And then, of course, we also have a little bit higher FX headwind than we were expecting 90 days ago when we were on the call. And then we've also given you something of a sense around both of the DS margins and how they would be driving relative to this quite high DS revenue growth. And then we've also given you a sense of the TS revenue situation as well for the full year. So I think those are really the key drivers that will be relevant for us in Q4 and drive the sequential pattern that you're referring to.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Eric Percher with Barclays.
Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So given that you have operational control and you're expecting $1.8 billion in cash flow in the coming quarter, James, could you help us understand, are there any barriers from preventing you from reaccelerating putting cash to work? And how do you think about the minimum cash balance? Do you consider the noncontrolling interest? I know last quarter, you mentioned debt maturities. And I imagine there's a chance you could end up with a inefficient balance sheet given that noncontrolling interest could extend for a long period of time. And I know you have the ability to refinance and grow via -- or de-lever via EBITDA growth. So how do you account for those items?
James A. Beer: Yes well, you're right in that we certainly have to be ready for those minority Celesio shareholders to put their shares to us. So I talked a lot on the call about the accounting, but in terms of usage of cash, we have to be ready for them to put their shares to us. And directionally, that's an amount of money of the order of $1.5 billion. And then also, as you mentioned in your question, we have debt maturities in fiscal '16 that will be appreciably larger than what we've seen in recent years, so again, about $1.5 billion coming due in fiscal '16. All of that said -- and certainly, there's a clear commitment to our ongoing investment-grade credit ratings here, all of that said, there's no change philosophically from the portfolio approach to capital allocation that McKesson has had for many years. And that portfolio is internal capital expenditure, M&A, dividends and share buybacks. And we do certainly want to emphasize the internal CapEx and the M&A as ways in which we can potentially drive further cash flow growth in the years that we think will be valuable to our shareholders. Certainly, in the 1.25 years that I've been here, I've been impressed as I've inspected the long-term track record of McKesson's M&A. I think McKesson has a terrific record around driving value through M&A. And so we'd want to have some capacity to enter into M&A should attractive opportunities come along, while we're in this de-levering period.
Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And do you view de-levering as it must come via a reduction in the debt level? Or will growth in EBITDA play a role?
James A. Beer: Well, I think it will be both. I think it will be us paying down maturities, as well as consistent growth in EBITDA in the coming years.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: John or James, do you expect Celesio here to grow sequentially from this point? And what actually did drive the slightly lower profits for the business this past quarter?
John H. Hammergren: Well, I think that the -- Celesio's a tale of many different markets. And so I think that depending on the market and whether we're talking about wholesaling or retailing, we do obviously expect growth in our businesses at market levels or above. There are certain markets like Brazil and France that we are a little more uncertain of relative to what kind of growth we're going to expect and certainly in France, given some of the reimbursement pressures that they face. Germany's been a troubled business for us, but we do see some signs of stability there and good growth from a revenue perspective. And clearly, the U.K., on both wholesale and retailing, has been a very positive story for us. So -- and I guess, we were pleased with the growth that Celesio's delivered from a revenue perspective this quarter and I think we would expect that business to continue to grow at or above market levels. And from a market perspective, James?
James A. Beer: Well, I was just going to add, our experience thus far in fiscal '15 has been a stronger first half than a second half. And while we're only just really still in the middle of our FY '16 planning exercise, directionally, I wouldn't be surprised to see that continuing into the future.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And just margin-wise, just various challenges across various markets but nothing specific?
James A. Beer: Well, I think the margin side of Celesio will be driven by the experience of Brazil and France in particular. Again, the U.K., we're seeing strong performance and we're somewhat encouraged by the situation in Germany that seems to be seeing some stability.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Well Robert just knocked off my question so I'll just ask a separate one that's of lesser importance. But, John, you mentioned -- you always like to mention a small business in the company that's doing well. And this time, you spent a little extra time in prepared remarks talking about US Oncology and the CRO services businesses. I'm curious if there was anything specific around that, that drove the additional attention this time related to the market or areas where you're investing and things of that sort? And I appreciate it.
John H. Hammergren: Well, I think you're -- the question is a good one. Our focus really is not material from a financial perspective on what we do on the CRO business related to what we get paid to do those clinical trials. It's probably more relevant, our position with the manufacturers and the import that we have in the network to those manufacturers relative to working with them about products, particularly early in the community-oncology space. I would say that there's a lot more clinical trial work done obviously in these big universities settings when they can go to a single enterprise to get a bunch of work done. But there's really no other aggregation of community oncologists where they're going to have a single enterprise approach and pick up so many different markets and so many different types of doctors. So I think that we're heavily focused on making sure that in the portfolio of things we do for manufacturers in all of our businesses, that we continue to add value in a significant way and find ways to differentiate what we do.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI, Research Division: So I just wanted to quickly touch on the Tech Solutions business. It's been a sort of long winding road the last few years. And obviously, you've made a number of decisions to kind of restructure and revamp the business. As we're sort of exiting the year, I'm looking for more qualitative not quantitative, but how do you feel like the portfolio now is kind of taking shape? And I guess as you think about areas to either strengthen or whether or not there's even anything left that's small, left to sort of maybe not divest but deemphasize, how do you feel like you need to kind of continue evolve that asset to be a sort of net contributor to the business on an EBIT growth basis going forward?
John H. Hammergren: Well, we're pleased with the performance of that business, it's basically in line with what we had anticipated this year, given that we had talked about that we were going to and have prepared the portfolio to focus on those businesses where we felt we had an opportunity to grow. And in particular, took out a business or 2 that produced no earnings. And part of what you've seen is great margin expansion as a result of that focus and attention. The businesses that are performing well there are businesses that we've had for a long time and that are continuing to modify their models so we can create a recurring revenue stream. And I would say the businesses that are flat or struggling are those that have either been replaced in the market with other priorities that people are spending on, other things that they have to buy and not buy some of our products that they'll have to come back around to later, or businesses where a transition's underway from a technology perspective. So I think we are still in middle of the game relative to the transition between Horizon and Paragon, which will be ongoing, which is a bit of a headwind as we think going forward. But we're also trying to invest in front of what we think will be a buy cycle for products that will help customers understand data better to make better decisions to take on risk and to follow the patient in a more longitudinal way. So there's a bunch of interesting places that we're placing bets, including CommonWell Health, that we think will pay off. But generally steady as she goes is the way we think about it at this point.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Maybe if I can jump onto Ross' question a little bit, expand if you could, John. If we were to look at this business a few years out from now, I know in the past and today as well, you talk about some of the strengths, particularly interoperability and RelayHealth -- the assets that were RelayHealth. What do you think the mix of this business will look like? And as you kind of wind down some of the other legacy businesses, how much longer do you think that will take for you?
John H. Hammergren: Well I think that it's -- the question is difficult to answer given the prioritization our customers place on some of these activities. An example would be the significant amount of business we have in the payer space and our ability to focus our customers on spending against the next opportunity to optimize their performance as opposed to spending against issues that they have to deal with either from a regulatory perspective or a security perspective, et cetera. So our customers' priorities sometimes don't necessarily match where we're well positioned from a product portfolio perspective. I would say though that as you think out 2 or 3 years, the EMR space and the transition away from Horizon will be more complete or complete, and we'll see more results, we think, in terms of this pay-for-performance priority. I mentioned that HHS and others believe that the market has to move more towards a value-based reimbursement methodology. That's going to require additional investment.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: And is that coming from sort of more through the trained up spaces, really from your payer solutions business, as well as sort of the RelayHealth business?
John H. Hammergren: Well I think we're well positioned in the connectivity spaces because those transactions are already flowing through our businesses and those transactions are well underway and we are helping our customers do things more efficiently with more knowledge as a result of connectivity and interoperability. I think it's the places where folks can delay their purchasing decisions that we experience the volatility in our base. And most of our businesses today that are ahead of plan are ahead of plan because of volumes related to transactions. And most of the businesses that are behind their plans in our technology suite are behind not because customers have chosen somebody else's solution, they're behind because the buy decision has been delayed because there's other priorities for the customer, either from a capital deployment perspective or other priorities from a workload perspective for their IT groups to focus on other things other than buying a piece of software that might have a great return but they just don't have the ability to do it given that the priorities are someplace else. So I think that that's why this business is a little bit difficult to forecast because of some of those nuances that don't frankly exist in our distribution businesses where, unless you lose a large customer, you can count on the volume being there the next year, and it's just a question of maintaining that satisfaction level of the customers to continue to grow the business.
Operator: Our last question today comes from Garen Sarafian with Citi Research.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: The first question was a quick follow-up bringing it back to procurement. I know it's only been a short while since obtaining operational control. But knowing Paul and his team, I suspect they've already had a healthy dose of meetings with the manufacturer. So could you give us any specifics as to the progress you've made there and maybe some broad strokes as to how the conversations are going? And maybe even if and how you shifted your approach to the market as you're receiving early feedback?
John H. Hammergren: Well, we are very early in this process. We couldn't really begin this dialogue until we had operational control. That didn't happen until middle of December. And I would say that our early conversations with manufacturers have been very positive, and we've made very nice progress. And I think most of the manufacturers in the world have an interest in having a dialogue with McKesson because of the value that we bring and the customers that have entrusted us with their business and their volumes to go to the marketplace in a unified way. So I do feel positive about where we're headed. I think it's early to try to quantify timing or value. But I think from a first-step perspective, we're on track with where we thought we would be at this point post-domination.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Fair enough. I had to try on that one. And then just a quick follow-up. James, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned in the Technology segment that there were some larger client delays due to competing projects, I believe it was. So could you elaborate on that a little bit? And what gives you confidence that it'll come back?
James A. Beer: Yes. It's really just what John was expanding on in one of his last comments there. We have seen in some of the technology businesses a delay in some of the bookings that we continue to expect to come through. But from the customers' perspective, it's a bit of a sequencing, a bit of a prioritization issue. So yes, I would expect to get that business. It's just a matter of precisely when.
John H. Hammergren: Well. Thank you, operator, and thank you, all, for being on the call today and for your time. I'm pleased with our solid results in the third quarter, and I'm excited about the opportunities we see across our business to deliver exceptional value to our customers. I'm now going to hand the call back to Erin for her review of upcoming events for the financial community. Erin?
Erin Lampert: Thank you, John. On March 3, we will present at the Cowen Healthcare Conference in Boston, and we will release fourth quarter earnings results in May. Thank you and goodbye.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the McKesson Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Erin Lampert: Thank you, Melissa. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson's Fiscal 2015 Second Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update and will then introduce James, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after 1 hour at 6 p.m. Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and LIFO-related adjustments. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for our investors. Please refer to our press release announcing second quarter fiscal 2015 results available on our website for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thanks. And here's John Hammergren.
John H. Hammergren: Thanks, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Today, we reported solid results for our second quarter with total company revenues of $44.8 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.79. We've seen strong execution across all of our businesses, and I'm pleased with the great performance of our team in the first half of the fiscal year. We remain confident in our outlook for the full year and we continue to expect adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $10.50 to $10.90 for fiscal 2015. Before I begin my comments on our business performance for the quarter, I want to provide a brief update on our acquisition of Celesio. Currently -- excuse me, approximately, 1 year ago, we announced our intention to acquire Celesio, the former global leader in health care services, by bringing together the strengths and expertise of 2 companies with complementary geographic footprints, shared values and common histories as trusted partners to our customers. The next important milestone in bringing together our 2 companies is the registration of the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement with a relevant German court, which we continue to expect by the end of calendar 2014. The registration of this agreement will effectively allow McKesson and Celesio to begin our cooperative work to develop and deliver the synergy case we have outlined, where we expect to achieve 277 -- $275 million to $325 million in annual synergies by the fourth year following the registration of the domination agreement. We remain excited about the opportunities ahead of us to continue to lead in an increasingly global pharmaceutical supply chain and to enhance our customer's ability to deliver better and more efficient health care services. Moving now to our business results for the quarter. Distribution Solutions had strong results in the second quarter with revenues of $44 billion, up 37%, and adjusted operating profit of $1.1 billion, up 29% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Based on the strong revenue trends we have seen year-to-date, we now believe full year revenue growth in North America will be in the low double digits, driven primarily by strong demand for recently launched drugs for the treatment of hepatitis C and the timing of certain generic launches, which will come later than we had originally planned. We also now expect adjusted operating margin for the Distribution Solutions segment to be flat to modestly up year-over-year, driven primarily by our expectation they will have a much stronger mix of branded pharmaceutical business in fiscal 2015 compared to our original plan, specifically driven by the higher-than-anticipated revenue from hepatitis C drugs and the delay in certain generic launches. Our updated full year outlook for Distribution Solutions operating margin also includes an assumption that margin in our international pharmaceutical distribution and services business will come down modestly from the prior year. North American distribution and services, which includes our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, McKesson Specialty Health and McKesson Canada, delivered strong results for the second quarter. Within North America, revenue growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business exceeded our expectations in the second quarter, driven by the continued strength and demand for 2 recently launched drugs for the treatment of hepatitis C as well as solid growth across our hospital, national retail and independent customers. Our U.S. Pharmaceutical business continues to innovate and expand the boundaries of operational excellence in everything we do for our customers and our manufacturing partners. We perform an essential and valued service for our branded manufacturing partners and continue to earn steady levels of compensation in return. We also benefit from the growth across our portfolio of generic pharmaceuticals, where we are extremely well positioned with our customer-focused proprietary programs and the value we provide across our extensive generic offerings. We continue to see strong growth in our proprietary OneStop Generics program as a growing number of our customers benefit from the strength and scale of McKesson's sourcing expertise. An important addition to our OneStop program in the first half of the fiscal year has been the volume associated with Rite Aid. I'm very pleased to report that during the quarter, we completed the operational transition associated with the implementation of our expanded agreement with Rite Aid, which we first announced back in February. I want to recognize the outstanding efforts of our U.S. Pharmaceutical team and the team at Rite Aid for successfully completing the transition, with a clear focus on ensuring great service through Rite Aid stores. McKesson's direct-to-store deliveries to all of Rite Aid's more than 4,500 stores helps to ensure operational efficiencies, excellent service levels and improved product availability for Rite Aid's customers. Our expanded agreement with Rite Aid is delivering the savings envisioned by both organizations by driving additional efficiencies in the distribution and sourcing of pharmaceutical products and the significant savings associated with improved working capital utilization. Our team does an outstanding job day-in and day-out by aligning our interests with our customers' interests, and we know that their success is our success. The strength, skill and scale of McKesson's global procurement team ensures we are providing our customers with the results that are better than they would have achieved on their own, with the highest levels of product quality and availability. By working together with our customers, we are able to truly create a winning formula that delivers savings and efficiencies in the delivery of pharmaceutical products. In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business in the second quarter and the outstanding results we have delivered in the first half of the fiscal year. Turning now to our Specialty business. We had another quarter of solid results and we continue to see strong growth across the business. I'm pleased with the growth in our oncology business, where we are focused on delivering the highest-quality cancer care in a payment model that rewards value. And we continue to see growth in our other specialties, such as ophthalmology and rheumatology, where we believe we can leverage our distribution and sourcing expertise along with our technology assets to help ensure specialist physicians continue to grow their practices and deliver high-quality care to their patients. And our Canadian business had another solid quarter with the results that were in line with our expectations. We continue to grow our Canadian business through our focus on operational excellence, ensuring we have an optimized and efficient distribution infrastructure in place, investing in important and growing markets, such as Specialty Services and Distribution, and growing our presence in private label generics in the Canadian market. Turning now to our results for international pharmaceutical distribution and services. Revenues for the second quarter were $7.3 billion, an increase of 4% on the underlying results of Celesio on a constant currency basis. As you may have seen in Celesio's results announced this morning, we continue to expect revenue to increase modestly year-over-year on the underlying results of Celesio and now expect a modest decline in operating profit year-over-year, driven by market pressure in Germany, France and Brazil, partially offset by continued strong performance in our U.K. businesses. Turning to our Medical-Surgical business. Revenues were $1.5 billion for the first quarter, an increase of 4% over the prior year. Our Medical-Surgical team continues to do an excellent job with the integration of PSS, bringing together and optimizing the sales, distribution and information systems platforms within the business. Integration and our pursuit of synergies from the acquisition remain on schedule and in line with our expectations. Critical to our success to date has been the significant progress we have made in our integration efforts while maintaining strong momentum with our customers. We continue to make great strides leveraging the best sales force in the industry to serve our customers and drive strong performance in our customer service and satisfaction across the expanded customer base. In summary, I am pleased with the strong second quarter results in Distribution Solutions. Technology Solutions' revenues were down 6% for the second quarter, driven primarily by anticipated revenue softness in our Horizon Clinicals software platform and the disposition of a product line as contemplated in the original guidance we provided for fiscal 2015. Adjusted operating margin in this segment was 18% in the quarter, primarily due to favorable revenue mix and timing. For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted operating margin in the mid-teens for the Technology Solutions segment. I'm pleased with the progress we've made in our Technology Solutions portfolio and the year-to-date improvement we've seen in the core operating margin profile of this segment. Last quarter, I provided an update on the CommonWell Health Alliance, where McKesson and the other members are pioneering solutions to lead our industry in addressing the issue of data interoperability, to make health information available to the providers who need it when they need it, regardless of where the care occurred. I continue to be encouraged by the Alliance's ability to demonstrate real-world progress, including the continued addition of new members across the health care ecosystem, successful pilots in 4 geographies, demonstrating real-world data exchanges across disparate systems and most recently, a multiyear agreement for nationwide commercialization of the services, with the core services being provided by RelayHealth. At McKesson, we are committed to improving health care through data interoperability. Our systems are built on open, contemporary architectures that are low-cost and easy to implement for our customers. The CommonWell Health Alliance members join us in making data available to providers in their current systems, expanding down their current investments without having to replace their existing systems. As McKesson and other CommonWell members now look to drive nationwide deployment and expansion, we continue to encourage other organizations to help lead our industry and our country in moving the information between platforms to enable better patient care. In summary, we will continue to focus on our key strategic priorities for Technology Solutions: including helping our customers reduce cost and operate more efficiently; providing our customers with solutions to drive improved analytics; and supporting our customer's transformation to a world of value-based care. Now to wrap up my comments for fiscal Q2. I'm pleased with our results for the second quarter and the strong execution across all of our businesses in the first half of the fiscal year. We remain confident in our outlook for the full year, and we continue to expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $10.50 to $10.90 for fiscal 2015. In addition to the strength of our operating performance, we continue to have a strong balance sheet. For the first half of the fiscal year, we've generated cash flow from operations of $165 million, and our expectation to deliver cash flow from operations of approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2015 remains unchanged from our original guidance. With that, I'll turn the call over to James, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?
James A. Beer: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased with our second quarter results and our performance in the first half of fiscal 2015. Before reviewing our second quarter results, I'd like to address a request from some of our investors related to the impact of foreign currency rate movements on our results. As you might recall in our original guidance for fiscal 2015, we assumed an exchange rate of $1.36 per euro for the full year. For the first half of the year, the average exchange rate was in line with this assumption and thus, foreign exchange did not have a material impact on either our first or second quarter results. However, given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we are now assuming an average exchange rate during the second half of our fiscal 2015 of $1.27 per euro. This would drive a full year average exchange rate of $1.31 per euro. This equates to a negative foreign currency translation impact of approximately $0.04, net of the Celesio noncontrolling interest, during the back half of our fiscal year. However, as John mentioned, we are maintaining our full year outlook for adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $10.50 to $10.90 per diluted share. Now let's move to our results for the second quarter. My remarks today will focus on our second quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $2.79, which excludes 3 items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles; acquisition expenses and related adjustments; and LIFO-related adjustments. Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedule 2A. Consolidated revenues increased 36% for the quarter to $44.8 billion. On this 36% revenue growth, adjusted gross profit for the quarter increased 46% to $3 billion, driven by Celesio and the strong performance of our other Distribution Solutions businesses. Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.9 billion were up 59% for the quarter. Excluding the impact of Celesio, operating expenses increased 1% for the quarter. Other income was $23 million during Q2. Interest expense increased 68% versus the prior year to $99 million, driven by debts issued and assumed related to our acquisition of Celesio. Now moving to taxes. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 32%. As usual, I would expect this tax rate to fluctuate somewhat from quarter-to-quarter. As a reminder, we still expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 31.5%. Adjusted income from continuing operations for the quarter was $658 million, with our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations at $2.79. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding increased by 1% year-over-year to 235 million. Now let's turn to the segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3A. Distribution Solutions' segment revenues increased for the quarter to $44 billion, up 37% on a reported and constant currency basis. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 14% to $35.1 billion. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 15%. Current quarter revenue growth primarily reflects higher-than-expected demand for Sovaldi and Olysio, 2 recently launched drugs for the treatment of hepatitis C, market growth and our overall mix of business. For the year, we are forecasting higher-than-planned branded drug sales, which reflect our strong market demand for the 2 hepatitis C drugs and delays in certain generic launches, including Nexium and COPAXONE. As a result, we now expect that our North America revenue will increase by a low double-digit percentage for the full fiscal year. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $7.3 billion for the second quarter. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 4% on the underlying revenues of Celesio. Medical-Surgical revenues were up 4% for the quarter, driven by market growth. Distribution Solutions' adjusted gross profit increased 58% for the quarter on a 37% revenue growth, resulting in an 80 basis point improvement in our adjusted gross profit margin, driven by our acquisition of Celesio and market growth. Adjusted operating expense for the segment increased 88% for the quarter due to our acquisition of Celesio. Excluding Celesio, operating expenses for the segment increased 4% year-over-year. The segment-adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 242 basis points, a decline of 15 basis points versus the prior year, driven by a higher mix of branded drug sales, including the effect of the hepatitis C drugs and the brand to generic delays that I just mentioned. Excluding the impact of both hepatitis C drugs, segment-adjusted operating margin was approximately 250 basis points for the current quarter. As a reminder, for the full year, our expectations for branded and generic drug price inflation remain unchanged, although we expect some variability in the impact of pharmaceutical prices from quarter-to-quarter. Based on the impact of the 2 hepatitis C drugs and the delayed generic launches as well as our assumption that operating profit in our international pharmaceutical distribution and services business will be down modestly year-over-year, we now expect full year Distribution Solutions' adjusted operating margin to be flat to modestly up over the prior year. Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were down 6% for the quarter to $770 million. This decline was primarily driven by the anticipated revenue softness of the Horizon Clinical software platform, the planned elimination of a product line and the wind-down of our U.K. workforce business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses. Adjusted operating expenses in the segment decreased 5%, driven primarily by restructuring actions taken in the prior year. Despite the anticipated decline in segment revenues, second quarter adjusted operating profit for the segment was flat at $139 million. And the adjusted operating margin rate was approximately 18%, representing an increase of 102 basis points versus the prior year. This increase was based on a favorable revenue mix in the second quarter as well as the effect of reduced expenses. I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. In addition, our working capital metrics also include Celesio. For receivables, our days sales outstanding increased 2 days versus the prior year. Excluding Celesio, our days sales outstanding remained flat at 24 days. Our days sales in inventories were flat year-over-year at 30 days. Our days sales in payables increased by 1 day year-over-year to 49 days. Excluding Celesio, our days sales in payables increased 3 days to 51 days. We generated $165 million in cash flow from operations during the first 6 months of fiscal 2015. Overall, for the full year, we continue to expect our cash flow from operations to be approximately $3 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.8 billion, with $2.1 billion held offshore. Internal capital spending was $272 million for the first half of fiscal '15. Now I'll turn to our adjusted EPS outlook for the year. As I mentioned earlier, our fiscal 2015 guidance for adjusted earnings from continuing operations per diluted share of $10.50 to $10.90 is unchanged but now assumes a second half $1.27 per euro exchange rate. Before I conclude, I will make a few remarks regarding our acquisition of Celesio. As John mentioned, we continue to expect that we will achieve operating control of Celesio by the end of calendar 2014. By the fourth year after obtaining operating control, we continue to expect to realize annual synergies between $275 million and $325 million. And finally, with respect to our expected GAAP earnings per share for the full year, we now expect $1.32 per share in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and $0.57 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. We also expect to exclude between $0.97 and $1.07 per share in LIFO-related adjustments. In summary, McKesson delivered strong financial results during the first half of fiscal 2015, and we are well positioned for the second half of our fiscal year. Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Melissa?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: John, can you maybe just talk about drug price inflation in the quarter on the Generics side? The last few quarters, it's been pretty strong, but I didn't hear you specifically call it out in this quarter. Is there anything that's changed?
John H. Hammergren: As we chatted on the first quarter, we believe that some of our second quarter inflation was pulled slightly ahead into the first quarter. Our outlook for the year remains unchanged, down slightly from the inflation rates we experienced last year but still pretty robust. So the second quarter came in line with exactly where we thought it would be when we finished the first quarter comments.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then James, just a numbers question. If I listen to what you said around the delay in Nexium, COPAXONE and the foreign currency, am I right thinking that versus your initial expectations that those things combined are somewhere in the neighborhood of a $0.10 headwind versus the initial guidance that you gave us?
James A. Beer: Well, in terms of the initial guide, certainly -- obviously, we're reaffirming the guide that we've outlined earlier in the year so we feel very comfortable with the range. We have been surprised by the strength of the hepatitis C volumes. And they come along with lower margins, as I intimated. Without those 2 hepatitis C drugs, our margin would have been right around the 250 basis point level for Distribution Solutions. So hopefully, that gives you some sense as to the impact of those hepatitis C drugs on our quarter. So that was really an important driver, but overall, we still feel good about the guide even though we have the $0.04 currency headwind that I mentioned as well.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Right. As well as the delay in the Generics, right?
James A. Beer: Yes.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So the combination of those, that's an incremental headwind to what we would have expected post last quarter?
James A. Beer: Yes, that's right. So we referred to generally strength in branded pharmaceutical sales in terms of the mix. And those delays of products like Nexium and COPAXONE are important drivers within that theme.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Percher with Barclays.
Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Could you speak to the way that you're looking at the noncontrolling interest and your willingness to put cash to work as long as the noncontrolling interest is outstanding? I guess more specifically, do you think that your minimum cash balance, as long as the interest is out, has to encapsulate it? Does it need to be $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion-plus, whatever it takes to run the business. Or if this looks like it's going to go on for a long period, would you consider using the cash that is offshore?
James A. Beer: Well, in terms of capital allocation, we obviously have to be mindful of the noncontrolling interest that you're mentioning there. Also, we have to be focused on the larger debt maturities that we have coming due in fiscal '16, where the maturities move to the $1.5 billion type level, whereas this year, debt maturities have just been a couple of hundred million dollars in total. So those are important things to bear in mind. But having said that, nothing has changed in terms of our overall portfolio thinking towards capital allocation. And historically, that has meant a balance between M&A, internal capital expenditures as well as share buybacks and dividends. So that's how we're really thinking about cash and the capital allocation equation.
John H. Hammergren: I also think, Eric, it's difficult to forecast when the minority interest or noncontrolling interest purchase would take place. And I think that's one of the other challenges is it may not be 100% in our control, given that they have the ability to put those shares to us.
Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Sure. So -- but it sounds like you're still approaching the noncontrolling interest as you would any capital allocation decision? Or is there a strategic need to own it?
James A. Beer: Well, again, those minority holders have the right to put their shares to us or we would continue to pay them a defined annual dividend. So this equation is very much in their hands.
Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Right. But you don't feel the need to chase that?
James A. Beer: Well, as we've said for our full year guidance -- fiscal '15, we're assuming 76% is going to be our ownership level for Celesio. And again, the core process defined through our independent evaluation are the rights for the minority.
John H. Hammergren: And also, I would remind the listeners that the operating -- operational control process that we're pursuing, that we believe will be completed by the end of the year, is not affected by the ownership position of the company. Once we surpass the 75% ownership position, it allowed us to pursue this activity, which will give us the ability to begin to realize the synergies that we've outlined. And so I -- they are 2 separate and distinct discussions: one is operational control, which is the process that's underway; and the second is the ownership -- the remaining ownership of the 24% that is not currently held by McKesson. And to affect operational control, we do not need to buy any of the additional outstanding shares.
Operator: Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: John, can you give us a little bit more color on kind of like your thoughts about -- on the European market dynamics in line of the Celesio-revised guidance and your comments on the 3 geographies in Europe and how that compares to kind of like your thought when you provided guidance and entered a transaction?
John H. Hammergren: Well, clearly, the Celesio management team has a responsibility to comment on their results, and I think they did so this morning. I think stepping away from Celesio specifically and looking at the markets, clearly, there is continued price pressure in Germany, in the wholesaler side of the business, and which I think the industry has been talking about for some time. Clearly, the French economy has not performed at the level that some would have had expected. And there's additional pressure in that market. And Brazil has been a challenge for many of the companies that are competing in the Brazilian market. I think the -- anybody that has followed Celesio specifically would recognize that there have been certain operating challenges that they have faced and I believe that they're beginning to address. However, McKesson really can't be involved in their decisions and their actions to correct some of their challenges. I would also remind everyone that the synergies that we believe come from gaining operational control and that we've outlined on a continued basis remain very significant and we believe would also provide another vehicle to offset some of the operating challenges that may exist on a country level within Celesio. And clearly, they highlighted the strength of the U.K. business and the continued performance there, which I think is a positive.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then just one quick follow-up. I think John, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that Rite Aid operational -- operation transition was completed. Should we assume that the contribution from Rite Aid in the quarter is now at full run rate? And also, around kind of like along those lines, you announced that you've extended your contract with CVS from 3 years to 10 years a couple of months ago. Should we assume that, that was also in your updated guidance, assuming that the step-down in pricing is you normally see with product renewals and extensions? Or is this something that we should factor in through fiscal year '16?
John H. Hammergren: Well, the Rite Aid operational completion took place in the quarter, so I would suggest that not 100% of the results were realized in the quarter. But I do think it's certainly bounded by the range that we've provided and continue to support. Likewise, I would say the CVS contract renewal or extension was a -- was contemplated also as we thought about our comments last quarter and this quarter. So I don't think there will be any specific changes to our guidance going forward based on either of those 2 events.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.
George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: John and James, I wonder if I can kind of revisit Lisa's question in a different way, which is if we look at how you guys came out of Q1, results were really strong and you got the guidance raise. And then kind of as we've moved through now, the company has seen some significant headwinds, but the guidance has been maintained. You talked about the $0.04 euro impact and the FX impact. There's probably a couple of pennies of just weakness in the Celesio business as France and Germany and Brazil deteriorate. Nexium and COPAXONE get pushed out. I guess, what I want to know is would you quantify kind of if we were to -- kind of back to Lisa's $0.10 question, is that the right number? Or would you guys kind of quantify the things that have changed in your -- the things that have changed versus your original expectations, kind of what were they worth and how should we think about those moving pieces?
James A. Beer: Well, I won't have a specific issue-by-issue breakdown for you. But as you note there in your question, we have changed during the year our guide for Distribution and Solutions margins. So originally, before we saw the hep C type volumes, we were thinking that we could grow those margins high single digits. And then as we got a better understanding of the hep C volumes during Q1, we brought that down to the mid-single-digit growth that we talked about 90 days ago. And what we're doing today is again updating that view for these continued growth on the hep C side as well as these other items that you're mentioning that are coming into play, particularly around the brand to generic conversion time lines. So you can kind of think of that margin point progression along the lines of the impact of the hep C drugs originally, and then this quarter, both hep C and the brand to generic conversion.
John H. Hammergren: And I also would say, George, I guess to be more specific, I think you're accurate in your assessment that the strength of the underlying business has offset some of these challenges that we didn't contemplate. So as much as we are missing the margin related to 2 product launches, we've largely been able to grow through that by the strength in our proprietary OneStop Generics program, which even without the Rite Aid volume, grew by more than 20% in the quarter. And the strength in the rest of our operations that continue to deal with the headwinds delivered by the delay in the Generics, the headwind delayed -- the headwind related to the FX, the currency exchange rates, and the headwind delivered by Celesio's revised view of the rest of their year. All of those are built in and yet, we're still optimistic that we'll be within the guidance range that we've provided. So I think people should feel good about the underlying operating results of the business, given those circumstances.
George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Yes. That's kind of where I'm going, John. And maybe then just a quick follow-up is I'm actually not looking at the margin mix impact, I'm looking at the absolute gross profit dollar growth impact. And kind of x these things, it's safe to assume that gross profit dollar growth would have been stronger than you guys reported. So I guess, James, I would just ask, you talked about the hep C drugs. You guys are making an absolute gross profit dollar on them, they're not loss leaders for you guys. So they're additive to the gross profit line, right?
James A. Beer: They are, but very much more dilutive than the norm from a margin perspective.
Operator: Our next question is from Bob Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: We've heard from some of the retailers about pressures they're experiencing from both generic inflation and reimbursement pressure from payers. I'm just curious, do either of these issues that they're facing have any collateral risk to you? And along those lines, are any of these issues that have arisen at the retail level made others more skeptical of joining some of these purchasing platforms, obviously, specifically McKesson's purchasing platform?
John H. Hammergren: I think it's interesting when you talk about customers because each one of our customers experience their business in an individual way because they're a mix of payers, their view of inflation, their contracting processes, how they price their book, are all different. So I think it's difficult to lump everybody into a giant basket and say this is how they're being affected. And I think that independents clearly have a different book of business than the large chains do and certainly, mail orders, et cetera, have different vehicles by which they offset or take advantage of trends in the business. I would say that McKesson continues to focus on the success of our customers, and we remain extremely flexible in our relationships with our customers to make sure that they're afforded an opportunity to continue to enjoy the efficiencies of doing business with a wholesaler, while at the same time, taking advantage of the opportunities that they may have enjoyed outside of the wholesale channel in the past. I'm absolutely convinced that with the exception of perhaps one of our customers, all of our customers would benefit by buying their generics strictly through McKesson. And I believe that we will continue to make progress on our ability to grow our business on the Generics side more rapidly because of our increased penetration of our existing customers and the strength of our model going forward. So I have no doubt that we will continue to evolve our partnership with our customers in a way that adds value to them and grows our business at the same time.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. And I guess just my follow-up around generic purchasing. There is some chatter or concern in the marketplace that maybe some of the synergies that were originally mapped out on paper relative to these purchasing consortiums might not be translating at the actual negotiations level with generic manufacturers. I'm just wondering if you could comment around how your negotiations have progressed as you've gone out to the generic manufacturers around buying better with more scale? And any change relative to the original or previous expectations that you laid out around the procurement benefit?
John H. Hammergren: Well, you've heard us talk regularly and repeatedly about our success with our relationship with Rite Aid, which is clearly our largest example of an alignment of a customer buying off of our contract book and our ability to work together with our combined volumes in a way that delivers benefit to both enterprises. And I think that is the best proof point. I would point out that there are many voices in this discussion. And the voices have different objectives perhaps. And that maybe the objectives of some of those voices is to try to make sure that these purchasing collaboratives, cooperatives, joint ventures, whatever you want to call them are not successful in aggregating volume because it may be to the disadvantage of other people in these channels. And so I -- all I can speak to is the fact that we continue to get the benefits that we had expected as we entered these arrangements. Or we continue to build our book of business, which adds significant value to the manufacturing partners that are part of our solution going forward and deliver significant value to the customers that have availed themselves of not only the price points that are available through McKesson because of our scale, but also to the service offering that we make available to our customers that take them out of the logistics business that is clearly more superior coming from McKesson. So I would say that we remain extremely optimistic, and the data that we're seeing continues to possibly reinforce the decisions we've made around generic sourcing.
James A. Beer: And until we get operating control, we can't even have discussions with the manufacturing partners that include Celesio's volumes.
John H. Hammergren: Right. So that's yet to begin.
Operator: Our next question is from Steven Valiquette with UBS.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So I'll also pile on and ask a question on generics as well. But for me, I guess on the inflation, if I recall, I think you were previously including some of the new product launches in your generic inflation outlook, of the high single digits for this year. So I guess with your inflation view unchanged, but with some of these delays and some of the big launches that you've talked about, I presume we would have been high margin. Could we potentially infer that maybe the inflation trend on the older base of generic products is perhaps greater than expected to offset those launch delays? Or am I just -- perhaps I'm reading too much into that?
John H. Hammergren: Well, I think Steven, you asked a very good question, and this is a very confusing discussion for almost everybody involved in it because the definition of generic inflation is done differently by different people in the business. So I think it's important for us to explain how we think about it when we talk about our view of generic inflation being unchanged from the point from which we gave guidance coming into this year. Maybe James can give you a little color on how we define generic inflation.
James A. Beer: Yes, our definition is for generic drugs beyond their exclusivity period. So you can think of those as the more mature drugs. So we would specifically exclude from our commentary those drugs that are just now converting from brand to generic. So again, the experience that we've had thus far this year leaves us comfortable with our full year guide that we would see generics outside of their exclusivity period, rising high single digits year-over-year. So as John alluded to a little bit earlier on one of his responses, that's a smaller year-over-year increase than we saw last year, but still clearly well above the historical norms for generic price inflation.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. Yes, I appreciate that clarity, but I guess at the same time, it leaves me scratching my head though on the discrepancy then on your view of the generic inflation outlook versus some of the peers that I thought were also definitely excluding those new launches from their inflation outlook but were suggesting lower numbers. So I guess we can follow up off-line on that.
James A. Beer: Yes...
John H. Hammergren: The other thing I'd say, Steven. I know you're off the line now, but I would say that remember, everything we say is related to McKesson's book of business and our mix. So I'm not sure that everybody's mix would be similar to ours or book, so that might be an additional variable that people can't reconcile.
James A. Beer: And then also the way we think about the dollars that we drive from those price increases are very much related to the inventories that we have for those drugs that are seeing the price increases. So you would, I think, naturally see between that as well as the mix point that John is making, a variability across different parties.
John H. Hammergren: And different fiscal years as well.
Operator: The next question is from Ross Muken with ISI Group.
Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: So it seems like Medical continues to track along reasonably well. Can you talk about sort of the next phase of sort of the PSS integration and synergies? It seems like we've sort of moved on from the initial profit capture there. And it seems like the margin profile is still maintaining quite well and hopefully, moving up. And so maybe just give us a little bit of a picture of kind of how that is trending currently.
John H. Hammergren: Now sure, Ross. And the PSS integration has been trending very positively for McKesson. We are through the phase which included the retention of the sales forces and the combination of our sourcing activities and the things we are doing around the brands and compensation systems, et cetera. And now we're into sort of the heavy-lifting phase, which is the consolidation of some of the distribution and transportation infrastructures of the 2 companies. Probably less risk, but maybe even more work, given the amount of energy that has to go into making these consolidations happen, but clearly, there's a lot of value left to harvest out of the integration as we take out some of this duplication from an expense perspective. But most important, I think, was our ability to retain the sales forces with their great relationships with our customers, to continue to focus on our customers' success and our performance with those customers, and now to take some of the cost out that's redundant.
Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: And maybe just on Tech Solutions. Obviously, a very good margin print this quarter. But the revenues, given some of your actions, continue to drag. And it seems like maybe by the end of the year, into early next year, we could possibly get back to revenue growth. I mean, is it your belief, once we sort of comp through these changes, that we can sort of maintain sort of the margin trajectory, hopefully, up to the mid- to upper teens while also kind of -- sort of starting the growth engine in that piece?
John H. Hammergren: That's probably premature to guide on what we might see in the fiscal year ahead or beyond. I would say that our businesses are well positioned, that we know of the business that we've had the biggest challenge with in the EMR kind of space. We do -- we believe that our long-range guidance on margins should be in the high teens. And so clearly, we see that as a continued objective for us in the business. And we should be growing the businesses at or above market rates when we're post this transition of Horizon to Paragon. So I think we remain cautiously optimistic that we're in the right places at the right time. I would certainly point to you and to other listeners that know this business, that we have a very large footprint in medical imaging. Although we have a very significant market share there, the customers have not been focused on imaging products, they have been focused on buying products to meet their requirements from a Meaningful Use perspective. So some of the revenues in that business have been not growing, that we hope will grow again once people get past their obligations to meet government regulations.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dave Francis with RBC Capital Markets.
David K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: John, as it relates to the kind of ending process of getting operational control of Celesio, is there anything out there in that process either in or outside of your control that might change your expectations relative to the calendar and timing of when you guys do achieve operating control?
John H. Hammergren: I think it's difficult to speak about this process with certainty. I can tell you that our expectations remain that we will get operational control this calendar year. There is a process that's outlined for it, and the parties that are involved have presented their facts and their cases as they see them in the process. And we're hopeful that we'll get an outcome that allows us to move forward with domination, like I said, by the end of the fiscal year. So I think it's difficult to say other than the fact that we remain optimistic and there's been no new news that would cause us to change our view of being optimistic about making it through this process.
David K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Is it -- a quick follow-up then, switching gears a little bit. On the logistics side of your business, given the sharp decline in fuel prices here of late, is there any way -- or I guess, is there a meaningful contribution to lower expenses that you guys are seeing from lower fuel prices generally? And is there any way that you guys might be able to help us quantify that benefit?
John H. Hammergren: Well, clearly, there's a benefit in our transportation cost centers across the corporation when fuel prices are in a decline. I'd have to say though, Dave, they're -- in aggregate, they're not a material impact at all to McKesson. And that's something that we focus on in a real specific way. And a portion of our transportation is already outsourced so the benefit would fall to those contract agents that we use in logistics. But I think that it's certainly not a negative event, and we are encouraged by it, but it won't have any meaningful impact on our business.
Operator: Our next question is from Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: A little bit of a leading question, perhaps, but thinking about hep C, well, it's perhaps a little bit more than you expected obviously to begin the year and maybe even this quarter. I doubt The Street mismodeled hep C by the nearly $2 billion that you beat in North America pharmaceutical, if I adjust for international. And your Med-Surg revenue also was pretty good. So when I think about that, I think about Owens & Minor this morning beating by 2.5%, 3%. It seems to me like overall market activity, utilization volumes, et cetera, are up. But I haven't really heard you talk much about that tonight, and it's always good to get a distributor to true-up what we're hearing from the labs and hospitals. So I'll just ask you for your comments on the overall market environment.
John H. Hammergren: Sure, Eric. Thanks. We do see, I think, at the margin, an increase in utilization across all of our businesses. I think that almost every one of our executives would say that they believe that there is a certain amount of revenue increase being driven by just more patients in the system and patients in the system that have the appropriate coverage or at least some coverage from an insurance perspective. So I think that it has been a positive component to our results. And I think I'd also add that as people take on more risk for the patients and they're paid for performance, whereas we've talked about paid for value or outcomes, we find that the utilization of pharmaceuticals increases. It's the first and best avenue for people to go to if they have responsibility for a patient to make sure they're on their meds, they stay on their meds, and that I think also will continue to be a fuel for our industry. So I think that in light of what's happening, I think we remain optimistic that this is having some -- at least at the edges, some effect on revenue growth.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: John, if I could ask you this question, I think 1 large European pharma manufacturer is talking about diabetes this morning, talked about some big price competition going on with some of its other competitors. It's kind of new in the sense that these are large-branded categories, would not really need generic competition. I saw a little bit of that, I think, with -- sorry, asthma drugs, a little bit earlier. Can you talk about some of the dynamics you're seeing in the market on the brand side here? And does that have any positive or negative effects for you as the distributor?
John H. Hammergren: Well, we continue to see innovation on the brand side as we've talked about with some of the specialty drugs that have come out. I have to admit that I'm not that close to some of the diabetes work that you refer to. And I do think that as we've talked about, we continue to see price increases on the brand side in line with our expectations and sort of the historical performance. So I think what -- reflecting that at a 40,000-foot level, I think we're pleased to see innovation returning to the brand world, and these companies are not only going to make a difference in people's lives, but they certainly will help provide additional fuel for our industry. So I think that, that would be my takeaway.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Great. Then maybe if I can just follow up then on hep C more specifically. As we go into next year and we get more competition in the class, does that offer you some opportunities? Or is it really a function here that brand drugs remain -- that the margins, regardless of the manufacturer, will likely be small for you guys in this category?
John H. Hammergren: Well, it's difficult to forecast specialty drugs or new drug launches in a sort of a uniform way. Clearly, some of these drugs will be launched in oncology, and we're very optimistic that when new launches happen in oncology, they're not only better for the patients, but they're also, because of our position in oncology, better for our business. And we benefit from the position we have in that marketplace and can help the manufacturers get their product not only through clinical trial, but also utilized in the correct fashion. And that provides an opportunity for us economically. The hep C product, because of its unusual orientation towards government buyers and mail-order buyers, has an unusual distortion, so to speak, in our volume because of our footprint in those markets. And so I would say that other specialty launches may not have a similar characteristic in terms of the uptake of the product. And so each channel has a different characteristic for us from an economic perspective. But overall, we're happy to see the innovation happen.
Operator: We'll take a question from David Larsen with Leerink Swann.
David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: So as more hep C drugs come to market, say, next year, is that generally a positive for your margins?
John H. Hammergren: Well, hep C has been a negative for our margins. As James discussed, it was a significant impact in the quarter for our margins and will continue to be a drag on our ability to get to our guided margin for the year, and that's why we've changed it and were specific about it. Over the long term, clearly, we believe this stuff will flow through the system and we were still confident with our long-term objectives of 250 to 300 basis points for Distribution Solutions. Clearly, we need to continue to evaluate the economics of these products as related to the service we provide to both the manufacturers and to our customers. And we need to make sure we're being properly paid by the channel for the role that we play. And hep C clearly would be a product that we would focus on, and future products of this characteristic, we would have to focus on to make sure that the dilutive margin effect that it's had doesn't continue.
David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: Yes. It's clear that as a percentage of revenue, your gross margins would have an unfavorable impact. But as more competing hep C products come to market, relative to having only, say, 1 vendor like Gilead, would you generally earn more gross profit dollars as competition comes to market for that therapeutic class?
John H. Hammergren: Well, that's a good question. I think the ability for us to be paid for affecting the competition would require us to have some role in the channel. And it's not clear to me that we would be in a position to tell our mail order customers, for example, which hep C drug they're going to put on their formulary. So in that specific example, it may be difficult for us to increase our margins specifically because of an additional launch in the category of another branded product. It will probably not provide the same ability for us to move share that, for example, generic drugs provide us. So I'm not particularly optimistic about that single event.
David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: Okay. Great. And then just any preliminary thoughts around fiscal 2016, the impact of new generic launches? It seems like with these pushes, there could be a positive comp impact for fiscal '16, and it seems like there could be some pretty big ones, Nexium, COPAXONE, ABILIFY, maybe Enbrel and Advair. Any general thoughts around that?
John H. Hammergren: Well, clearly, to the extent that these positives are pushed into next fiscal year, then that's where they will be realized. And so I think we remain optimistic that our position in Generics is doing nothing but improving. And that as our scale and our footprint expands globally, we'll be able to bring even more value to the market relative to the generic manufacturers and to partner even more closely with them. So yes, I'd say on the margin, we're excited about the Generic portfolio as we look forward.
Operator: We will take our last question from Garen Sarafian with Citi.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I wanted to go back to Celesio. You stated how your expectations are to have operational control by year-end and the fast-track approval. So I'm wondering if it's not, what's the alternate method entail? So maybe if you could give a worse case or best case range of outcomes there, I would really appreciate it.
John H. Hammergren: Well, thank you for the question, Garen. I don't know that we have a firm view on the time line or the potential outcome in terms of how long it would take us to gain operational control. I think if we don't get it in the fast-track process, we remain extremely optimistic that we will get it. And then it's just a question of why didn't the fast-track happen and what do we need to do to facilitate the right decision, which is to give us operational control later on in the process. And so I think it's difficult to speculate.
James A. Beer: But all of that said, we still remain confident that we are going to get operating control in this calendar year.
John H. Hammergren: Well, I want to thank you, operator, and also, I want to thank all of you on the call for your time today. I'm pleased with our solid results in the second quarter and I want to recognize our employees who dedicate themselves to focusing on our customer's success and continue to drive outstanding performance across our businesses. I will now hand the call off to Erin for her review of upcoming events for the financial community. Erin?
Erin Lampert: Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events for the financial community. On November 11, we will present at the Crédit Suisse Health Care Conference in Phoenix, Arizona. And on January 13, we will present at the JPMorgan Health Care Conference in San Francisco. We will release third quarter earnings results in late January. Thank you, and goodbye.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect, and have a good day.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the McKesson Corporation Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. And now, your host for today's call, Ms. Erin Lampert, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Lampert, please go ahead, ma'am.
Erin Lampert: Thank you, Rufus. Good morning, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2015 First Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update and will then introduce James, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after 1 hour at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results acquisition expenses and related adjustments, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, certain litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for investors. Please refer to our press release announcing first quarter fiscal 2015 results available on our website for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thanks. And here's John Hammergren.
John H. Hammergren: Thanks, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Today we reported a strong start to fiscal 2015 with total company revenues of $44.1 billion with adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.49. Based on the strength of our Distribution Solutions results in the first quarter and our confidence in the full year, we are raising our previous outlook and now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $10.50 to $10.90 for fiscal 2015. Before I begin my comments on our business performance for the quarter, I want to provide a brief update on 2 items. First, I'm pleased with the outcome of the Celesio Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, which was held on July 15 in Stuttgart, Germany. As part of the standard German legal process, at that meeting, shareholders voted to approve the domination agreement between McKesson and Celesio. The domination agreement must be registered with the German courts in order to become effective. Before that registration can take place, minority shareholders may assert challenges, which may be based on substance or technical grounds. Anticipate that at least 1 challenge will be filed. Under German law, there is a limited period of time for such disputes to be heard. Based on our current assessment, we now expect that the domination agreement will be registered with the German courts and therefore, McKesson will be allowed to exercise operating control over Celesio at the end of the current calendar year. This time line represents a modest delay from our previous expectation that we would achieve operating control late in the first half of fiscal 2015. The second item I want to highlight is related to the sale of our International Technology business. Approximately 1 year ago, we talked about a number of actions to better position the company going forward, including our intention to sell our International Technology business. This business consisted of 2 main divisions: clinical and financial solutions, and workforce solutions. In July, we completed the sale of the clinical and financial systems portion of McKesson International Technology's business -- our McKesson International Technology business. The workforce solution division, which provides workforce and payroll solutions to the U.K. National Health Service, was not included as part of the sale. As a result, it was determined that this business would need to be reclassified from discontinued operations, where we reported the results in fiscal 2014, back into continuing operations for fiscal 2015. As part of the reclassification of this business, from discontinued operations to continuing operations, we recognized a pretax charge of $34 million or $0.11 per diluted share in our first quarter adjusted earnings results. It's important to note that our sole contract in the U.K.-based workforce solutions business with the NHS expires in late calendar 2015. We do not intend to rebid this contract going forward. And therefore, we'll continue to operate the business only to the end of the existing contract. Moving on to our business results for the quarter. Distribution Solutions had a strong start to the year with revenue of $43.3 billion in the quarter, up 38%, adjusted operating profit of $1 billion, up 44%, and both are reported on constant currency basis.  North America distribution and services, which includes our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, McKesson Specialty Health and McKesson Canada, delivered strong results for the quarter aided by higher-than-expected revenue growth. Within North America, revenue growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business exceeded our expectations in the first quarter, driven primarily by strong demand for 2 recently launched drugs for the treatment of Hepatitis C, as well as solid growth across our independent national retail and mail order customers. Based on this revenue strength in the first quarter, we are now -- we now believe revenue growth in North America will be modestly ahead of our original expectations for the year. Within our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, we also experienced solid growth across our portfolio of generic and brand pharmaceuticals, driven in part by the timing of certain generic and brand price increases, which came earlier in the fiscal year than we had originally planned. It is important to note, however, our full year expectations for both brand and generic inflation remained unchanged. We continue to make solid progress in executing our new agreement with Rite Aid. And as you saw in our recent press release, I am delighted with the extension of our long-standing distribution relationship with CVS Caremark through June of 2019. As you know, we have a tremendous track record of delivering comprehensive supply chain solutions to CVS. We are proud to continue this valued relationship. Last week, we hosted our annual conference for retail independent customers, which brought together thousands of community pharmacy owners and pharmacists from across the country. This year's conference helped attendees understand the transformation in the market driven by an emphasis on patient -- positive patient outcomes, continued growth of preferred networks and a focus on the pharmacy's ability to impact important quality and patient satisfaction ratings. Our conference attracts a significant number of our Health Mart customers and we are extremely proud to have reached a milestone of more than 3,400 Health Mart pharmacy members. In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business in the first quarter and the great start to this fiscal year. Moving now to our specialty business. We had solid results in the first quarter with nice growth across the business. At our recent Investor Day, we highlighted the diversity of our specialty portfolio, where we are a leading service and technology provider across multiple specialty areas. It is this diversity of our broad portfolio that sets us apart. In particular, our model through U.S. Oncology provides comprehensive services across the spectrum of the cancer care. We're excited about the progress we continue to make in our specialty business and believe we are well positioned to continue to grow and innovate in this dynamic market. And our Canadian business had a solid start to the year with results that were in line with our expectations for the first quarter. Turning now to our results for international pharmaceutical distribution and services. Revenues for the first quarter were $7.6 billion, an increase of 3% on the underlying results of Celesio on a constant currency basis. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we continue to move through the required steps to achieve operating control of the company. We now expect to achieve this milestone by the end of our current calendar year. Turning to our Medical-Surgical business. Revenues were $1.4 billion for the first quarter, an increase of 2% over the prior year. We're off to a solid start to the year in our Medical-Surgical business and we continue to make good progress optimizing our distribution network and technology platforms related to the acquisition of PSS World Medical. In summary, we are off to a strong start to the year in Distribution Solutions. We are extremely well positioned across all of our distribution businesses and we are confident in our improved outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. Technology Solutions revenues were down 8% for the first quarter, driven primarily by anticipated revenue softness in our Horizon Clinical software platform and the disposition of our product line as we discussed on our last earnings call. Adjusted operating margins in this segment were 10.4%, which includes the $34 million pretax charge associated with the reclassification of a portion of our International Technology business from discontinued operations to continuing operations. Excluding this charge, adjusted operating margins for this segment would have been 15%. More broadly, we continued to made steady progress across our Technology Solutions businesses. Our first quarter results benefited from the steady growth profile of our RelayHealth Connectivity business, along with positive results in our physician services and medical imaging businesses. I also want to highlight the recent success of the CommonWell Health Alliance. Over a year ago, McKesson collaborated with several other organizations to demonstrate our leadership in finding solutions to address the issue of data interoperability in our industry. These companies recognized early on that pervasive connectivity cannot be accomplished by any one vendor. It must be implemented in a way that all vendors and systems can effectively participate. The CommonWell Health Alliance began with 5 founding members, all with a common goal, to change the standards of interoperability for the nation. And today, the alliance has grown to include a total of 11 members. Recently, the CommonWell members were able to demonstrate success through the launch of foundational services across 4 geographies, and in select pilot locations. The goal of the pilots was to validate the proof of concept and understand from the providers the ways in which we can continue to bring added value. We have been encouraged by the success of the pilots. And now CommonWell members, including McKesson, are gearing up for expansion and commercialization of the program with the foundational services provided by RelayHealth and a plan to continue to add members to the alliance. We are very pleased with the success to date and are looking forward, along with our partners, to the next growth phase for CommonWell. In summary, we continue to make solid progress in our key strategic priorities for McKesson Technology Solutions, including helping our customers reduce cost, operate more efficiently, providing our customers with solutions to drive improved analytics and supporting our customers' transformation to a world of value-based care. Now to wrap up my comments for our fiscal first quarter. The strength of our operating performance is reflected in our strong financial results for the quarter, which, I'll remind you, include the charge of $0.11 per diluted share as a result of the reclassification of a portion of our International Technology business to continuing operations. This was not contemplated in our original plan. In light of the strong operating performance, we are pleased with our improved outlook for the full year. And as I noted at the beginning of my remarks, we are raising our guidance by a range of $0.10, to $10.50 to $10.90 for fiscal 2015. In addition to the strength of our operating performance, we continue to have a strong balance sheet. In the first quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $182 million. And our expectation to deliver cash flow from operations of approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2015 remains unchanged from our original guidance. We are extremely well positioned to execute our portfolio approach to capital deployment to continue to deliver value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to James. And we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?
James A. Beer: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with our first quarter results, which represent a strong start to fiscal 2015. And as John discussed earlier, we are raising our previous outlook and now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $10.50 to $10.90. Today, I will walk you through our first quarter financial results and provide an update on our acquisition of Celesio. Before I move on, let me remind you that in this quarter, both GAAP and adjusted earnings reflect the reclassification of a portion of our International Technology business, referred to as our workforce business, from discontinued operations back to continuing operations. Releases to the workforce business reclassification, we recorded a pretax charge of $34 million or $0.11 per share, largely representing a onetime catch-up of depreciation and amortization on the underlying assets as we move the business from discontinued to continuing operations. It is also important to note that fiscal '14 was recast to include the results of the workforce business. Schedule 9 provides a recast fiscal '14 consolidated and technology segment revenues. Revenues for the workforce business were $31 million during the first quarter of fiscal '14 and $147 million for the full year. Fiscal '14, as recast for the addition of the workforce business, includes $0.04 and $0.21 in contribution to adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter and full year, respectively, as outlined on Schedules 7 and 8. Now let's move to our results for the quarter. My remarks today will focus on our first quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $2.49, which excludes 3 items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles; acquisition expenses and related adjustments; and LIFO-related adjustments. Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedule 2. Consolidated revenues increased 37% for the quarter to $44.1 billion. On this 37% revenue growth, adjusted gross profit for the quarter increased 50% to $2.9 billion, driven by Celesio and the strong performance of our Distribution Solutions segment. Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.9 billion were up 64% for the quarter, mainly driven by Celesio. Excluding the impact of Celesio, operating expenses increased 3% for the quarter. Other income was $21 million for the quarter. Interest expense increased 71% versus the prior year to $101 million, driven by debt issued and assumed related to our acquisition of Celesio. Now moving to taxes. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 31.2%. As usual, I would expect this tax rate to fluctuate somewhat from quarter-to-quarter. Adjusted income for the quarter was $585 million, with our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations at $2.49. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding increased by 1% year-over-year to 235 million. Let's now turn to the segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3. Distribution Solutions segment revenues increased for the quarter to $43.3 billion, up 38% on a reported and constant currency basis. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 14% to $34.3 billion, primarily reflecting market growth, including sales of 2 recently launched drugs for the treatment of Hepatitis C, the delay of certain generic launches to later in the fiscal year and growth in our Canadian and specialty businesses. In addition, as John mentioned, in this quarter, we recorded solid growth across our portfolio of generic and branded pharmaceuticals, driven in part by the timing of certain generic and brand price increases, which came earlier in the fiscal year than we had originally planned. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 15%. Based on the growth we have seen, primarily from the sales of 2 hepatitis C drugs, we now expect that North America will be modestly ahead of our previous full year expectations of mid-single-digit revenue growth. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $7.6 billion for the first quarter. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 3% on the underlying revenues of Celesio. Medical-Surgical revenues were up 2% for the quarter, driven by market growth. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit increased 68% for the quarter on 38% revenue growth, resulting in 106 basis points improvement in our adjusted gross profit margin. In addition to the Celesio acquisition, our first quarter gross profit in Distribution Solutions benefited from favorable performance in our pharmaceutical portfolio, including earlier-than-expected generic and brand price increases that occurred late in the quarter. Our full year assumption for generic and brand price inflation remains unchanged. Adjusted operating expense for the segment increased 90% for the quarter, driven by our acquisition of Celesio. Excluding Celesio, operating expenses for the segment increased 4% year-over-year. The segment adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 232 basis points, an improvement of 9 basis points versus the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, we now expect revenue growth for our North America pharmaceutical distribution and services business to be modestly ahead of expectations. Based on the anticipated mix of revenue in our North American business, we now expect operating margins to increase mid-single-digit basis points year-over-year. Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were down 8% for the quarter to $768 million. This decline was primarily driven by the anticipated revenue softness of the Horizon Clinical software platform and the planned elimination of a product line, offset by growth in our other technology businesses. It is important to note that relative to fiscal '14's recast revenues, the workforce business revenues are expected to be down year-over-year. And as a result, we now expect segment revenues for the full year to decline by low single-digits year-over-year. As I discussed earlier, first quarter GAAP and adjusted results for Technology Solutions reflect a pretax charge of $34 million or $0.11 per share. $32 million of these charges reduced segment adjusted gross profit, while a further $2 million increased the segment's operating expenses this quarter. Adjusted operating expenses in the segment decreased 4%, driven primarily by restructuring actions taken in the prior year. First quarter adjusted operating profit for the segment was down 45% to $80 million, and the adjusted operating margin rate was 10.42%, representing a decrease of 692 basis points versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of the workforce business charge, the adjusted operating margin rate was 15%. Based on the reclassification of the workforce business, we now expect the full year adjusted operating margin for the segment to be at the mid-teens level. Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. In addition, this quarter's working capital metrics also include Celesio. For receivables, our days sales outstanding increased 2 days versus the prior year. Excluding Celesio, our days sales outstanding remained flat at 24 days. Our days sales in inventories were flat year-over-year at 31 days. Our days sales in payables were flat year-over-year at 50 days. Excluding Celesio, our days sales in payables increased 2 days to 52 days. We generated $182 million in cash flow from operations for the quarter. Overall, for the full year, we continue to expect our cash flow from operations to be approximately $3 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $4.1 billion with $1.9 billion held offshore. Internal capital spending was $119 million for the quarter. Now I'll turn to our adjusted EPS outlook for the year. As I mentioned earlier, we are raising our fiscal 2015 guidance for adjusted earnings from continuing operations per diluted share from our original range of $10.40 to $10.80 to a new range of $10.50 to $10.90. In addition, we now expect $1.32 per share in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and $0.50 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. We also expect to exclude between $0.95 and $1.05 per share in LIFO-related adjustments. Before concluding my remarks, I would like to briefly review some important aspects of the next steps in our acquisition of Celesio. As John mentioned earlier, we now expect to secure operating control by the end of the calendar year. We continue to believe we can achieve the previously stated accretion range of $1 to $1.20 on an adjusted earnings basis during the 12-month period beginning February 2014. You will recall, however, that this range assumes 100% ownership. Our current ownership stake in Celesio remains at 76%. By the fourth year following completion of the required steps to obtain operating control, we continue to expect to realize annual synergies between $275 million and $325 million. In summary, McKesson delivered strong financial results during the first quarter and we are well positioned for the remainder of the fiscal year. Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Rufus?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And for our first question, we go to George Hill with Deutsche Bank.
George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I guess, James, maybe I'll just ask a couple of questions about the guidance for back half of the year. Net of the IT charge, is it right to think about that you guys are actually kind of taking the guidance up by $0.20 considering the $0.11 -- or call it $0.21, given the IT charge kind of taken in the quarter?
James A. Beer: Well, certainly, obviously, we do include that IOG charge, workforce business charge, in our adjusted earnings. So absent that, yes, we are upping the formal guide by $0.10. But in the first quarter, yes, you're right. We did absorb an $0.11 charge associated with that workforce business.
George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. I wanted to make sure I understood that quickly. And then maybe just a quick follow-up either for James or John. Generic drug price inflation has obviously been very strong in helping the performance of the IT business. I guess, can you talk about expectations for the back half of the year, given the strength that you saw in the front half of the year?
John H. Hammergren: Well, we did think -- we do think there was some pull-forward, George, of our generic price inflation models for the full fiscal year, but we really don't change -- we haven't changed our outlook if you think about it on a full year basis. So I think right now it's early for our fiscal year, but we believe that the guidance we gave you at the beginning of the year is still reasonable.
Operator: And for our next question, we go to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I was wondering if maybe if we look at the overall drug distribution revenue, and then, John, I think you talked about the Hep C drug. But if you back out Hep C in the quarter, can you maybe give us an idea of what you're seeing for underlying utilization and any early signs of ACA? We see Rite Aid just reported this morning again strong results on the pharma side. So I'm just wondering what you're seeing in your model.
John H. Hammergren: Well, it's difficult to account for what the Affordable Care Act effect is in our business. We came into the year believing there would be some modest effect from it and we still believe that's the case. We really had strength across the entire segment of Rx revenues, Canada and Specialty, in particular, came in very strong for us. So I think we're pleased with the momentum that we have. And as you mentioned, the Hep C drugs were also a surprise to us, of how quickly they've been taken up, and the volumes that we received there. So I think, overall, we're pleased with the performance of the revenues in that business.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then, John, just as a follow up, you mentioned the extension of your relationship with CVS. Are there any changes of note to that new relationship that goes through 2019?
John H. Hammergren: It's basically the same form that we've had with them in the past in terms of the service and the relationship. So we're pleased to have renewed it, and we think it continues to show the quality of the service and the relationships we have with our customers.
Operator: And we go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: A couple of questions here. First of all, I think, I heard the comment on the operating margin now expected to grow at mid-single due to mix. So can you guys just give us some more color on the underlying kind of like revenue mix and kind of like what you've seen that was different in your expectations?
James A. Beer: Yes, the driver of my comments around the Distribution Solutions' operating margin is really the impact of the Hep C drugs that we saw really having a very strong rollout in this last quarter, and that is what's driving the margin effect.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then just kind of like a quick follow-up. On kind of like just the Rite Aid generic contract, I know -- I think you said that you expect to see the benefits flowing through in the September quarter, so is this still kind of like -- is timing still consistent with your earlier expectations?
John H. Hammergren: We're really pleased with the continued performance in our relationship with Rite Aid. I would say that our contract negotiations are -- have progressed the way we had anticipated. The conversation around September was probably more focused on our delivery of generics to their individual stores. So we are probably better than halfway through the implementation of store delivery of generics directed by McKesson, and that will continue to evolve until we have 100% of that responsibility as we get to the fall time frame.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And in terms of contribution to your bottom line, should we see that in the following quarter?
John H. Hammergren: I think you -- our guidance anticipates the effect of Rite Aid's business flowing through McKesson. And so I -- other than the dilutive effect, it has been a bit of a surprise from Hep C from a margin rate perspective. The rest of the performance of the business is right in line with our expectations.
Operator: We'll go next to Glen Santangelo with Crédit Suisse.
Glen J. Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: John, I just want to talk to you about the North American Distribution business. The company continues to post very solid results in that segment and if I hear you correctly, obviously, specialty sort of helped the revenue line maybe volumes also helped the revenue line. But if I filter that down to the operating profit line, we're still seeing very sizable beats. And I'm wondering if you could help us sort of think through what might really be driving that better-than-expected result. Is it the branded and generic price inflation being pulled forward? Is it the volumes? Or -- we're not really sure what the margins look like on the specialty drugs you're talking about. So any sort of help in triangulating what's really driving that operating profit would be helpful.
John H. Hammergren: I think it comes from many of the sources that you just highlighted. Clearly, the brand and generic performance in the quarter was very strong. We're pleased with the revenue growth we received, in particular, out of Canada and in Specialty. But even our standard Rx business has been supported by robust growth really across-the-board. And the continued uptake of our generic portfolio, the strength of Northstar, our ability to continue to bring market share to our customer base and the strength of OneStop, our generic program in our markets, continues to remain very strong. So I really feel like the businesses in North American pharmaceuticals are performing very well.
Glen J. Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Maybe I'll just follow-up on Celesio. Obviously, they're out with operating results this morning and kind of looking through those results, it seems like maybe some of the segments might have performed a little bit better while some of the other segments continue to be -- face some challenges that I think you've talked about in the past. But maybe could you give us some high-level commentary about maybe what you thought of the results? And is everything kind of performing relative to where you would have expected?
John H. Hammergren: Yes, I think so. Overall, we're basically in line with our expectations. As you noted, in their comments, they've talked a little bit about where their strength is coming and where some of their weaknesses are. And I think that their commentary is generally in line with what we expected.
Operator: Our next question, we go to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So I just wanted to go back to guidance, a couple of moving pieces here relative to the previous communication. Am I correct to assume that there was some slight synergies assumed previously from the timing of operational control of Celesio and would that now not be included in the new guidance range given the pushout of the expectation on operational control? And then on the International Technology business, I understand that you're absorbing the $0.11 charge. But as we think about the balance of the year, are there corresponding earnings from that business that come back into the P&L?
James A. Beer: Yes, so on the first of your questions, what we've spoken about in the past was that we expected just a modest amount of synergies from Celesio during fiscal '15. So yes, at some level, the pushout of operational control by a few months does have some impact on that. But again, they were modest expectations in the first place, I just want to emphasize that. And in terms of the workforce business and the impact later in the year, I would expect that, that would continue year-over-year because again, we've recast history. So we have all of that in the schedules to the press release. I would expect that, that would continue to create something of a headwind year-over-year for the balance of the fiscal '15.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. And then, John, I guess just on the cash deployment, I understand you got probably about 1.5 on hold for Celesio and there's some debt redemptions over the next 18 months. But still a lot of cash with over $4 billion on the balance sheet today, solid cash flow again. Anything you can give us around how we should think about that cash being returned to shareholders or any perspectives on the M&A landscape at this point?
John H. Hammergren: Well, as you point out, there are a couple of uses of the cash that we already have sort of planned into our future. One is the purchase of the remaining outstanding shares of Celesio. We still have 24% left to accumulate, which we believe will happen over time, as well as the debt repayment that we've committed to accomplish as we go forward. We want to remain investment-grade, as we've indicated. And that, as a backdrop, will probably cause us to continue to have a portfolio approach to our capital deployment. But it doesn't mean that we won't return to shareholders, through dividends and share repurchase, some of that cash. But what it does mean is that our priority is to make sure we maintain investment grade and that we avail ourselves of opportunities from an M&A perspective that make sense, which we've done on a regular basis.
Operator: And we go next to Steven Valiquette with UBS.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So a couple of quick ones here. First the 2% revenue growth in the Med-Surg distribution segment, is that an indicative of a normalized run rate that we should expect maybe for the rest of the year?
John H. Hammergren: Well, I think that we believe the Med-Surg business is growing in line with our original expectations. So we think mid-single-digits is probably where we're going to be. So it's a little softer in the quarter than we would have -- we would forecast for the full year. And I think the softness is really in line with what we believe the market performed at for the first [indiscernible] for us. And I have to emphasize that we're really pleased with the continued progress of Med-Surg. From an integration perspective, we are really accomplishing our objectives there, and the team is doing a good job.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then just quickly, you guys had that previous commentary about the percent of earnings in the first half of '15 being similar to fiscal '11 through '13 and I know that was kind of loose sort of guidance or commentary previously. But is that still relevant with these 1Q results or does that sort of go out the window with the strength of 1Q?
James A. Beer: Well, I think what I'd say is I'd stick to the annual guide that we've offered. I think given the quarter-to-quarter volatility in our results, it's hard to give directional assistance to you just for a single quarter. And I think this quarter is a good example of that. We saw some price increases both on the branded side and on the generic side move up into this quarter earlier than we had planned. And then also, we saw some of the brand-to-generic conversions that we were expecting pushed further back towards the end of fiscal '15. So I think I'd really just align you to the overall annual guide.
Operator: And for our next question, we go to Ross Muken with ISI Group.
Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: So it's now been a pretty remarkable period for the company. I mean you obviously had the Celesio acquisition, the Rite Aid agreement. It sort of shows the value you can provide to some of your larger customers. How has that sort of begat discussions with other customers you have in terms of the McKesson value proposition and how you can obviously then prove that you can obviously provide more value to kind of the broader universe as well?
John H. Hammergren: Well, we think our early success with the implementation of the Rite Aid relationship as well as our continued performance in these businesses is an indication of our customers' reliance on our ability to work in partnership with them to deliver superior results. And I think we continue to work with those customers that have not fully availed themselves of the offerings that we have to make sure that they understand the kind of results we think we can obtain together and to help them quantify, not only the savings from sourcing with us, but also the savings associated with having us manage the logistics requirements associated with the purchase of product as well. And there's still significant customers that are somewhat redundant with us related to those deliveries that we think afford both of us opportunities. Having said that, these are big strategic decisions that have to be made and it'll take some time for some customers, I think, to reach the same conclusion that others have already reached. But I think our performance, as the first quarter shows, is an indication of customers' continued reliance on our ability to help them on many dimensions, including sourcing of products.
Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: That's helpful, John. And maybe just on Technology Solutions I mean, this has been a bumpy ride now for quite a while and I know you've done a lot to sort of scale-down some of the clinical pieces where you've struggled. But as you think about the investment in this space and you think about the footprint, I mean -- so what is, at the board level and at the management level, what is the debate on sort of longer-term aspirations and goals for certain businesses? And then how do you -- how did you figure out what needed to go versus what needed to stay and how does that sort of affect how you're going to continue to look at the portfolio, I guess, going forward?
John H. Hammergren: Well, if you set aside the surprise we had, so to speak, going into this quarter, which was the lack of our ability to exit the portion of the international operations business that we had related to the workforce and to run that contract out as opposed to selling it, if you set that aside and you actually look at the performance of the business, it's basically in line with our expectation. And what we've been focused on there is making sure that we have the appropriate operating margin for businesses of this type. That we're growing the earnings of the business in a way that's responsible and reflects the opportunity that we see in front of us. That the growth coming from the positive businesses in that segment are able to offset the drag associated with businesses that are not growing, as we know that they won't in certain categories there. In particular, the Horizon Clinical business that we're in the process of winding our way out of. And I would say that the last dimension that's important to us is these businesses are significant cash producers for us and I think the management team knows how to operate them. So the bumpiness on occasion is caused by things like IOG that we didn't fully expect to roll back into operations, and we'll work our way through that as well. I think at the portfolio level, we have a responsibility to look at this business as well as all of our businesses, not so much in the aggregate in the way that we report them, perhaps. But if you disaggregate them, there are a lot of the smaller businesses and product lines that make up these 2 large segments -- or 3 large segments now. And I think what we're focused on is how do we make sure that we've got the right portfolio of products and services in those segments to grow the business.
Operator: And for our next question, we go to Greg Bolan with Sterne Agee.
Gregory T. Bolan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Guys, I apologize if I missed this. But for the quarter, James, just thinking about the 14% North America pharmaceutical distribution business, what do you believe was the contribution from the Hep C launches for the quarter, just in terms of contribution to growth rate?
James A. Beer: Well, you've seen Gilead announce their results, and I'd just say that directionally, our revenues coming out of Sovaldi, for example, would have been in line with the overall market share across the 3 big distributors in this country.
Gregory T. Bolan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's fair. And then just lastly, on the same topic, as it relates to kind of the margin dilution, if you will, year-on-year from the launch of the Hep C drugs, any noticeable impact just in terms of stomping margin expansion for the distribution solutions segment?
James A. Beer: Well, the guidance that I offered a little earlier, mathematically it represents a very modest reduction in margins for Distribution Solutions. And obviously, those have been going up consistently in recent years. And at Analyst Day, you'll recall that we reset the long-term margin goal for Distribution Solutions up to between 250 and 300 basis points. So modest impact from these Hep C drugs in the short term.
Operator: And for our next question, we go to John Ransom with Raymond James.
John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Sorry to keep beating this horse, but one of your competitors mentioned that generic inflation was higher this year than they thought versus expectations of being lower. You talked about it just being more price pull-throughs earlier than expected, how do you -- how do we square those 2 comments? Has inflation, in fact, been higher than you expected or is it really just timing?
John H. Hammergren: I can't really comment on other's -- other people's comments. But what I would say is that I would reflect on the fact that we all have different fiscal years. We all have different portfolios of generics. We have different proprietary programs in the generic world. We have different relationships with generic manufacturers. And having said all of that, our point of view on generic price inflation for our fiscal year remains unchanged from the guidance we gave you at the beginning of our fiscal year. The only thing that we really tried to clarify in this call was that we believe some of that inflation was pulled forward in the first quarter, but our full year remains sort of intact with our previous view. So I know that it's a complex, complex discussion to have. Just also makes it even more complex when we're trying to forecast the behavior of others in the channel where we don't have complete visibility. So it's -- frustrating, as it may be to you sometimes, we can't tell you what our goal for generic inflection will be for 12 months out. But frankly, it's a little bit of a black box for us as well, and have to make educated and informed estimates as to what we think will happen. And sometimes, those estimates are off either from a timing perspective or from a magnitude perspective. And what we're saying here is that really we're seeing some timing differences. But the magnitude, we think, will remain relatively the same.
James A. Beer: Yes. And that magnitude that we talked about when we offered the guide for fiscal '15 was high single-digit growth year-over-year.
Operator: And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions on our roster. Therefore, Mr. Hammergren, I will turn the conference back over to, sir.
John H. Hammergren: Thank you, Rufus, and thanks to all of you on the call and for providing some time today to listen to our results. I'm pleased with our strong first quarter performance. We're certainly excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us. I want to recognize the outstanding performance of all of our employees and their contributions to these great results. Now I'll hand the call off to Erin for her review of upcoming events for the financial community. Erin?
Erin Lampert: Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events for the financial community. On September 9, we will present at the Morgan Stanley Global Healthcare Conference in New York. On September 30, we will present at the Leerink Partners Healthcare Services Roundtable in New York. And on November 11, we will present at the Crédit Suisse Healthcare Conference in Phoenix, Arizona. We will release second quarter earnings results in late October. Thank you, and goodbye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining today's conference. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

(Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Erin Lampert:  Thank you, Talarie. Good afternoon and welcome to the McKesson fiscal 2014 fourth quarter earnings call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Thanks, and here is John Hammergren.
John H. Hammergren:  Thanks, Erin, and thanks everyone for joining us on our call today. We reported results for the fourth quarter and full year that reflect strong operating results across all of our businesses. For the full year, revenues were up 13% to $137.6 billion and adjusted earnings per share increased by 31% over the prior year to $8.35. Fiscal 2014 was a year of exceptional execution across McKesson. There are many areas to highlight, but to name just a few we saw tremendous performance in our generics business, including strong growth in our proprietary OneStop Generics program. We delivered solid results from the first full year of the PSS World Medical acquisition and met or exceeded all of our year one integration priorities. We expanded our long-standing distribution agreement with Rite Aid to include the sourcing and distribution of all of Rite Aid's brands and generic pharmaceutical requirements. And we secured the acquisition of Celesio in a disciplined manner and established a platform for McKesson as a global leader in pharmaceutical distribution. In addition to these terrific accomplishments, we've generated $3.1 billion in operating cash flow for the year another outstanding result. We successfully funded the acquisition of Celesio while maintaining a solid investment grade rating, and we invested $415 million in capital to support the growth of our businesses. I'm extremely proud of our accomplishments in fiscal 2014, and would like to take this opportunity to thank the employees of McKesson for their dedication to our customers and their constant focus on delivering exceptional value in all they do. Today, we also provided fiscal 2015 guidance of $10.40 to $10.80 per diluted share and expected year-over-year increase in adjusted earnings per share of 25% to 29%, reflecting strong growth across our broad portfolio of businesses and the expected full year results of our acquisition of Celesio. We are at an exciting time in the 181 year history of our company. We have a solid portfolio of growing businesses that are performing very well. We have the financial strength and discipline to continue to invest in the growth that we expect across our businesses and we've positioned McKesson as a leader in the global healthcare supply chain by expanding our success of leading global sourcing capabilities and direct relationships with our manufacturing partners to deliver value to our customers. Turning for a moment to the broader industry environment. As we entered this election year healthcare topics remained in the spotlight both at Federal and State level. The long anticipated implementation of the key provisions of the Affordable Care Act were launched in recent months and I believe we are only at the beginning of the evolution we should expect to see in healthcare in the United States for years to come. With full suite of capabilities to help our diverse customer base navigate change we are actively engaged in supporting them as they evolve their business. Pharmacies are increasingly positioning themselves as convenient alternative sites for primary care and offering services to patients to assist them in managing their health. Payers and providers are collaborating in innovative ways to design effective value based reimbursement programs that will slowly shift our fee for service based approach to a care delivery to our payment for value approach tied to outcomes delivered by providers. And consumers are more engaged in understanding the cost and quality of healthcare than ever before. We see more health plans and employers offering effective incentives for preventive care as well as wellness programs to help people with chronic conditions manage their own health. Our customers continue to seek solutions to help them thrive in this dynamic environment. This includes solutions for reducing their costs, navigating evolving payment models, meeting increasing regulatory requirements and improving the quality and the customer experience. McKesson stands unique in the industry for the depth of our knowledge and the insight and the challenges and opportunities our customers face. It is our comprehensive and solution-oriented approach that sets us apart as we focus on providing value for our customers and in return creating customers for life. Moving now to some of the business results for our fourth quarter and full year. Distribution Solutions had another excellent year driven by strong execution in all of our businesses. In fiscal 2014, Distribution Solutions' revenue increased 13% and operating margins increased by 31 basis points over the prior year to 2.39%. North American distribution and services, which includes our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, McKesson Specialty Health and McKesson Canada delivered strong results for the year led by outstanding performance in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. U.S. Pharmaceutical delivered tremendous growth in fiscal 2014 and led the strong expansion of our generics business. Our OneStop proprietary Generics program continues to deliver great value to our customers and we were pleased to see excellent growth during the year. More of our customers are buying more of their generics from McKesson, which also helped fuel the growth in our generic business in fiscal 2014. And as I mentioned earlier, we are extremely pleased with the trust and confidence that Rite Aid placed in McKesson by making the decision to expand their relationship with us to include the sourcing and distribution of all generic and brand pharmaceuticals, and I'm confident this agreement will deliver excellent value to both companies as we complete the transition over the coming months. In fiscal 2014, we've also continued to perform well for our branded pharmaceutical manufacturing partners and maintain steady levels of compensation in return. McKesson's global sourcing team continues to drive significant value for our Company and for our customers. Our team has developed innovative programs that help expand and foster strong partnerships with the best manufacturers across the globe. We are excited about the opportunities to continue to leverage this global sourcing capability as we expand our relationships going forward. And finally, I'd like to mention Health Mart. Health Mart continued its strong track record of growth during our fiscal 2014, ending the year with nearly 3,300 stores. Our U.S. Pharmaceutical business continues to deliver innovative programs and services to our community pharmacy customers, and we are proud of our growing and thriving Health Mart community of pharmacists. In summary, the U.S. Pharmaceutical team had an excellent year and I believe the business remains extremely well positioned for continued success. Our Canadian distribution business delivered solid revenue growth in fiscal 2014. We expanded our business in Canada by winning new customers and growing our business with existing customers. And even in a tough generic pricing environment, we continued to see solid contributions from our Canadian business through efficient management of our distribution network, growth and investment in our Canadian specialty business and a constant focus on our customers' success. Finally, our specialty business delivered solid financial results through growth across our broad portfolio of specialty solutions. We made steady progress in the growth of the number of physicians who are part of the U.S. oncology network, and we also grew our core oncology distribution and services business. We experienced solid growth in services for other multispecialty areas and strong adoption of our proprietary technologies for these specialist physicians. Last year at this time, we were talking about the impact sequestration cuts were expected to have on medical oncology reimbursement. U.S. oncology continues to grow despite this headwind. One of the great advantages of our model is our ability to work with our physician partners to drive productivity and clinical advances across our network and that makes U.S. oncology a great place for physicians and an excellent care setting for patients. Turning now to our results for international pharmaceutical distribution and services; upon achieving over 75% ownership of Celesio in February, we've begun to consolidate the financial results of Celesio into McKesson's financial results. Today, if you've seen our new reporting format, and going forward, the revenue results for Celesio reported and represented in our international pharmaceutical distribution and services line. I will remind you that while we've begun to consolidate the financial results of Celesio, we are still working through the domination process, which upon completion will allow us to begin to exercise operating control over the Company. We continue to believe that we will complete the steps required to register the domination agreement by the end of the first half of fiscal 2015. Upon achieving operating control of the Company, we can begin to work collaboratively with Celesio to implement our synergy plan. In the meantime, we've established a jointly staffed coordination office to begin important planning efforts in a number of functional areas. We are very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead with Celesio and at the same time, we are mindful of the hard work that is in front of us. In fiscal 2014, reported results include two months of revenue for Celesio and therefore our reported year-over-year growth in international pharmaceutical distribution and services will increase significantly throughout the year. That being said, for McKesson's fiscal 2015, we expect to underline full-year revenue growth of this business to be in the low single digits. Our medical-surgical business delivered strong results with 57% growth in revenues in fiscal 2014. The acquisition of PSS World Medical growth in our markets and terrific execution all contributed to this result. As I've mentioned all year, I've been extremely impressed with our team and the results they've delivered through the first year of the integration of this great business. Now as we look ahead, the team has begun an important phase of the integration which includes combining the distribution and IT infrastructure of the companies. We have ambitious plans that we think are very achievable for this phase of the integration and we have the best team in the business to carry it through to success. What has been most notable to me in this integration effort is our team's steadfast focus on ensuring we are providing the best value and most comprehensive set of solutions to our customers. For fiscal 2015, we expect revenue growth in the medical-surgical business to be in the mid-single-digits now that we have fully lapped the PSS acquisition. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with our full year operating performance in Distribution Solutions, and I'm confident this business is very well positioned for the future. As we look ahead to fiscal 2015, we expect that revenue in Distribution Solutions will increase significantly driven by the acquisition of Celesio, and we expect operating margins to expand toward the upper end of our long-term margin goal of 200 to 250 basis points. Turning now to Technology Solutions. For the year, Technology Solutions revenues were up 5% to $3.2 billion. Full year adjusted operating profit was up 25% to $467 million. I'm pleased to report that we made progress in a number of key areas, including delivering solutions for value-based reimbursement, helping customers optimize performance and analytics and business intelligence, and we're making advances now in our connectivity and data interoperability initiatives. During fiscal 2014 we saw a solid growth in of our connectivity and payer-facing businesses, which serve as the foundation for the investment areas I mentioned earlier. And we continue to work with our customers as they deal with delays and the expected implementation of ICD-10 and meaningful use standards. Looking forward to fiscal 2015, we expect Technology Solutions revenue will decline modestly year-over-year, as growth in our connectivity and payer-facing businesses will be offset by an expected revenue decline in other areas. We expect that operating margins in Technology Solutions will expand in fiscal 2015 to the upper end of our long-term margin goal of mid-teens. In summary, we remain committed to helping our customers use information technology strategically to better enable business, better care, and better connectivity. To wrap up my comments, I believe we have a strong plan as we enter fiscal 2015 to reflex growth across our broad portfolio of businesses, and capabilities of propelled McKesson, as a global leader in healthcare services. We're in the business that continues to generate strong cash flow from operations. We expect that our cash flow from operations will be approximately $3 billion in fiscal 2015. I'm confident in our team's ability to continue to deliver value to our customers and strong financial returns to our shareholders. We expect fiscal 2015 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $10.40 to $10.80. With that I will turn the call over to James for a detailed review of our financial results. James?
James A. Beer:  Thank you, John, and good afternoon everyone. As you've just heard, we are very pleased by the strength of our results this quarter and for the full year. We've had a great year of operating performance including strong growth in adjusted earnings per share, record operating cash flow, and the acquisition of Celesio. Looking forward, we believe our strategic and operational execution during fiscal 2014 will set the foundation for continued adjusted EPS growth. Today, I will cover both the fourth quarter and full year results. I will also present guidance for fiscal 2015. As a reminder, we provide our guidance on an annual basis due to the seasonality and the quarter-to-quarter variability inherent in many of our businesses. Before I begin, there are three aspects of our financial results for our fourth quarter and full year that I would like to bring to your attention. First, our fourth quarter and full year results reflect the consolidation of Celesio’s results for the two-month period ended March 31, 2014. In the fourth quarter and for the full year, McKesson's share of Celesio’s net income for the two-months ended March 31 was offset by a charge to cost of sales associated with a reversal of a step-up to fair value of Celesio’s inventory at the date of acquisition. Therefore McKesson's share of Celesio's results had no material impact on adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter and the full year. Second, as detailed on Schedules 3A and 3B, we have revised our revenue presentation for the Distribution Solutions segment. Celesio's revenues are presented within a new caption called international pharmaceutical distribution and services. Additionally, the results from our Canadian and U.S. pharmaceutical distribution businesses are now both included within a broader North America pharmaceutical distribution and services caption. This line also includes the revenues of our specialty business. Medical-surgical distribution and services business continues to be reported separately. Lastly, it is also important to note that Schedules 3A and 3B provide segment financial results for the fourth quarter and full year, but reflect 100% of the results of Celesio for the two months ended March 31 in accordance with U.S. GAAP. You'll recall that the non-controlling interest in Celesio is presented below our net income line as outlined on Schedule 1. Now let's move to our results. My comments today will focus on our full year fiscal 2014 adjusted EPS of $8.35, which excludes four items, the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, certain litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments. Now turning to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedules 2A and 2B, consolidated revenues increased 25% for the quarter and 13% for the full year to $137.6 billion. Adjusted gross profit increased 35% for the quarter and 26% for the full year to $8.6 billion, primarily driven by strong execution in our distribution businesses, market growth and our acquisitions of Celesio and PSS. Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.8 billion were up 50% for the quarter, driven mainly by our acquisition of Celesio. For the full year, excluding the impact of our recent acquisitions, total company adjusted operating expenses increased 5%. For fiscal 2015, we expect operating expenses will increase year-over-year driven by the acquisition of Celesio. Other income for the full year of $46 million was 35% higher than the prior year, primarily due to non-recurring gains in the fourth quarter. Full year adjusted interest expense increased to $28 million versus the prior year to $257 million. This increase was driven primarily by our acquisition of Celesio, including interest associated with our fiscal fourth quarter bond issuance of $4.1 billion, interest on debt used to initially finance the acquisition and interest on the debt acquired from Celesio. For fiscal 2015, we expect our year-over-year interest expense to be higher based on the new level of combined McKesson and Celesio debt. Now moving to taxes, for the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 35.2%. Excluding the impact of the Canadian revenue agency third quarter charge of $122 million, we ended the year with an adjusted tax rate of 31.2%. Our full year adjusted tax rate was lower than our expectations driven by favorable discrete tax items recognized during the fourth quarter that contributed approximately $0.11 to our adjusted EPS. Our share of Celesio's results during the quarter did not significantly impact our full year tax expense. Looking forward our fiscal 2015 outlook assumes an adjusted tax rate of approximately 31.5%. However this rate may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Adjusted net income for the full year totaled $1.9 billion and our adjusted earnings by diluted share totaled $8.35. Overall, this year's earnings per share benefited significantly from the strong performance in our U.S. pharmaceutical business specifically the favorable performance across our entire portfolio of generic pharmaceutical offerings. In addition, we realized a full year of contribution from our acquisition of PSS within our medical-surgical business. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 3% year-over-year to $233 million. This reduction was predominantly driven by $800 million in share repurchases completed late in our fiscal 2013. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding assumption for fiscal 2015 is $236 million. We have not planned for share buybacks in our FY 2015 plan. Particular FY 2015 capital allocation priorities include acquiring additional Celesio shares that may be put to us during our domination process and reducing our current degree of leverage, including planning for fiscal 2016 debt maturities. That being said, it is important to note that there has been no change to our historical portfolio approach to capital deployment, which includes a mixture of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. Let's now turn to the segment results, which can be found on Schedules 3A and 3B. Distribution Solutions total revenues increased 26% for the quarter and increased 13% for the full year. Revenue growth was driven primarily by acquisitions completed during fiscal 2013 and 2014 and from market growth. During fiscal 2015, we anticipate Distribution Solutions revenue growth will increase significantly driven by Celesio. North America Pharmaceutical distribution and services revenue for the full year increased 7%, driven primarily by market growth and our mix of business. For fiscal 2015, we expect North America pharmaceutical distribution and services to deliver mid-single digit revenue growth compared to fiscal 2014. During the fourth quarter and full year, we recognized $4.8 billion of Celesio revenue in our international pharmaceutical distribution and services line. This line includes 100% of Celesio's revenues for the two months ended March 31, 2014. For fiscal 2015, on a constant currency basis, we expect low single-digit growth in the underlying annual revenues of Celesio. Medical-surgical revenues were up 28% for the quarter and up 57% for the full year, driven by the acquisition of PSS. We continue to perform well against our three-year synergy business case. During fiscal 2015, we will continue our integration efforts while delivering mid single-digit revenue growth year-over-year. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit increased 30% for the full year on a 13% increase in segment revenues, resulting in a 31 basis point improvement in our adjusted gross profit margin year-over-year. As we look ahead to fiscal 2015, we expect continued adjusted operating profit growth for the segment driven by our acquisition of Celesio, further progress on PSS synergies and the contribution from our generic drug distribution and services businesses. Specifically, our generics businesses will benefit from increased generic launches, expanded one-stop sales and the breadth and depth of our global sourcing efforts. Adjusted operating expense for the segment increased 39% for the full year, driven mainly by our acquisitions of Celesio and PSS. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, our full-year Distribution Solutions adjusted operating expense was up approximately 6% versus the prior year. Distribution Solutions full-year adjusted operating profit increased 30% to $3.2 billion and we ended the year with an adjusted operating profit margin of 239 basis points. In fiscal year 2015, we expect high single-digit basis point growth in the Distribution Solutions operating margin. Turning now to Technology Solutions, revenues were down 1% for the quarter and up 5% for the full year to $3.2 billion as noted on Schedules 3A and 3B. Adjusted operating profit increased 138% for the quarter, primarily due to growth in higher margin revenues and the effect of $36 million in asset impairment charges taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. For the full year, adjusted operating profit increased 25% to $467 million. Our full-year adjusted operating margin was 14.67% increasing 227 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to a favorable shift in our mix of income. Adjusted operating expenses in the segment decreased to 10% for the quarter, primarily driven by impairment charges incurred in the prior year and increased 3% for the full year. Looking ahead to fiscal 2015, we expect Technology Solutions revenues to decline modestly year-over-year as growth in our payor facing and connectivity businesses will be offset by a revenue decline in our Horizon hospital software business along with the impact of eliminating a low-margin product line. During the coming year, we expect to achieve a mid-teens adjusted operating margin, in line with the high-end of the range for this previously articulated long-term goal. Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. Since only two months of Celesio’s results were included in the quarter and year, I’ll discuss our working capital metrics excluding Celesio. However, these metrics include the full year of results from our acquisition of PSS. For receivables, our days sales outstanding remained flat at 25 days. Our days sales in inventories decreased one day from the prior year to 32 days. Our days sales in payables increased to 53 from 51 days in the prior year. Our working capital metrics, along with our continued focus on cash generation, resulted in record cash flow from operations of $3.1 billion during our fiscal year. We ended the year with a cash balance of $4.1 billion, with $2.4 billion held offshore. Looking ahead, we expect cash flow from operations to be approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2015. Internal capital spending totaled $415 million for the full year, which includes Celesio spending of $15 million for the two months ended March 31. For fiscal 2015, internal capital spending should be between $575 million and $625 million, with the increase being primarily driven by Celesio. Before concluding my remarks, I would like to briefly review some of the important aspects of our acquisition of Celesio. As discussed during our third quarter earnings call, we launched a tender offer for the remaining outstanding common shares of Celesio during our fiscal fourth quarter. This tender offer closed subsequent to the end of our fiscal year and consistent with our expectations only nominally increased our ownership in Celesio to approximately 76% on a fully diluted basis. With greater than 75% ownership in Celesio, we continue to expect that we will secure operational control late in the first half of our fiscal 2015. The current fiscal 2015 adjusted EPS guidance contemplates the anticipated transaction accretion and the modest synergies that we expect to derive from Celesio in the coming year. It is important to note that in our fiscal 2015 guidance, we have assumed that we own 76% of Celesio. We have also assumed an exchange rate of $1.36 per euro. Now, before I conclude, I would point out that in today’s earnings press release, we detailed the key assumptions for fiscal 2015 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $10.40 to $10.80. As always, our plan includes certain risks, but overall, we are very pleased with our outlook for the coming year. Our plan provides strong adjusted EPS growth from our continued operational and strategic execution, and allows us to create significant value for our customers, manufacturing partners, and shareholders. Thank you. and with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Talarie?
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Steven Valiquette, UBS.
Steven J. Valiquette – UBS Securities LLC:  Thanks, good afternoon. Just a question on the generic price trends. You had that – there was a bullet in the slide deck or in the press release about price trends on generics outside the exclusivity periods expected to be in the high single-digits, and you’re saying that’s a decline from the trend in fiscal 2014. So I just want to make sure; firstly, you’re talking about growth there sort of declines, but also I think both of them I think are probably a lot higher than what I thought they were as far as the trend lines for fiscal 2014 and 2015. So I guess any additional color on what’s going on there would be definitely helpful? Thanks.
James A. Beer:  Well, as you say, the guidance that we have there in the press release talks about growth in FY 2015. It’s between the high-single-digit realm. Yes, that is lower than the percentage growth that we saw for generics that are past that exclusivity period that we saw in fiscal 2014. So, it is a relative headwind year-over-year, but still growth for fiscal 2015 year-over-year.
John H. Hammergren:  Steven, these are price trends, not the growth of the market overall. This is just the trend of price inflation on generics. So we do expect this year to be a good launch year for generics.
Steven J. Valiquette – UBS Securities LLC:  Okay. For the quarter just reported though, was there pretty consistent trends in the March quarter versus what you saw back in the December quarter sequentially or was there a little bit of tapering off on some of the economics tied to that? Just curious on the sequential quarterly trend.
John H. Hammergren:  Well, at the beginning of the year, we talked about the strength in the first half of the year and we expected that to moderate in the back half and that’s exactly what we saw in our third and fourth quarters.
Steven J. Valiquette – UBS Securities LLC: Okay, perfect. Thanks.
Operator:  We’ll move on to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa C. Gill – JPMorgan Securities LLC:  Thanks very much and good afternoon. John, I just want to make sure that I understood this correctly. Operational control late in the first half of 2015, but, just being conservative as far as the guidance goes on Celesio?
John H. Hammergren:  Well, the operational control is a technical accomplishment that has to be reached after a shareholder meeting and a bunch of other things that we have to do from a European perspective or German perspective. So that is proceeding as we have planned. There is no change in our forecast when we expected to achieve operational control. As you recall, we wanted to have the 75% threshold, which we thought would enable this to happen in the timeframe that we’ve outlined. We did pick up another percent in ownership from 75% to 76%, which is really also what we had expected. Our guidance that we talked about – we said in our guidance that Celesio was going to grow moderately this year including our first year modest synergies. So, I’m not quite sure what portion of our guidance you’re asking the question about. Is it the operational control, the ownership percentage or talk about the…
Lisa C. Gill – JPMorgan Securities LLC:  Yes. Maybe just trying to understand that a little more clearly. So, you are talking about the operational control first half of 2015, but you are saying that ownership is at 76%. At 76%, you don’t have operational control, isn’t that correct?
John H. Hammergren:  That’s correct. We have to go through a couple of more steps. We don’t believe there is any risk in us not obtaining operational control, but we don’t have it automatically just from ownership. We don’t need 100% to get operational control. So what will happen is, we’ll get this operational control, which will allow us to be more interactive with the company than we can today, because we still have a responsibility with regard to operational control to manage the business independent of McKesson and that will change when we achieve operational control. The difference between 76% and 100% ownership is just how much of the earnings we actually consolidated in the end and that’s what James was trying to describe. So we have 100% of the revenue in, we take out the minority ownership from an earnings perspective on that full schedule.
Lisa C. Gill – JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, that’s very helpful.
James A. Beer:  And I’d just add to that if I could, the attainment of operational control towards the end of the first half of fiscal 2015 that allows us to really get going on the synergy business case.
Lisa C. Gill – JPMorgan Securities LLC:  And then just so I understand when you look at for example Celesio reported today and may talk about the German market reimbursement economics getting better. Are those trends that you are going to talk to us about John or James going forward and what are your overall thoughts on those markets right now?
John H. Hammergren:  Well, it’s difficult for us to talk about their view of their markets until we get operational controls. So I think you should expect us to be more open and perhaps, discuss more freely what’s going on in the various businesses inside of Celesio and various markets inside of Celesio. Our view, I have spent a lot of time in Europe now with the country managers and I think Paul, and I both would share a point of view that business is run by professional managers we respect and admire what they are doing in many of their markets. And in their press release this morning, they did talk about the strength in their European pharmacy network activities and the strength in particular, Lloyds out of the U.K. and we certainly have seen some of that in our travels. I think it’s probably difficult for us to speculate at this point what will happen with the German discounting in the outside our end of our fiscal year, which is really what they are referring to.
Lisa C. Gill – JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thank you for the clarification.
John H. Hammergren: Yes.
Operator:  And next, we’ll move to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser – Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC:  Yes, hi, good afternoon. Some questions around the Rite Aid contribution, so how should we think of the ramp up for the Rite Aid distribution agreements throughout the year? Also, does guidance factor in improved economics to OneStop from your enhanced scale that comes with the Rite Aid contract?
John H. Hammergren:  Thanks for the question, Ricky. The guidance we’ve provided includes our entire outlook for the year. so it does include our view of the ramp-up of our relationship with Rite Aid. What’s great about the Rite Aid relationship for both Rite Aid and McKesson is that we don’t have any structural impediments to our speed to market and we were able to move very rapidly once that agreement was complete to work with our manufacturing partners to begin building momentum against the opportunity that lies ahead for all of us. I would say to you that I think we’re substantially complete now with the work that we need to do with manufacturers. As to the rollout of the service offering to Rite Aid related to distribution of generics, we’re very, very early in that process. We have only just begun the process of serving the Rite Aid stores or some of the Rite Aid stores with their generic requirements.
Ricky Goldwasser – Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC:  Is that something that will take your full fiscal year to achieve?
John H. Hammergren:  I think it will ramp up over the next half of the year. Next two to three months, we should be well into it.
Ricky Goldwasser – Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you.
John H. Hammergren: Yes.
Operator:  Next, we’ll move on to Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.
Glen J. Santangelo – Credit Suisse Securities LLC:  Hey John, I just want to follow up on the generic question. Essentially, given that the Celesio revenues are now sort of being consolidated and you’ve pulled Rite Aid into the fold, and I guess you answered this by suggesting that substantially you’ve completed all the work with the manufacturers. I guess what I’m kind of curious is, have you been able to take that incremental volume amount to the manufactures and start to renegotiate the terms of those agreements? And if you’re not, are you starting to see some benefits today and if not, how long will that ultimately take?
John H. Hammergren:  When I spoke about the Rite Aid implementation, the first step really was to bring the combined volumes of our corporations together and go to the marketplace to make sure that we are providing the best opportunity to the manufacturers to gain access to that share position. We are now in the process of implementing the generics actually into – the distribution business into Rite Aid, but the value for McKesson relative to the renegotiation should begin to be realized basically effective right now at the beginning of this fiscal year. I might note however that none of the Celesio synergies or volumes or generic purchases, et cetera have been included in any of this upfront work with the manufacturers. It’s simply been McKesson’s business that has continued to grow and thrive, including the incremental Health Mart stores we’ve added, as well as the increment of Rite Aid generic bind that we were able to put together and complete – as I said, substantially complete the negotiations with manufacturers as we sit here today. And clearly, as we get into the late summer months, we should be reworking those relationships to include the Celesio volume as well.
Glen J. Santangelo – Credit Suisse Securities LLC:  So James, and if I could just follow up on that Celesio accretion analysis. Essentially, when you guys first announced the deal, I think you suggested it’d be a $1 to $1.20 accretive and that was with very modest synergies. Now that you have76% ownership, should we think about that year one accretion being in the $0.75 to $0.80 range with only moderate synergies because based on John’s comments, it kind of sounds like the Company hasn’t been able to bring those volumes into the fold and start to really exercise some of that synergy potential at this point.
James A. Beer:  Well, we stand by the $1 to $1.20 of accretion for 100% of the ownership. Of course, as you say, we’re only at 76% and that was for the first 12 months of operations, after beginning of February. So in essence, we got the first two months of that in the Q4, just finished and then the balance of the 10 months, we’d be receiving in fiscal 2015. Now, the reason that we ended up net neutral in fiscal 2014 was because we had this one-time inventory write-up consistent with the acquisition accounting and so forth.
Glen J. Santangelo – Credit Suisse Securities LLC: Okay, okay. Thank you.
Operator:  Next, we’ll move to George Hill with Deutsche Bank.
George R. Hill – Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.:  Hey. Good afternoon, John and James. Thanks for taking the question, John; I don’t know if I missed – if I didn’t hear this properly. I didn’t hear NorthStar mentioned in the prepared comments. I guess, can you provide any color on how Northstar’s doing and when you’ll have the chance to provide NorthStar products to Rite Aid and Celesio?
John H. Hammergren:  We continue to make great progress with NorthStar and in fact, have launched a version of NorthStar that’s called, Savant in Canada. And so both of those product lines are continuing to gain momentum. Now, clearly, we’re working closely with the manufacturing community to make sure we’ve got the best choice of product and the best choice of partners and the Rite Aid agreement does include NorthStar as one of the value offerings to both companies. As it relates to Celesio, which is probably premature to talk about, what we might be able to do with NorthStar or with the NorthStar model as it relates to many of the markets in Europe, but we clearly will have that as part of our evaluation as we get into that next phase.
George R. Hill – Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.:  Maybe a quick follow-up. A couple of your competitors are using JV or GPO type structures for the procurement of generic drugs. Is that something that makes sense to do with the inclusion of Celesio, or is the straight integration just McKesson buying the drugs directly from manufacturers and selling through the – I guess, through the supply chain, is that the right way? I guess, I’m just trying to think about industry structure going forward? Thank you.
John H. Hammergren:  No problem, George. We don’t plan to have any JVs or any type of unusual structure to get access to the synergy we believe are possible, and there was no JV structure as it relates to Rite Aid, will not be one related to Celesio. It will be McKesson’s sourcing operation that does all of the work.
George R. Hill – Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you.
John H. Hammergren: Yes.
Operator:  We’ll move on next to Steve Halper with FBR & Company.
John H. Hammergren: Steve, are you on mute?
Operator: Mr. Halper, your line is now open.
Erin Lampert: Talarie, maybe, we’ll move to the next question.
Operator: Certainly, and we’ll move on to the next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company.
Charles Rhyee – Cowen & Co. LLC:  Yes, thanks. Can you guys hear me?
John H. Hammergren: Yes.
Charles Rhyee – Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. John, just going back to Celesio real quick. Obviously, you’re going to the core process. You talked about a jointly staffed coordination office. Can you talk about specifically what then – is this more focused on the integration itself, or is this, as other people have kind of asked, more towards how you approach manufacturers?
John H. Hammergren:  Well, it’s a little bit of both. A part of that coordination activity is to make sure we’re getting after the synergies that we think exist in the primary synergies we’ve outlined in our conversations regarding Celesio is around product sourcing. so clearly, that’s a top priority and those teams are already beginning to do some work. But as I said it really can’t accelerate until we get pass this operational control phase. With the other part of the project management or coordination office role is to make sure that we understand what Celesio is working on today and what they might need our assistance with, things like IT or other kinds of projects that we might be able to lend a helping hand to. So, I would say that it’s basically a process of understanding more completely Celesio’s operations and corporate functions, so that work is under way.
Charles Rhyee – Cowen & Co. LLC:  Great. And as a follow-up James. I don’t know if I saw it in the assumptions you gave on the guidance. Can you give us an estimate of, what sort of interest expense are you expecting for fiscal 2015? Thank you.
James A. Beer:  Yes. We would expect interest expense to be rising year-over-year, consistent with the new debt that we took on to finance Celesio. So that is all publicly available and so I’ll just leave at there at the moment.
Charles Rhyee – Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, thank you.
Operator:  We’ll move on to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert P. Jones – Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for the question. Just wanted to go back, John, if I could to the generic inflation assumption in guidance. I know this has been a tailwind if you will for the last several years. It seems like Distribution Solutions, I was just curious, how much visibility do you have into this variable and given that your expectations are for it to moderate a bit into fiscal 2015. Just wondering what the main drivers of that in your view could be?
John H. Hammergren:  Well, the inflation – just to remind the listeners, generics has been driven by a relatively small subset of the overall generic portfolio and a relative small subset of manufacturers. Like any other estimate that we have to make, whether it’s brand inflation or generic inflation or generic launches, et cetera, what we attempt to do is use the best resources we have internal to the company and whatever resources are available externally to create those views. I think we were correct on our assumption that it was going to moderate in the back half of this year, of fiscal 2014 which it did, and we believe the assumption we’ve given relative to FY 2015 is our best thinking as it stands today for what inflation will be. It certainly could be wrong, and the manufacturers don’t typically tell us what they’re going to do. One of the reasons we state our assumptions so clearly in our press release is, so those of you on the phone can create your own view of our assumptions, and provide that input into your own models as you reflect on what we’ve done. But we still think it’s going to be an important part of our 2015 performance. We expect it to still be very solid, and it just will be slightly less than we experienced in 2014.
Robert P. Jones – Goldman Sachs & Co.:  Got it. That’s helpful. And then just a quick follow-up within specialty. John, you continue to sound very pleased with the performance of U.S. oncology. I was wondering if you’ve seen a shift at all in the site of care within oncology treatment? Any pressure in the marketplace for oncology treatment to be done more in the acute care setting?
John H. Hammergren:  We do see that pressure. It ebbs and flows depending on the markets and where our physicians are based. I would say that the pressure is not coming from payers and it’s not coming from patients. The pressure is usually driven by the purchase of a practice where a local hospital or hospital system decides to buy a group of oncologists that were customers of McKesson. And many times if the hospital is a customer of McKesson, we’ll retain all of that business, clearly if it just go through standard distribution. But I think the beauty of the U.S. Oncology model is that, many times we’re able to follow those physicians into the hospital setting and begin to manage the practices on behalf of the hospital, maybe you pick up net new physicians that are part of the network as the hospital relies on our expertise to continue to work with those doctors to optimize the quality of care and the cost of that care. So, although it continues to be something we have to pay attention to, and on occasion we’ll lose a practice if a customer that goes into a hospital and we don’t have any affiliation with the hospital afterwards and obviously, that’s a net loss for us. But I would say the team has been very good at working with our customers in these transitions and retaining our position.
Robert P. Jones – Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks. 
John H. Hammergren: Yes.
Operator:  We’ll move on next to Greg Bolan with Sterne Agee.
Greg T. Bolan – Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.:  Thanks for taking the question. So just a few technical questions, James. Celesio, was it fair to say that it added about 700 basis points to total revenue growth in the fiscal fourth quarter?
James A. Beer:  Yes. It added about $8 billion in revenue in fiscal fourth quarter.
Greg T. Bolan – Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.:  Okay, got it.
James A. Beer: Yes.
Greg T. Bolan – Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, and then, I know obviously annual guidance is being given here and that’s historically been the case, but just as you think about how the first half of the fiscal year will gate into the second half, obviously you’ve got Celesio that will be coming on board from an earnings contribution perspective in the back half, as well as – well, I guess that was somewhat offset kind of a slight headwind from a little bit lower generic pricing increases. So, is it kind of fair to say, first half 45% of earnings and back half 55% of earnings, if we kind of think about the midpoint of guidance?
James A. Beer:  Well, just one thing I misspoke on the Celesio revenue that was $4.8 billion in Q4, not $8 billion.
Greg T. Bolan – Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: Got it, thank you.
James A. Beer: So in terms of the mix of earnings during the year, what I would point to is that last year, we had particularly strong earnings in the first half of the year, year-over-year and that was driven by somewhat unusually high generic price increase activity. So returning in our fiscal 2015 plan to more the profile that we saw in fiscal 2013 back through fiscal 2011 that type of picture in some quarterly seasonality.
Greg T. Bolan – Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: Okay, that’s very helpful. Thank you.
Operator:  We will move next to David Larsen, Leerink Partners.
David M. Larsen – Leerink Partners LLC:  Hi, congratulations on a good quarter. For the $1 to $1.20 in Celesio synergies, can you just describe what the nature of that is and would that be expected to be achieved after domination is realized? Thanks.
John H. Hammergren:  So that’s an accretion number, not a synergy number. The synergy number was $275 million to $325 million realized over four years, with a modest impact this fiscal year.
James A. Beer:  Yes. So the $1 to $1.20 of accretion is very largely just our share of Celesio’s earnings. Now again, that always assumed 100% ownership and we only own 76% of the shares at this point. So it’s important to factor that into account.
David M. Larsen – Leerink Partners LLC:  And then the driver of the synergies $275 million to $325 million, can you just talk about the nature of those please?
James A. Beer:  By far the most significant driver there are the purchasing synergies that we would look to be able to attain over time. As John said, we’d look to get to $275 million to $325 million per year by year four. So, it will really be that procurement synergy effort that drives that to some modest amount of tank savings that we believe will be available as well.
David M. Larsen – Leerink Partners LLC:  Great. Thanks a lot.
John H. Hammergren:  So operator, I don’t think there are any other questions on the phone. So, I think that we’ll wrap this up. I want to thank all of you on the call today for your time. We certainly have a strong plan in place for fiscal 2015 and we’re excited about the tremendous growth opportunities that are available to us across McKesson. I’m certainly once again; proud of our track record in our delivery to our customers and the tremendous financial returns we’ve delivered to our shareholders this year and for many years, and I also want to thank all of our tremendous employees for their effort this last year on driving that success for us. With that, I’ll turn it over to Erin for a view of upcoming events for the financial community.
Erin Lampert:  Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events. We will participate in the UBS Global Healthcare Conference in New York on May 20th and the Goldman Sachs Healthcare Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes on June 11th. We will release first quarter earnings results in late July. We look forward to seeing you at one of these upcoming events. Thank you and good-bye.
Operator:  And everyone, that does conclude our conference call for today. Thank you all for your participation.

Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.
Erin Lampert: Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson's Fiscal 2014 Third Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update and will then introduce James, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after 1 hour at 6 p.m. Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's current, periodic and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results: acquisition expenses and related adjustments, the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, certain litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for investors. Please refer to our press release announcing third quarter fiscal 2014 results available on our website for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thanks, and here's John Hammergren.
John H. Hammergren: Thank you, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. As you've seen in the press release we issued this afternoon announcing our third quarter financial results, we incurred charges related to 2 items which had a negative impact on our reported results for the quarter. I'll come back to these items in just a moment. I'd like to begin with 2 big headlines for the quarter. First, we had exceptional growth in our Distribution Solutions business where operating profits grew by 37% over the prior year. And we're also very excited to have secured the acquisition of Celesio through the agreements we announced last week. First, I'll begin with a few comments about Celesio. Last week, we announced that we reached an agreement with the Haniel Group to purchase their entire holding of Celesio common shares. In a separate and subsequent transaction, we also reached an agreement with an affiliate of Elliott management to purchase Celesio convertible bonds. The agreements with the Haniel Group and Elliott will result in McKesson achieving over 75% ownership of Celesio on a fully diluted basis. We expect to close these transactions on February 6, 2014. We are extremely pleased to move forward with the acquisition of Celesio, and we look forward to bringing together the strengths of the McKesson and Celesio organizations to provide our customers with even more efficient delivery of health care products and services around the world. While the path to securing this acquisition was certainly not what we had originally expected, it would seem that the interested parties to this transaction continued to see the compelling strategic benefit of McKesson and Celesio uniting to form a global leader in health care services. I never lost sight of the value this transaction will bring to our customers, our supply chain partners, the employees of both organizations and our shareholders. That being said, we made it clear from the time we originally announced the transaction on our second quarter earnings call that we would need to achieve the 75% ownership threshold in order to fully realize the value and synergies we had outlined. We also made it clear that we would be disciplined stewards of our shareholders' capital, and I'm pleased we were able to accomplish both of these important objectives. James will update the key financial elements of the transaction and provide additional information on the immediate next steps, but let me take a moment here to make a few things clear. First, our strategic rationale and key financial assumptions remain intact. Second, the combination of McKesson and Celesio will become the world's largest pharmaceutical supply chain company, and we'll be well-positioned to meet the increasing global nature of our industry. I'm extremely proud of the global sourcing capability McKesson has built over many years. We've been able to deliver tremendous value through our strong manufacturer relationships and our knowledge of the health care supply chain. This acquisition keeps McKesson's expertise at the center of our strategy and deepens our relationships directly with our manufacturing partners. And finally, McKesson has a great track record of deploying capital wisely, and the acquisition of Celesio continues this trend, creating a strong platform for growth, driving benefits for our customers, our manufacturing partners, our employees and our shareholders. Turning now to our results for the quarter. As I mentioned, Distribution Solutions continues to deliver exceptional results, and our view of the full year operating performance of the business has improved from our previous expectations. In our Technology Solutions segment, we continued to take actions to align our development efforts and resources to our customers' most important priorities and the realities of our marketplace. Our third quarter results include charges resulting from the restructuring actions related to the timing of our Horizon Clinicals software platform requirement to meet Meaningful Use 3. Our third quarter results are also impacted by a significant increase in our tax reserves. As disclosed in our recent quarterly and annual SEC filings, we've been engaged in a tax dispute in Canada regarding the transfer pricing matter for the years 2003 through 2008. McKesson has been in litigation regarding the assessments received for the tax year 2003. In late December, the Canadian Tax Court ruled against McKesson, and in January, we filed an appeal of this decision. While we believe the structure of our transfer pricing agreements were appropriate, we think it is prudent to record an increase in our current reserves for all Canadian open tax periods. So overall, for the full year, our outlook for Distribution Solutions has improved. However, we have updated our guidance for the fiscal year and now expect to achieve adjusted earnings per diluted share of $8.05 to $8.20 for our fiscal 2014, which include the restructuring charges in our Technology business and an increase in our tax reserves, which combined total $0.70. Before I turn the call over to James for a detailed review of our financial results, I'll provide some highlights from both segments of our business. As I mentioned, Distribution Solutions continues to deliver strong operating performance. In the third quarter, revenue grew 10%, and adjusted operating profit grew 37%. Within our Distribution Solutions segment, our U.S. Pharmaceutical business had another quarter of outstanding results. Direct distribution and services revenues increased 11% for the quarter. In the third quarter, we continued to experience price inflation in a relatively small subset of our generics portfolio. Consistent with the expectations we outlined in the second quarter, inflation in our fiscal third quarter moderated from what we had experienced in the second quarter. In addition, we continue to benefit from more of our customers choosing to buy more of their generics from McKesson and strong compliance to our generics programs and services, including strong growth in our OneStop and generic -- OneStop Generics program. In summary, we had another quarter of great performance in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. Revenues in Canada increased 12% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued growth in our core business and growth from new customers. Our Specialty business had another solid quarter of performance, and I'm pleased with the collaboration and innovation that's being driven between our physician partners and our specialty team. Our Medical-Surgical business had solid results for the third quarter. As we approach the 1-year anniversary of the acquisition of PSS World Medical, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all of the employees of the combined McKesson Medical-Surgical and PSS teams for the outstanding progress they have made in the integration of these 2 great businesses. While we still have significant work ahead of us in the coming years to optimize our distribution network, I'm proud of the way our teams have come together to implement our strategy, all while remaining focused on taking care of our customers. In summary, I'm pleased with the exceptional performance in our Distribution Solutions segment for the third quarter. We have leadership positions across all of our North American distribution businesses, including U.S. Pharmaceutical distribution, Canadian pharmaceutical distribution, community oncology distribution and services, and Medical-Surgical distribution, including physician office, home care and long-term care. And we're pleased to add a great new platform for growth on a more global scale through our acquisition of Celesio. Turning now to our Technology Solutions segment. In the third quarter, revenues grew by 6% to $784 million, and adjusted operating margins were 8.55%. While we are disappointed in the reported results in our Technology Solutions segment this quarter, it is important that we take action in response to the changes in the anticipated timeline for Meaningful Use 3 and to size our organization in Horizon Clinicals appropriately. I would point out, as the timelines for Meaningful Use 3 are delayed, we must maintain a certain level of resources to support our customers as they prepare for this important implementation. Another item which had an impact on our third quarter results and our outlook for the full year is that we had expected a recovery in demand, in particular in our Medical Imaging business. This recovery in demand has not yet materialized. You should expect to see us continue to take actions to align our organization and development efforts to our customers' most important priorities. Our customers are going through a significant change in the way they think about their business models going forward. McKesson will continue to focus on delivering solutions that help our customers drive better decisions through analytics and business intelligence, enabled connectivity and provide tools and services to support new risk-based and value-based reimbursement business models. In summary, it's an exciting time to be at McKesson. The performance in our Distribution Solutions business is strong, and our outlook for the full year operating performance has improved from our previous expectations. And our acquisition of Celesio positions us for leadership on a global scale. The combination of McKesson and Celesio is expected to have revenues in excess of $150 billion, approximately 81,000 employees worldwide and operations in more than 20 countries. We will deliver to approximately 120,000 pharmacy and hospital locations on a daily basis in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Brazil, including more than 11,000 pharmacies that are either owned or part of a strategic banner or franchise network of community pharmacies. With that, I'll turn the call over to James, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?
James A. Beer: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As you've just heard, we are pleased by the continued strength in our operating results. We're also very pleased to be moving forward with Celesio and expect that this acquisition will build upon the value we bring to our customers, manufacturing partners and shareholders. Today, I will walk you through our third quarter consolidated financial results, provide an update on our fiscal 2014 outlook and outline the key financial aspects of our acquisition of Celesio. As I review the third quarter, there are 3 aspects of our financial results that I would like to particularly bring to your attention. First and perhaps most important in thinking about our business going forward is the continued performance and strength within our Distribution Solutions segment. Second is a $122 million charge we recorded relating to a dispute with the Canada Revenue Agency, which we have described in our previous SEC filings. I will come back to this later in my remarks. And third, our $42 million in restructuring charges taken in our Technology Solutions segment, primarily related to our Horizon Clinicals software platform. My remarks today will focus on our third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $1.45, which exclude 4 items: the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, certain litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments. Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedule 2A. Consolidated revenues increased to 10% for the quarter to $34.3 billion. Adjusted gross profit for the quarter increased to 21% to $2 billion, primarily driven by the continued strength in our distribution business. Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.2 billion were up 13% for the quarter, driven primarily by the impact of acquisitions closed in fiscal 2013. For the full year, excluding the impact of these acquisitions, we expect total company adjusted operating expenses to increase approximately 3%. Other income year-over-year was slightly lower for the quarter at $5 million. Interest expense was approximately in line with the prior year at $59 million. Now moving to taxes. As outlined in our recent filings, we have been engaged in a legal dispute with the Canada Revenue Agency regarding a transfer pricing matter that impacts the tax years 2003 through 2008. The tax court released its decision on this matter late in our third quarter. And earlier this month, we filed an appeal of that decision to the Federal Court of Appeal in Canada. During our review of the court's decision, we reevaluated our existing tax reserves for all open tax years and recorded adjustments increasing these reserves by $122 million. We now expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be 36.5%, an increase from our previous estimate of 31%, driven by the current quarter Canadian tax reserve adjustment and a change in our mix of foreign and domestic income. Excluding the current quarter tax reserve adjustment, the adjusted full year tax rate would be 32.5%. Adjusted earnings for the quarter were $339 million, and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations totaled $1.45. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share this quarter were negatively impacted by $0.52 from the reserve adjustments related to the Canadian tax matter and by an additional $0.18 from the restructuring charges recorded at our Technology Solutions segment. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 3% year-over-year to 234 million. This year's earnings per share number was also aided by the cumulative impact of our share repurchases. We expect our full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding for fiscal 2014 to be 234 million. Moving now to our segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3A. Distribution Solutions' total revenues increased 10% for the quarter to $33.5 billion, primarily driven by market growth and more business from our existing customer base. Looking at the components, direct distribution and services revenues were up 11% for the quarter to $24.9 billion. Warehouse revenues decreased 1% for the quarter, primarily driven by a shift to direct store delivery. Canadian revenues on a constant-currency basis increased 12% this quarter from the prior year, mainly driven by market growth and recent customer wins. Turning now to our Medical-Surgical business. Revenues were up 67% for the quarter to $1.5 billion, driven by the PSS acquisition and market growth. The combined business continues to perform very well, as we made progress on important integration activities. Distribution Solutions' adjusted gross profit increased 27% for the quarter on 10% revenue growth, resulting in a 65-basis-point improvement in our adjusted gross profit margin. In addition to the PSS acquisition, our third quarter gross profit in Distribution Solutions benefited from continued favorable performance within our generics pharmaceutical business. Adjusted operating expense for the segment increased 19% for the quarter, primarily driven by the acquisitions we made in fiscal 2013. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 234 basis points, an improvement of 46 basis points versus the prior year. Based on our performance fiscal year-to-date, we now expect the adjusted operating margin for Distribution Solutions to be at the high end of our long-term adjusted operating margin goal of 200 to 250 basis points. Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were up 6% for the quarter to $784 million, primarily driven by our acquisitions. Now as I mentioned earlier, the third quarter results in Technology Solutions reflect certain business realignment and restructuring charges. Our businesses are continuously reviewing their outlook and strategic plans and allocating their resources to drive the best outcomes for our customers and our business. However, we do, on occasion, make decisions that have a more meaningful impact on our results. And therefore, we bring these to your attention. This quarter, our results in Technology Solutions were impacted by $42 million in business realignment and restructuring charges, driven by delays in the Meaningful Use 3 timeline and the realignment of our development efforts primarily related to the Horizon Clinicals software platform. $31 million of these charges reduced segment adjusted gross profit, while a further $11 million increased the segment's operating expenses this quarter. As a result, Technology Solutions' adjusted gross profit decreased 4%, representing a 453-basis-point decline in our adjusted gross profit margin. Adjusted operating expenses in the segment increased 12%, driven primarily by the acquisitions we made in the prior year, but also as a result of the impact of the current quarter restructuring charges. Technology Solutions' gross R&D spending for the quarter was $127 million, up 12% versus the prior year. Of this amount, we capitalized 6% versus 10% a year ago. Overall, third quarter adjusted operating profit for the segment was down 39% to $67 million, and the third quarter adjusted operating margin rate was 8.55%, a decrease of 636 basis points versus the prior year, driven largely by the charges I discussed earlier. Based on the current quarter restructuring charges and the rationale for these charges that John reviewed earlier, we now expect to be at the lower end of our long-term adjusted operating margin goal of the mid-teens. Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. At the end of the third quarter, our days sales outstanding was 24 days versus 25 days a year ago. Our days sales in inventories of 32 days was flat year-over-year, and our days sales in payables remained at 46 days. We generated cash flow from operations of $472 million. Overall, for the full year, we continue to expect that cash flow from operations will total approximately $2 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.4 billion, with $1.5 billion held offshore. Internal capital spending totaled $296 million for the first 9 months of fiscal 2014. We now expect full year internal capital spending to be approximately $400 million. Now I'll turn to our outlook. Let me once again remind you that our earnings this quarter were specifically impacted by 3 items that also affect our full year outlook. First, the dispute with the Canada Revenue Agency had a negative impact of approximately $0.52 per diluted share for the quarter and the full year. Second, the current quarter adjustments to our tax reserves and our change in income mix also drove an increase in our updated full year adjusted tax rate to 36.5% from our prior estimate of 31%. And third, the Technology Solutions charges lowered our adjusted earnings by approximately $0.18 per diluted share this quarter. As a result of these 3 items, we are updating our adjusted earnings guidance to a range of between $8.05 and $8.20. Also, to be clear, we have not included any earnings from Celesio in our updated fiscal 2014 outlook. We expect that the results from our acquisition of Celesio will not have a meaningful impact on our Q4 results. In addition, we expect to exclude from GAAP earnings $0.76 in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and $0.55 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. We also expect to exclude $0.23 for litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments of $0.71 to $0.77. Now let me take a few moments to talk about the acquisition of Celesio. McKesson expects to fund a portion of the transaction with offshore cash and has a bridge financing facility in place to fund the balance of the purchase price. As we consider our permanent financing plans, we remain committed to maintaining our status as an investment grade-rated company. We will begin to consolidate the financial results of Celesio during our fourth quarter, ending March 31, 2014, and our earnings will reflect [indiscernible] share of Celesio's earnings, although as I mentioned, we do not expect the acquisition will have a meaningful impact on our Q4 results. After the expected close of our agreements with the Haniel family and Elliott on February 6, 2014, we will exceed 75% ownership of Celesio's shares on a fully diluted basis. We plan to launch a tender offer for the remaining outstanding common shares of Celesio in our fiscal fourth quarter, and we continue to expect that we will have operational control of Celesio late in the first half of our fiscal 2015. Just to remind you, getting to operating control of Celesio, also known as a domination in Germany, is the point in time when we expect to begin executing on our synergy business case. By the fourth year, following the completion of the required steps to obtain operating control, we expect to realize annual synergies between $275 million and $325 million. We estimate this transaction to be $1 to $1.20 accretive on an adjusted earnings basis in the first 12 months following the completion of the transactions with the Haniel family and Elliott. This range, however, assumes 100% ownership of the outstanding common shares of Celesio and thus will have to be adjusted in line with our actual ownership stake in Celesio at different points in time over the coming months. Overall, our assumptions for accretion and synergies from this acquisition remain unchanged. In summary, we recorded 3 very strong quarters this year, and we are excited to move forward with our acquisition of Celesio and expect the transaction to deliver tremendous value to our customers, manufacturing partners and shareholders in the years ahead. Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.
Glen J. Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: John, I just want to follow up on some of the comments you made in your prepared remarks. It seems you suggested that maybe the generic inflation moderated a little bit in fiscal 3Q versus 2Q, but yet the magnitude of the beats out of the pharmaceutical segment continue to get bigger. And so I'm wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more, give us a little bit more color, about maybe what in the business maybe did much better than you would have thought given that moderating inflation -- generic inflation?
John H. Hammergren: Well, we were really pleased with the performance of the Distribution Solutions segment in the quarter, and we continue to have strength, really, across the board. You saw nice revenue growth in the business. Clearly, the PSS integration is going well for us, which has been additive to the performance in that business, but the real strength is really coming still out of our generics business. Our OneStop revenues were up nicely. The share of wallet we're getting from our customers who are relying more and more on our generic capabilities and now depending on us to source the right products at the right price for them has been very helpful. And clearly, the position we have with those manufacturers continues to improve. I think we've really built very positive, trusting relationships. And inflation continues to be an important part. So it's too early to call it trend change in generic inflation, but clearly, some moderation has occurred and it's been helpful. And it's still positive relative to our original expectations.
Glen J. Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And maybe just one quick follow-up. If I look at sort of what you're implying now for the fourth quarter based on your updated guidance, it looks like about $2.26 to $2.41 in the fiscal fourth quarter, which is lower than consensus. And the reason I bring it up is because on one of your competitors' conference calls, they seem to suggest that there were some price inflation that was maybe moved from the March quarter into the December quarter, and so I'm kind of wondering, was there anything that might have been -- that you might have recognized a little bit earlier than you otherwise would have? Is there any difference in the typical seasonality of these 2 quarters?
John H. Hammergren: I don't think we saw a lot of changes in the way that branded manufacturers behaved in our portfolio, the way we've established our agreements. Having said that, there may have been some slight move into our third quarter and out of our fourth quarter. I think that our -- we clearly believe that the inflation moderation is going to continue as we look into our fourth quarter, and we also have some follow-on expense in our MTS segment, as I talked about in our -- in my prepared comments. This Meaningful Use 3 thing for us is -- it was a real critical change. It pushed out our customers' implementation and we were able to, through the charge, reduce a significant amount of the investment we had sitting there, waiting to do these service implementations with our customers. But there is still remaining investment built in services and in R&D as we try to prepare ourselves for whenever the MU3 thing gets put in place for us. So I think it's a combination of sort of that moderation on the generics side to some degree in the fourth quarter, as well as the MTS business will have this kind of follow-on expense associated with MU3 and some other things that we've got going on there.
James A. Beer: The other thing I would just add to that is, of course, tax rate that I mentioned for the full year. We are looking at that 36.5% tax rate. So you have to bear that in mind as well.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Can you share with us kind of like what has been the feedback from your customers in the acquisition of Celesio? And I know, John, you talk about increasing generic wallet of customers. But are you seeing increased appetite from customers to historically source the bulk of their generics directly from manufacturers to strategically do more with McKesson?
John H. Hammergren: Well, we've been actively working for almost a decade on helping our customers realize the value, both from our sourcing, as well as our logistics efforts, and we believe that we are sourcing as well now as almost any one, and Celesio is going to help us improve even more, as we add that volume. And in particular, the retail footprint that, that brings along with it. I think the dynamic with our customers is also a focus on how to get supply chain efficiency. And [Audio Gap] wholesale channel is not -- has not proven to be the most logistically favorable way to do it. There's added costs on not only the buying and procurement side, but you could also certainly envision the increment of cost when it goes into our customers' warehouses, and then they have to handle the product and get it back out, when we're already in those stores every day, anyway, with the delivery of the other product that we have been selling them. So I think there's an increased appreciation at the executive level within our customers to look at those costs and to look also at the changing global world of generic sourcing and increased interest in focusing on McKesson. And I think what's great about the relationship that we've created here with the acquisition of Celesio, is it allows us to continue to have tremendous transparency into the supply chain. It gives us really total control of our own destiny, and it allows us to maintain those close partnerships with our manufacturing partners so that we can continue to have visibility to the opportunity, bring those opportunities to our customers and present them in a way that is compelling relative to them moving their internal sourcing of generics over to McKesson.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then the one follow-up is regarding the Ranbaxy plant import ban. How do you view the ban? How does it impact your view of generic price inflation? I know that you talked about some moderation, but does that -- could that change the trends?
John H. Hammergren: I guess, Ricky, I would remind you that McKesson has a very large generics portfolio consisting of thousands of products. And to put this inflation thing into context, the inflation is really coming from a very small subset of our total portfolio of products and a small subset of the manufacturers. With regards to Ranbaxy, I believe the industry is well aware of the work the FDA has been doing. They've increased their funding and their staffing to do critical inspections, and although I certainly feel bad for the Ranbaxy folks relative to this, I think McKesson is aware of this increased scrutiny and trying to make sure that we are availing ourselves of a wide enough supply chain so that we have access to the products. And I do not expect any of the recent situation with one of the Ranbaxy plants in India to have an impact on our delivery to our customers, nor an impact on our view of inflation going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tom Gallucci with FBR.
Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Just curious, we get a lot of questions on the generics and the price inflation and the impact and sort of how it flows through. Can you help us understand a little bit the extent to which you're seeing benefits from more -- by whole type pricing? Or is it that the same percentage spread on a bigger dollar amount gives you some more earnings? And I guess where I'm going with it is, to what extent, when price inflation moderates -- is it just sort of lack of upside? Or do you actually have to -- a negative that you have to overcome year-over-year because the earnings actually get lower in dollars?
John H. Hammergren: Well, we've seen a trend over time with generic pricing. It used to be a deflationary headwind we had to deal with year-on-year. And as that began to moderate, it clearly made the year-on-year effect easier. With an inflation environment like we experienced this year, clearly, it was a surprise to us that this would occur to the magnitude that it has. And as you think about our thinking going forward, it could provide a headwind for us, depending on what your view of ongoing generic inflation might be. Clearly, the offsets to that will be to get more and more folks buying off of our generic portfolio. Additional offsets will be the power of what we're doing with Northstar and our sourcing there. And clearly, our global sourcing initiatives are going to get additional fuel or accelerant as we put the Celesio teams together with the McKesson teams to approach the market on a global basis. And also, as you think about FY '13, we have a brand-to-generic trend that moves in our favor again. This was really the lull year for generic conversions, and I think, as you think about next year, we'll see that pick back up again.
Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Right. Right. And I have a follow-up to that actually. I think you started to mention it. You've said for a few quarters now that you're seeing more generics business from your existing customers. Can you frame that potential in terms of what's left on the table there, in any way, for us to get an understanding of where you've been and maybe how much more there is to go if more and more customers were, in fact, to move more of their business to you?
John H. Hammergren: Well, we have a great book of business, and we have been able, over the years, to take a great deal of the responsibility for delivering generics to our independents on -- is one of our key requirements. As you know, Tom, you've been following us for some time, we've been moving up the food chain with bigger and bigger customers testing us from a generic perspective and coming to the conclusion that we do in fact do the best job for them relative to generic pricing and generic service and generic availability. I think that, that movement is continuing. Our very largest customers still purchase generics on their own. And clearly, that would be a very large opportunity for us as we continue to build a compelling vision for what that might mean for them.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ross Muken with ISI Group.
Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Yes. I was curious just in terms of the cash flow and sort of where we are. It seems like it's pretty back half -- 4Q weighted for the year. How did that sort impact how you're thinking about the financing mix for Celesio? Obviously, we saw you raise the bridge, but we're -- I'm just curious in terms of -- in the new or old, I guess, guidance assumption, what is the sort of backbone behind that just in terms of percent from new debt versus cash on hand? Because, obviously, you have a portion in Europe.
James A. Beer: Yes. Certainly, the fourth quarter is traditionally a strong operating cash flow quarter for us, in part as a result of the timing of a lot of the brand price increases that we traditionally see. So in terms of the financing for Celesio, we have the view that we would have at least $1 billion or so of cash available offshore, and then we would obviously draw on the bridge for the balance of our needs, those needs, of course, are dependent upon the timing of the remaining 25% or so of the Celesio shares that we acquire. So we'll see how we play out in terms of that remaining 1/4 or so of the shares. That will help us define the eventual amount of permanent debt that we would put in place once we pay off the bridge.
Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Great. And maybe, John, you touched upon obviously over time, as these generic relationships develop, the potential to touch more of your large customers. But I'm curious, with all the new relationships in industry, what are you seeing from the independents, which has obviously been a core strength of yours for years? And how are they sort of reacting to all of these new arrangements and sort of the potential for them to possibly participate in new services? I guess this is now going to be true for you both here and in Europe.
John H. Hammergren: The independents in both Europe and here in the United States have been very positive about the announced Celesio acquisition, and now they're even more positive on the view that it's going to close here in a few weeks. And I think they believe that not only will they be able to enjoy continued great service and price on generics, but there are obviously tremendous retail experience that comes with Celesio, through the management of Lloyds Pharmacies, as well as the many banner stores that they support throughout Europe to continue to find ways to bundle our capabilities effectively for our independent customers. I'd also point out that none of our customers in Europe or here see the merger of McKesson and Celesio as a conflict of interest on their side. They don't feel threatened by it. They don't see it as something that's against their ultimate goals, and they don't see it as a competitive action in any way. So I think from a discussion perspective, we don't have any conflict of interest relative to what our motives are. And I think they continue to look at this in a favorable way, Ross.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: A lot of talk today about generic inflation. Can you maybe just give us any color as far as brand price inflation you saw in the quarter and expectations for the March quarter? We've heard some talk about the fact that some things may have been pulled into the December quarter. Did you see something similar? And how should we think about it in the March quarter?
John H. Hammergren: I would say that our view in the quarter was pretty consistent with our going-in thoughts as we developed our plans for the year. So I -- given that it hasn't been brought to my attention and when I asked the question to our team, there might have been some nominal changes in behavior. But as a portfolio, the price really came in close to what our expectations were.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, great. And then secondly, in Canada, obviously you called it out, it was up 12%. You talked about customer, as well as market growth. Can you maybe just talk about how much of that came from market growth? Are you seeing substantially more market growth there than we're seeing in the U.S.? And if so, what are the key drivers to that?
John H. Hammergren: Well, clearly, we have picked up a bunch of new customers in Canada, and we've been very selective on those new relationships. One of our competitors exited Canada through the sale of their business to another competitor in Canada, and some of the customers that were serviced by that competitor were open to a conversation with McKesson. And as a result, we've been able to grow our business. I might also say that our specialty business in Canada, which we believe is market-leading, continues to grow very nicely. And so we've been encouraged by that continued penetration in that part of our book.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Is there a way to look at the 12%, how much came from the new customers versus the overall market in Canada?
John H. Hammergren: It's probably difficult to parse out, Lisa. There are public numbers on market growth rates in Canada, but I think, clearly, we believe that we've had a significant increase in revenue as a result of our customer wins in the Canadian marketplace.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with UBS.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I just have a quick question on the March quarter as well. If I'm doing the math right, I think the implied fourth quarter guidance is $2.26 to $2.41 and straight to $2.46 right now. But again, with all the details in the press release and the commentary on the call, is there anything that's sort of one-time-ish in nature that you're including in the upcoming March quarter that's kind of baked within that quarterly guidance in particular? Or is that sort of more of a clean range the way things stand right now, just in relation to taxes or IT charges or even charges tied to Celesio as well?
James A. Beer: No. There's nothing that we're implying as to the fourth quarter or one-time nature or anything like that. Really, the 3 drivers I would ask you to really focus are obviously the Canada tax, $0.52; the technology charges of $0.18; and then the impact of the tax run rate, which is both partly driven by that Canada tax item, but also as a result of a change in our income mix with distribution business representing a greater proportion of the total profitability of McKesson.
Operator: Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: John, obviously we've talked a bit about your generics program here. And when you look at sort of the partnerships that have formed, yours is obviously a little different because you're basically owning Celesio. But as you think in the future and serving [ph] your large customers, do you envision more that they'll just join your -- they'll just become a customer of your OneStop program? Or could it end up being where you're partnering more in a JV format? Like how do you envision -- what would be your preferred route, and how would you kind of see it? Or do you even see the need to do that?
John H. Hammergren: Charles, that's a good question. I think the way I think about it is that the -- first of all, you see through these combinations that scale really matters and that wholesalers really matter. We are an integral part, even in the largest customer set, of the value proposition and the service offering that's brought to the marketplace. So I think the industry overall and wholesaling has done a very good job of continuing to add significant value. And changing our model over time so we remain vibrant and viable and in the middle of a very important industry and earn our position every day. I would say, relative to structures, we have not had great success at McKesson creating joint ventures that are sustainable, that -- where interests are always combined and unified. And usually, we end up with a situation where they collapse under their own complexity or they have some problem with one venture partner trying to optimize against another. So we're not really inclined to enter joint ventures, although I'd say that -- with the caveat of clearly, we'll listen to the opportunity and make a decision. I would say that with respect to our largest customers, we hope to continue to evolve our value proposition so that the economics that are afforded to them through our OneStop program or through custom-developed programs, that they'll buy off of our portfolio and that, that transaction will make sense for us and for them without the complexity of some type of a venture structure which could be difficult to manage.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: And if I can just follow up, your largest customers that do buy direct -- I mean, we generally assume that they buy all the generics direct. Is that really the case? Or is that they're buying sort of high-value generics directly and maybe low-value generics through you?
John H. Hammergren: I can only speak for McKesson's large customers. I would say that without exception, they all buy some generics from us. Given the frequency with which we deliver to the stores, our position has always been to help our customers from a service perspective. Clearly, many of them have their own warehouses and do their own buying as well for certain sets of products. And how they reach a decision as to which they buy for themselves and which they buy through us may not be totally transparent to us. I would assume it would usually be from an economic perspective, they would make that decision. Our job is to wrap the value proposition of our complete relationship with the customer, which should include brand, generic, our service offering, our automation systems, our warehousing capabilities, to make it compelling for them to discontinue their own purchasing. And we've been effective at doing that all the way up to our largest customers. And I think that it's our responsibility to continue to evolve our programs so we can earn the privilege of serving their needs from a generic perspective in a more holistic way.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.
George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: John, first one for you is can you detail for us, with the generic inflation that's been going on, how is Northstar leveraged to that? So has that been an excess margin opportunity for Northstar? And maybe the opportunities for Northstar in Europe?
John H. Hammergren: Thanks, George, for the question. Northstar clearly is around the globe looking at opportunities to bring product into our supply chain. And I think that the visibility we get through Northstar enhances our view of the opportunities that exist globally for us, as well as some of the challenges that may exist, whether it's plant closures, limited supply of raw materials or other issues that may come along. And I think that Northstar experience helps inform all of McKesson from a sourcing perspective in a very positive way. We have launched a variant of Northstar into Canada with success, and that product continues to build its position in Canada, that product line. And I believe, and so do our new partners at Celesio, that there are opportunities to explore with our generic portfolio in Europe. And clearly, Northstar will be a part of that.
George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And, James, maybe just 2 quick housekeeping questions. I want to make sure I heard things right. With the 36.5% tax rate you mentioned, was that for the fourth quarter? Or is that what we expected the full year rate to be?
James A. Beer: Yes, that's the rate for the full year, and that includes the impact of the Canadian tax matter that I talked about.
George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just -- as you guys launch the tender process for the remainder of Celesio, how long does that tender process go on for? And then maybe just a very simple explanation of next steps?
James A. Beer: Yes. The tender process we're doing -- envisage taking about 4 weeks, and then you'd have an additional 2-week period, very similar to actually the structure of the original tender, whereby additional people could tender their shares during that extra 2-week period. And then we have already issued our intent to go through a domination hearing. That will take some time. There are a few steps that we have to go through to be able to get to that hearing. First of all, we have to go through a valuation process. And then we also have to give 6 weeks' notice to call an annual general meeting at which the domination process would be heard. So that will take a few months, but we would still expect to be on track to reach domination towards the end of the first half of our fiscal 2015. And of course, it's at that point in time where we can really start work on the synergy case. That's the point of time in which we have operating control of Celesio.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink Swann.
David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: John, can you touch on how simple or perhaps complex it might be for the combined buying power of both McKesson and Celesio to operate across borders? Will that be a fairly simple process? And then can you also touch on the pricing environment in Germany?
John H. Hammergren: Thank you, David, for the questions. I think that it's probably difficult to characterize the 14 countries in Celesio's book in one way. I would say it really matters which country you're thinking about relative to the way generics are purchased today, how they're contracted for, whether the payers are involved or the government is involved. I would say that we've carefully mapped out the positions by country, by manufacturers. We understand where we think these synergies might fall for us. And clearly, our guidance to synergies and how we talked about it when we first announced the deal, all of those factors remain in place. So I think that -- we believe there are places where we can go across the borders with a more unified approach. And I'm sorry, David, I forgot the second question you asked.
David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: And then just in Germany, the pricing environment in Germany. Any challenge there? Any headwinds?
John H. Hammergren: That's another good question. Our German operation or the German operation under Celesio in that market has -- there has been public discussion about the wholesaling pricing in that market, just to be clear about what pricing -- at least I think I'm talking about. The wholesalers in that market have been in a competitive battle with each other for some time. I think that the Celesio people, on their last public conference call, characterized it as stabilizing but not improving. I don't think I want to make any additional comment other than that. But clearly, that's what their view was the last time they spoke publicly about it.
David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: And then I saw you had a press release on a relationship with RedBrick. Can you maybe just comment on what that will provide to McKesson's clients?
John H. Hammergren: Well, it's in our Technology business, and I have to say, it's a relatively small part of our portfolio. We do think it's important. We've been impressed with what the Redbrick people have to provide, but it won't really be anything material for McKesson at our scale.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Yes. Just understanding that we'll get formal guidance next quarter, I was wondering, John, maybe if you could share a little bit how you're thinking about the operating margin range, considering this year sounds like we'll be towards the upper end of the 200- to 250-basis-point range. Just trying to get a sense of how much of the drivers of the performance or outperformance this year do you think directionally are sustainable as we think about next fiscal year. And this is x Celesio, of course?
John H. Hammergren: Sure, Robert. Thank you for the question. We have not contemplated our guidance for next year yet. As you know, we'll do that when we report our fourth quarter results in April. I believe that -- our view, however, as a company is that margin expansion is a priority. And clearly, as you see the P&L flow this quarter, we like to grow revenues in line with the market, or maybe faster if we can get a bigger share of our customer's spend, which is what we've been focused on with our generics. We like to get a very positive drop to our gross profit lines by managing our pricing carefully in the marketplace. So we are not giving it all away. And then clearly, we want to manage our expenses very carefully as well so that we can drop it to the bottom line. And that's what delivers a great business and a great business model. I see no reason to believe that we can't continue to focus on gross margin as a top priority. I don't see any negative mix change occurring in our business, and I think generics continue to be a propellant across the board if you think about our sourcing. And if you think about next year, we have another brand-to-conversion cycle, which will be helpful to us from a margin expansion perspective. It remains a priority. And as we -- hopefully, as I keep telling Paul Julian, when you get past the 250, we'll come up with a new goal for you, which he's always excited to discuss.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: That's fair. I guess just if I could flip one in on Medical, not to be lost, obviously, good results there as well this quarter. Understanding PSS has been a big part of the contribution of growth this fiscal year, we start to lap that next quarter. I was wondering if you could just give us a sense of what you're seeing on underlying growth within the medical business and what your expectations might be in that segment going forward?
John H. Hammergren: I'm glad you brought up PSS. We have just a terrific franchise -- or I should say Med-Surg. We just have a terrific franchise and completing the PSS acquisition was an important step to market leadership in almost all -- in fact, all of the segments that we serve now in Medical. That integration is going very well. You saw the strength in the revenue, but I believe that those businesses' underlying growth, setting aside the acquisition, are all growing at or above the marketplace. And those are places where our value proposition really stands unique, and I think we have the ability to continue to grow share in home care, long-term care and our physician office business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: John, how quickly can you proceed with an acquisition strategy for Celesio to really expand that platform? Do you have to wait a couple of years? Or is it something instantaneously you can put in place?
John H. Hammergren: An acquisition on top of Celesio, is that what you were asking?
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Yes, building out the European or Latin American markets, wherever you might choose to go.
John H. Hammergren: Well, it's probably a little premature for me to speculate on it, given that -- I think we need to do a close diagnostic on what position we are in, in each one of these markets and how well we're positioned to take on additional work in those markets. Celesio is a composite of 14 countries that are all managed in a very discreet way, and I would think each one of these countries should provide additional opportunities. So we have both an execution challenge we'd have to understand if we were to bring on additional acquisitions. And clearly, we have a balance sheet constraint that we've put in place that says we're not going to lose our investment grade, and we're going to manage our cash flow very carefully. So with those 2 caveats, I think we're open to acquisitions, into doing things, but we're not going to do it in a way that disturbs our integration plans at Celesio, and we're not going to do it in a way that would integrate -- or risk our investment grade rating.
Operator: And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
John H. Hammergren: Great. Thank you, Lisa, and thanks to all of you for being on the call today. I'm really pleased with the operating performance of our business and excited about the future and our acquisition of Celesio. We're bringing on a great management team, a great group of employees and a great asset that will help us really build our company as we go forward. And I look forward to welcoming those teams as I travel throughout Europe in the next several months. This platform is important to us, and it's important to our customers. I'm now going to hand the call off to Erin for her upcoming review of upcoming events.
Erin Lampert: Thank you, John. I have a preview of an upcoming event for the financial community. On February 25, we will present at the Citi Global Healthcare Conference in New York. We will release our fourth quarter earnings results in early May. Thank you, and goodbye.
Operator: And that concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the McKesson Corporation Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded, and if you have any objections, you may now disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.
Erin Lampert: Thank you, Mary. Good morning, and welcome to the McKesson's Fiscal 2014 Second Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and I'm delighted to welcome James Beer, McKesson's recently appointed Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will provide the business update, who will then introduce James, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after 1 hour at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results: acquisition expenses and related adjustments, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, certain litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for investors. Please refer to our press release announcing second quarter fiscal 2014 results available on our website for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thanks, and here's John Hammergren.
John H. Hammergren: Thank you, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Late last night in the West Coast and early this morning for those of you on the East Coast, McKesson announced our agreement to acquire Celesio for a total consideration of approximately $8.3 billion. McKesson and Celesio will unite to form a global leader in healthcare services. Many of you are quite familiar with Celesio, but for those of you that are not, I want to take a moment to introduce you to this great company. Celesio is a leader in pharmaceutical wholesaling with a presence in key markets across Europe and Brazil and an extensive network of retail pharmacies that are either owned or a part of a strong collaboration model throughout Europe. This transaction brings together the strengths and expertise of 2 leaders in global healthcare with complementary geographic footprints, shared values and a history as a trusted partner to customers dating back approximately 180 years. The United States, Canadian and European healthcare services markets have been experiencing a number of forces driving change across healthcare delivery. Demographics are driving increased utilization. Governments and other payers are demanding more efficient and effective delivery of care, and consumers are more engaged in all aspects of the care continuum driven by access to information. In response to some of the larger forces for change in healthcare, the industry has evolved rapidly, marked by convergence between segments and increased globalization. The combination of McKesson and Celesio will be well positioned to meet the increasing global nature of the pharmaceutical supply chain and continue to enhance our customers' ability to deliver better and more efficient healthcare services. We are very excited about this transaction and the value it will bring to our customers, our supply chain partners, the employees of both organizations and our shareholders. Customers will benefit from increased supply chain efficiency, enhanced global sourcing and a broad array of innovative technology and business services. Our manufacturing partners and suppliers will benefit from access to new markets and the efficiency of a global distribution partner. And the employees of McKesson and Celesio will benefit from being part of an even stronger and larger global company. So let me take a moment to walk through some of the important elements of the agreements we have announced today. McKesson will acquire the Haniel Group's entire stake in Celesio, representing approximately 50.01% of the outstanding shares of the company for EUR 23 per share in cash. McKesson has also agreed to launch parallel voluntary public tender offers for the remaining publicly traded shares and outstanding convertible bonds of Celesio. This transaction has been approved by McKesson's Board of Directors, the Haniel Group's Supervisory Board and Celesio's Supervisory Board. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and certain closing conditions, including the acquisition by McKesson of a minimum of 75% of the shares of Celesio on a fully diluted basis. James will provide more color on some of the financial elements of the transaction in his remarks, but I would highlight a couple of things. First, the value and synergy in this transaction will happen over time. By the fourth year, following the completion of the required steps to obtain operating control of Celesio, we expect to realize annual synergies between $275 million and $325 million. To give you a sense of the strength and scale of the business, the combined company is expected to have annual revenues in excess of $150 billion and more than 81,500 employees worldwide, along with operations in over 20 countries. The business will report to Paul Julian, Executive Vice President and Group President of McKesson Distribution Solutions. Paul has skillfully led the Distribution Solutions segment of McKesson for the past 13 years, where he has overseen a period of tremendous revenue growth and profit expansion in our distribution businesses. These businesses have risen to become leaders in their markets, driven by Paul's focus on operational excellence and building the best leadership team in the industry. In summary, we have a great track record of deploying capital wisely, and the acquisition of Celesio continues this trend. The acquisition creates a strong platform for growth, driving benefits for our customers, our manufacturing partners, our employees and our shareholders. Before I move on to our business results for the quarter, I want to take a moment to welcome James Beer to his first quarterly earnings conference call with McKesson. It has certainly been an exciting few weeks since James joined the company earlier this month, and I'm delighted to have an executive of his caliber and experience to lead our finance organization. James has enjoyed a successful CFO tenure at 2 prominent organizations, American Airlines and Symantec. And I know his experience and perspective will add tremendous value, as we complete the acquisition of Celesio over the coming year. Turning now to our results for the quarter. Today, we reported strong second quarter results with total company revenues of $33 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.27. Based on our performance for the first half of the fiscal year and our improved outlook for the year, we are raising our full year guidance and now expect to achieve adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $8.40 to $8.70. Now I will turn our -- turn to our operations and provide some brief highlights from both segments of our business. Distribution Solutions revenue grew 11% for the quarter, and adjusted operating profit grew 18%. Within our Distribution Solutions segment, our U.S. pharmaceutical business had another quarter of outstanding results. Direct distribution and services revenues increased 13% for the quarter, consistent with our expectations for strong growth for the year. The quarter benefited from growth across our portfolio of generic pharmaceuticals, where we are extremely well positioned with our customer-focused proprietary programs and the value we provide across our extensive generic offering. We continue to benefit from more of our customers choosing to buy more of their generics from McKesson, strong compliance to our generic programs and services, and strong growth in our OneStop Generics program. In the second quarter, we continue to experience favorable pricing on certain products in our generics portfolio, principally driven by a few products where there has been supply disruption. While we are confident in the continued strong performance of our total portfolio of generic pharmaceutical products and programs and the value we provide to our customers, it is difficult to predict larger environmental factors such as supply disruptions and manufacture behavior. That being said, in the updated guidance we provided to you today, we have assumed generic performance continues ahead of our original expectations for the second half of our fiscal year but at a moderated pace compared to the first half of the fiscal year. In summary, I'm proud of the performance of our U.S. pharmaceutical business, which continues to benefit from the excellence of our global sourcing capabilities and our relentless focus on operational excellence. Our specialty business had solid results in the second quarter, and we continue to strengthen our position with our customers and our physician partners. We also saw strong growth in our Canadian business where revenues grew 14% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued growth in our core business and growth from new customers. Our team in Canada has done a tremendous job of growing the business and expanding the value we provide to our customers. We have grown steadily and profitably in Canada over many years, even though the nature of the market and the role of government in healthcare are different from what we experienced here in the United States. In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of the Canadian business in the first half of the fiscal year. Turning to our Medical-Surgical business. We continue to make good progress with the acquisition of PSS, and I'm pleased with the solid results in the first half of our fiscal year. I recently joined the Medical-Surgical team at the Health Industry Distributors Association Annual Meeting. At the meeting, I had a chance to speak with some of our suppliers and hear directly about the expanded opportunities and efficiencies they experienced working with the combined Med-Surg and PSS teams. We remain on track to deliver the value we had envisioned in the business case, and I'm very pleased with our team in the way they have executed against this plan, always remaining focused on taking care of our customers as the top priority. In summary, we've had strong results in Distribution Solutions in the first half of the year. We are excited about the opportunities in front of us and confident in our outlook for the rest of the year. Turning now to our Technology Solutions segment. We had solid results in the second quarter with revenues up 8% and adjusted operating profit up 23% over the prior year. Our adjusted operating margin improved 214 basis points to 16.82%. We continue to benefit from a number of actions we took in the Technology Solutions segment and across the entire enterprise to better position the company for fiscal 2014. Second quarter results in Technology Solutions also benefit from a number of acquisitions we completed in fiscal 2013. The acquisitions we completed last year, along with some of the internal changes to our organization, were all designed to better focus our efforts on our customers' most important priorities: empowering strategic and point of care decisions through business intelligence solutions; preparing for new risk-based payment models, better known as population health; providing tools and services to support value-based reimbursement; and enabling connectivity across the care continuum through interoperability. We continue to make good progress on all of these investments and initiatives, and I'm pleased with the results of our Technology Solutions business in the first half of the fiscal year. Our core businesses are performing well against our plan for the fiscal year, and we continue to invest in the solutions our customers will need to thrive going forward. In summary, it's an exciting time to be at McKesson. Our businesses are performing very well. And today's announcement of our agreement to acquire Celesio makes us very well positioned to continue our leadership in healthcare, in the supply chain and in increasing global markets in which we serve. With that, I'll turn the call over to James and will return to address your questions when he finishes. James?
James Beer: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As John mentioned, McKesson's second quarter results represent another strong quarter of operating performance across the business. Based on this performance and our outlook for the rest of fiscal 2014, we have updated our full year guidance for adjusted earnings from continuing operations from our previous range of $8.05 to $8.35 to a new range of $8.40 to $8.70 per diluted share. The Celesio acquisition represents an exciting step for McKesson, and we are confident this acquisition will only further compliment the value we bring to our customers, manufacturing partners and shareholders. Today, I will walk you through our second quarter consolidated financial results and provide an update on our fiscal 2014 outlook. And at the end of my remarks, I will review the key financial aspects of the transaction we announced today with Celesio. My remarks will focus on our second quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $2.27, which excludes 4 items: the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, certain litigation reserve adjustments, and LIFO-related adjustments. Before I begin, let me provide a brief update on our divestiture activity. As previously announced on our May 7 earnings call, we discussed our intention to exit our International Technology business, our Hospital Automation business and our minority interest in Nadro. This quarter, we completed the transaction to sell our minority interest in Nadro, and subsequent to the close of the quarter, we executed a definitive agreement to sell our Hospital Automation business. We continue to make good progress on the sale of our International Technology business and expect to provide an update later in the fiscal year. Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedule 2A. Consolidated revenues increased 11% for the quarter to $33 billion. On this 11% revenue growth, adjusted gross profit for the quarter increased 22% to $2.1 billion. Solid operating performance in the current year and results from acquisitions closed in fiscal 2013 contributed to both segments achieving healthy adjusted gross profit margins. Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.2 billion were up 23% for the quarter, driven primarily by the impact of acquisitions closed in fiscal 2013. For the full year, excluding the impact of these acquisitions, we expect total company adjusted operating expenses to increase approximately 4%. Other income was relatively flat for the quarter at $9 million. Interest expense increased 7% versus the prior year to $59 million, driven primarily by $1.8 billion in notes issued in late fiscal 2013 and partially offset by the repayment of $500 million in long-term debt in March 2013. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter of 33% is up from the prior year due to a number of discrete items and a slightly less favorable mix of income. I would remind you that adjusted tax rate may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. While our mix of domestic to foreign income has become less favorable this quarter, we are expecting a number of favorable discrete tax items during the balance of our fiscal year. We continue to expect a full year estimate of 31% for our fiscal 2014 adjusted tax rate. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $529 million, and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $2.27. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 3% year-over-year to 233 million. This year's earnings per share number was also aided by the cumulative impact of our share repurchases. Given the planned acquisition of Celesio, we expect our full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding for fiscal 2014 to be 233 million, as we now expect to not repurchase shares during the second half of our fiscal year. Moving now to our segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3A. Distribution Solutions total revenues increased 11% for the quarter to $32.2 billion. Looking at the components, direct distribution and services revenues were up 13% for the quarter to $23.7 billion. Warehouse revenues decreased 10% for the quarter, primarily driven by a shift to direct store delivery. Canadian revenues on a constant currency basis increased 14% this quarter from the prior year, mainly driven by market growth and recent customer wins. Turning now to our Medical-Surgical business. Revenues were up 68% for the quarter to $1.5 billion, driven by the PSS acquisition and market growth. As John mentioned earlier, the combined business continues to perform very well. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit increased 24% for the quarter on 11% revenue growth, resulting in a 56-basis-point improvement in our adjusted gross profit margin. In addition to the PSS acquisition, our second quarter gross profit in Distribution Solutions benefited from favorable performance in our generics pharmaceutical portfolio. Adjusted operating expense for the segment increased 31% for the quarter, primarily driven by the acquisitions we made in fiscal 2013. Adjusted operating margin rates for the quarter were 257 basis points, an improvement of 15 basis points versus the prior year. Given the quarterly variability in the segment, we always focus on full year margins. In this context, based on the first half performance and our updated outlook for the full year, we expect the adjusted operating margin for Distribution Solutions to be above the midpoint of our long-term adjusted operating margin goal of 200 to 250 basis points. Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were up 8% for the quarter to $785 million. Adjusted operating expenses in the segment increased 7% for the quarter, mainly due to the impact of the acquisitions we made in the prior year. Technology Solutions gross R&D spending for the quarter was $110 million, up 3% versus the prior year. Of this amount, we capitalized 6% versus 9% a year ago. Second quarter adjusted operating profit was up 23% to $132 million, and the second quarter adjusted operating margin was 16.82%, an increase of 214 basis points versus the prior year, driven by the contribution from acquisitions completed during fiscal 2013 and favorable performance across the segment. For the year, we continue to expect to be within the high end of our mid-teens long-term adjusted operating margin goal. Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. As you've heard us discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be impacted by timing, including the timing of payments or what day of the week marks the close of any given quarter. At the end of the second quarter, our days sales outstanding was 24 days versus 26 days a year ago. Our days sales in inventories of 31 days is down from 32 days a year ago, and our days sales in payables decreased by 2 days to 48 days. We generated cash flow from operations of $813 million. Overall, for the full year, we continue to expect the cash flow from operations will be approximately $2 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3 billion with $1.6 billion held offshore. Internal capital spending was $197 million for the first half of fiscal 2014, and we continue to expect full year internal capital spending between $400 million and $450 million. Now let's turn to our outlook. As I mentioned earlier, we are raising our fiscal 2014 guidance from our prior range of $8.05 to $8.35 to a new range of $8.40 to $8.70 per diluted share from continuing operations. In addition, based on acquisitions closed to date, we expect to exclude from GAAP earnings $0.76 in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and $0.23 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. We also expect to exclude $0.18 for litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments of $0.37 to $0.43. Now let me take a few moments to talk about the acquisition of Celesio. As John mentioned in his remarks, the process to complete the acquisition is different from acquisitions McKesson has done in the past. There are a few key steps in the process that are important to understand. McKesson has entered into a stock purchase agreement with the Haniel Group, the majority shareholder in Celesio. McKesson has agreed to acquire the Haniel Group's stake in Celesio, currently representing 50.01% of the total outstanding shares of the company. McKesson has also entered into a business combination agreement with Celesio. Pursuant to these agreements, McKesson will launch parallel public tender offers for the remaining publicly traded shares of Celesio for EUR 23 per share and for Celesio's outstanding convertible bonds due in 2014 and 2018 at the price corresponding to the value of the underlying shares implied by a EUR 23 per share offer price. The offer price per bonds due in 2014 equates to EUR 53,117.78 per bond on a maturity value of EUR 50,000. The offer price per bonds due in 2018 equates to EUR 120,798.32 per bond on a maturity value of EUR 100,000. We expect these tender offers to commence during our fiscal third quarter and conclude during our fiscal fourth quarter ending March 31, 2014. Both the stock purchase from the Haniel Group and the tender offers are subject to certain closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the acquisition by McKesson of a minimum of $0.75 of outstanding shares of Celesio on a fully diluted basis. Upon the successful conclusion of the tender offers, we will consolidate the financial results of Celesio, and our earnings will reflect our proportionate share of Celesio's earnings. We estimate this transaction to be $1 to $1.20 accretive in the first 12 months following the successful completion of the tender offers. This estimated range of accretion assumes we achieve 100% ownership of the shares of Celesio at the conclusion of the tender offers. Of course, the final range of accretion will depend on the actual results of the tender offers, the permanent financing structure selected and the estimated operating results of Celesio. Also, to be clear, we have not included any earnings from Celesio in our updated fiscal 2014 outlook. As I said before, we will begin to consolidate the results of Celesio in proportion to the actual shares tendered when the tender offer process concludes. Subsequent to the conclusion of the tender process, there are a number of required steps we are obligated to follow to obtain operating control of Celesio. We expect to complete these steps during fiscal 2015. Synergies will be achieved over time. By the fourth year following completion of the required steps to obtain operating control, we expect to realize annual synergies between $275 million and $325 million. Now let's discuss the transaction's financing. We expect to use our existing offshore cash to fund a portion of the transaction. We also expect to use a bridge facility to fund the balance of the tendered securities. The permanent financing structure will be determined by the timing and the number of Celesio shares and convertible bonds tendered. Additionally, McKesson is committed to maintaining its status as an investment-grade-rated company in considering the permanent financing structure. At this time, we intend to enter into financial instruments to partially hedge the foreign currency risk associated with Celesio's enterprise value. In the transaction announcement you have seen today, we have assumed a euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate of $1.35. To give you a simple way to think about this, every 1% change in the U.S. dollar euro exchange rate represents approximately $80 million in Celesio's total enterprise value. We consider many financial metrics when evaluating acquisition opportunities. And we believe this acquisition will provide a strong return on capital for McKesson's shareholders. In summary, this is a very exciting time to be at McKesson. The core businesses are performing exceptionally well as demonstrated by our results in the first half and our confidence in the improved outlook for the full year. In addition, we expect the acquisition of Celesio to drive value for our customers, our manufacturing partners and of course, our shareholders. Thank you, and with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions]
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: James, welcome. Nice way to start off your tenure. John, understanding that there's lot of changes in the global healthcare distribution landscape right now, I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit or share with us your thoughts around the timing and why this transaction was right for McKesson to pursue right now.
John H. Hammergren: Well, thank you for the question, Robert. Clearly, these things have to be somewhat opportunistic, and when the opportunities arise, you have to be prepared to feel confident in your ability to execute. And so we have been traveling to Europe for my -- almost my entire tenure, and we've built our global sourcing businesses around the globe. And we've known the people who have been competing in Europe for quite some time. I think our success, both here in the United States as well as in Canada, relative to building relationships with our manufacturing partners, helping to deliver better supply chain efficiency and better sourcing power with relative to McKesson, has given us confidence that we can continue to take these skills and assist Celesio's tremendous management team and focus in the countries with a global platform. So as you mentioned in the beginning of your question, the world is more rapidly globalizing and consolidating, and clearly, McKesson needs to continue to have a leadership role around the world.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Great. I guess, just my follow-up would be around the synergies. I'm sure there's a lot of work that went into assessing the potential synergy opportunities of these 2 combined companies. And specifically as it relates to generic procurement, I was hoping you'd give us a little bit of detail around the process you undertook in assessing the potential generic purchasing synergies. And then, I guess, just on the back of that more immediately, just so we understand, will McKesson and Celesio be purchasing generics as a single entity right away?
John H. Hammergren: Well, clearly, as James highlighted in his discussions, that we have to get to operational control of the company before we can begin to combine our operations on a global basis. That doesn't mean that we can't begin to lay the groundwork today to be prepared for what we believe will be a successful transaction as we move forward. We have, I think, demonstrated not only this quarter but also in previous quarters and years our continued growing ability to manage the supply chain in a way that's effective for the partners that we've worked with over decades to grow the value we deliver to them in return. And I think that the sourcing capability that we have, both in generics as well as our relationships with the branded manufacturers and clearly, our strength with Northstar, are all proven capabilities. And we've, over the years, been able to transition that capability beyond the U.S. into our Canadian business to where, frankly, the markets are probably more European in their style and in their makeup than they are even here in the U.S. And we are able to take that supply chain expertise into a market that has a different regulatory and reimbursement regimen. So as we evaluated the opportunity in Celesio, clearly, we needed to look at individual markets. It's not a company that is operating the same way in each market, and we looked at the tremendous tenure and the track record of a company. It's nearly 180 years old. We met with the country managers and talked about how they're executing in their markets and got very confident -- comfortable and confident that this is not necessarily an operational turnaround that's going to require us to go in and fix the current business day to day in these markets. The Lloyds brand continues to grow in presence. They've had a European pharmacy network strategy that's building out nicely, and clearly, they've had an operational excellence program that is working well. It's not to say that we can't provide some things that will help. But I want to be clear on the fact that we have tremendous confidence in the Celesio management team's ability to continue to manage in the business. So what we're primarily we're focused on, as you point out, is the global supply chain synergies that we've outlined in this announcement, and we believe that based on our previous experience doing this and where we see the markets evolving and what others are doing in the marketplace, we're very comfortable and confident that we can reach these numbers.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Tom Gallucci with FBR.
Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: I guess, just sort of piggybacking on that last synergy question, are all the synergies anticipated or primarily anticipated to be coming from purchasing? Or are there any other buckets that we should be thinking about as well as what is the synergy target that you sort of got implied in that initial $1 to $1.20 of accretion in the first 12 months?
John H. Hammergren: Well, the principal and primary driver of our synergies is going to be the supply chain and sourcing activity that we outlined. I think it's probably fair to say, James, that the accretion number comes faster than the synergy numbers. So James, maybe you can talk about that.
James Beer: Yes, that's right. So the accretion range that I spoke about, the $1 to $1.20, that begins upon the completion of the successful tender. And we're looking for that to occur in Q4 of fiscal '14. Now based upon the process that we abide by under German law, it will be several months or so before we would actually be able to take operation control. So we'd be of the order of halfway through fiscal '15 before we were to able to exercise that operating control and have any access to synergies. And then I think it would be a case of synergies building gradually over that 4-year period that I spoke about such that in year 4, we'd be up of that $275 million to $325 million annual range, so quite a gradual ramp, a modest impact on fiscal '15.
Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: And then on the follow-up, John, I think during your prepared remarks, you mentioned that some customers were buying more generics through you. Can you expand on that comment and what you're seeing out there today? Do you anticipate there's the potential that some of the very big customers may be doing more and more through you or that there's even the opportunity to do something sort of like Walgreens and with ABC and take over the distribution entirely for some of the big customers, sort of the way this landscape is evolving?
John H. Hammergren: Well, you're clearly -- it's difficult to project what customers are going to do and what behavior they might have and what might be attractive to them. I would say that there's tremendous evidence in our track record that we've been able to move upstream with our customers, and ever larger customers are beginning to count on McKesson from a logistics perspective and a sourcing perspective. I'm carefully selecting my words here that logistics is certainly a part of the value that we can deliver to a customer. So even the very largest customers would probably benefit from our logistics expertise, and we can provide efficiency through that capability. The sourcing activity is actually the power we bring to a discussion with a customer relative to our scale and size and our ability to attract great manufacturing partners and help them gain market acceptance through their partnership with McKesson. That's a little bit different activity than truly the logistics. The key in our strategy is to marry the 2 together and bring that combined value to our customers. And having said all of that, clearly, the more scale we have, the larger our presence, the easier we are to do business with from a supply chain perspective and the more efficient we become globally and we can become a sort of a one-stop shop for people to create global partnerships, those partners can grow with us through those relationships, which makes it easier for them. So as we gain scale, I think our value proposition to more sophisticated and larger customers continues to improve, and we remain optimistic that we will continue to grow our generics franchise in this way.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: John, should we assume further international deals now and drug retail and distribution are now part of the equation? And then just the other question, would be just -- with $8 billion going out the door, you cite some synergies, but how do you protect that investment from some of the macro pressures that made some of these international distribution models distasteful to you in the past?
John H. Hammergren: That's a good question. Now clearly, I think one of the things that also gave us confidence in our ability to deploy capital in this fashion was our track record of doing so in an intelligent and responsible way. And we have a very disciplined process in making acquisitions, and the financial parameters that James discussed in his remarks are the first hurdle we have to go through. It's not just accretion. In fact, accretion is the last thing we look at. We look at our discounted cash flow analysis, our ability to get a return and our ability to maintain our return on invested capital over time, albeit sometimes it takes a bit of a depression as we bring a big acquisition like this on. So those parameters are very important to us. We do think there's an opportunity for us to continue to deploy capital in Europe and in Latin America as an example. We think the expertise of Celesio brings in these markets will be extremely helpful to us as we deploy that capital. I mentioned their European pharmacy network activity, clearly, which is a source of opportunity for us as we build out Lloyds and continue to take that banner into a franchise kind of a model in other markets. So that is all an opportunity. But in the early phases of this, our objective will be to delever the company. We're going take on some significant debt here as we go forward, and I think it's important for us to, first, make sure that our financial condition and our balance sheet is in shape before we begin thinking about at least significant capital deployment in any additional markets.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Well, how do you feel comfortable, John, with the government's kind of dictating reimbursement in some of the markets now that you're going into? I mean, how do you protect yourself from cuts, either on dispensing fees or generic reimbursement?
John H. Hammergren: Well, that was the second part of your question. I think you said the European wholesalers have had some challenges. If you actually look at Celesio's history, many of its challenges were self inflicted related to deployment of capital. They have now sold DocMorris, which was a channel conflict for them. They made some other acquisitions that, frankly, that I think in retrospect probably didn't work as they had been -- they had anticipated. So I think we -- the first decision is to make share you don't make mistakes in those markets from a capital deployment perspective and you don't compete with your customers. And I'd say the second thing is we go into this with our eyes wide open. We only have the ability to help customers and supply chain when the supply chain is an opportunity for us to affect. And in some markets, as you pointed out, the choice of product may be made by governments or other health plans or payers that really takes that decision out of our control. And our synergies, as we've outlined them here, reflect the fact that some of these markets will not be available opportunities for us, at least in the early phases. So we don't think we're going to change healthcare financing in these markets. And we've been dealing with a market like Canada, which is very European-esque in its approach to drug reimbursement and the way prices are determined. And we've been able to grow nicely in a market like that because we come with a full and complete solution. And frankly, some of these payers, I think, will be encouraged by our approach to pharmaceutical use and how, in fact, it actually, if it's properly done, can reduce the cost of healthcare in those markets as opposed to being a target for continued, as you refer to it, cuts and slashes in reimbursement. But we're not going into this with a myopic view that somehow we're going to change the way the pharmaceuticals are purchased by governments around the globe.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: John, just thinking about co-op purchasing and thinking about generics, is this something like you'll set up now with your Celesio partner something similar to what we see with AB and Walgreens and then allow some of your larger retailers to buy generics on that way? Not so much disturbing them but actually a purchasing cooperative, is that something that you're thinking about as you move forward with this?
John H. Hammergren: Well, clearly, we are always open to creative ways to bring value to our partners and our customers. And I think that what's nice about this transaction with Celesio is we get global scale immediately without having to deal with some of the challenges associated with the venture structure and some of the management issues that may come along with it. However, we do think that there are ways for us to take that scale and strategy and bring it to our customers in a way that will benefit them. I don't know that it necessarily has to take on a venture format, but clearly, we can find ways to make sure that our customers benefit along with us, both the supply customers, as well -- the manufacturing customers as well as the retail customers and hospital customers.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, great. And then think my follow-up question, I mean, clearly, great results again this quarter. On the core distribution side, can you talk about where you're taking market share to see the direct business up, growing 13% well above the market? Can just give us an idea of, again, where you're taking market share from today and how you see that going forward?
John H. Hammergren: Well, we've been heavily focused on working with our existing customers to get an ever-increasing share of their business. So a portion of that direct distribution business growth is actually coming out of our existing warehousing line or out of our customer base where they've been sourcing a portion of their product in a direct basis and are now increasingly using McKesson to assist them in their transactions in generics and in brand for that matter. So I think that our objective is to continue to grow with our customers. We are focused on expanding our margins through the services and the value add that we deliver, and that's been our priority.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And where would you say we are, though, in that process? You've been talking about this for a while. Are we still in the fairly early innings of that? Or do you think that we're in the latter part of pulling that incremental business into McKesson?
John H. Hammergren: Well, I think it's an ongoing process. I think you won't find a year -- I don't -- I shouldn't give you a forecast, but I think this has been an unusual year. As you know, there have been fewer generic launches, so that helps our revenues grow in a marketplace where the generics aren't taking the price of the brand down so much. And I also would say that we had some significant transitions with customers this year where we had a favorable move in mix with those customers, from warehousing to direct purchases. And that probably -- that delta probably don't won't continue like it has this year. And of course, we had PSS in our business, which is also an increment in both revenue and in margin expansion as well as the overall year-on-year comparison.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Maybe just stepping over to the IT business for a second here, the revenue, a little bit light versus what we had expected but the margins, obviously, looking much better. But as you expand internationally and you have a lot of growth opportunities there, can you talk about the strategic value of holding on to this IT business? I mean, its contribution to total revenue and operating profit is slowly shrinking here. Maybe you can give us your thoughts around that, John.
John H. Hammergren: Well, clearly, we're very happy with the performance of our Technology Solutions business this year. It really marks the turnaround, I think, both strategically and financially for that business. We've done a great job, I believe, of organizing it in a way that will be effective going forward, and I think our customers have benefited from what we've been doing. Our responsibility as an executive team is to always review the portfolio of businesses that we manage, and as you have noted, this year, we have made a decision to exit some of the businesses that we believe didn't stand up to either the strategic value or the business performance value that we expect from these assets. So I wouldn't say that we're married to any strategy relative to what assets we have other than success. I think that our recent results in technology have been successful. So there are no plans for us to change the mix. However, our responsibility is to constantly come back and revisit that decision.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And just sort of follow-up, James, I think if I heard you right, you're saying that you expect for the -- for fiscal '14 to be above your target 200 to 250 basis points for operating margin. Is that -- should we think about that as a sustainable level? And does that mean our long-term target changes? Or how should we think about that beyond fiscal '14?
James Beer: Well, for the Distribution Solutions segment, we're expecting the full year fiscal '14 operating margin to be above the midpoint of that 200- to 250-basis-point range. So I think that's important to clarify. And we'll update that as we go along in the coming years.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Glen Santangelo with Crédit Suisse.
Glen J. Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: John, just a couple of quick questions. I'm kind of curious to get your perspective on some of the differences between the European wholesale model and what you have domestically. And with that, I'm kind of curious, could you comment a little bit more on traditional generic versus brand economics given the regulated pricing environment? Is it structured similarly? Or how do -- can you give us some more color?
John H. Hammergren: Well, Glen, I think that the wholesale model in terms of the logistics operations are similar to ours. However, the delivery model in some of the markets is different. The frequency with which they deliver the stores, the frequency of the order pattern of the customers are slightly different. But essentially, wholesaling in Europe is wholesaling in our North American operations. We buy from the same manufacturers, both generic and brand. We have similar kinds of relationships, and there's a process by which we can improve the efficiency with our retail customers through the systems we deploy and the information we provide and the way we help those either owned or banner stores be more productive and more involved in the clinical care process. And I think, increasingly, what we're finding in the global markets, including the U.S., frankly, is that pharmacy is becoming more and more of a care provider beyond just the dispensing of medication. It is a lower-cost alternative than going to the emergency rooms or going to someplace else. You've seen the emergence of things like MinuteClinic, with CVS, et cetera, that have been quite successful. And I think types of models are also permeating the European landscape. Now clearly, the buying process of generics in the U.S. is fragmented. Some of it's wholesaling -- wholesalers that are purchasing the generics, and sometimes it's the large retailers that are purchasing the generics. And if you move into Europe, you probably have a similar model there. And in terms of the reimbursement in some of the markets, the wholesaler and the retailers are making the decision on the selection of the generic. And in other markets, other payers or governments are making the decision on selecting the generics. So I think there are nuancial [ph] changes or differences in the way that the markets work that have an implication on how you prepare yourself in the marketplace. But if you actually look under the covers of the various countries in which Celesio competes, the operating margin structure and the way they approach the market is very similar to what we do in our Canadian or our U.S. operations. So there's not a lot of dissimilarities. And when I talked about the synergies earlier from a supply chain perspective, those synergies are really crafted around models where McKesson has more of an influence over the relationship between, particularly the generic, a manufacture choice and the customer's ability to sell it through.
Glen J. Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: John, maybe if I can just follow up on that, I mean, you commented on some of the regulatory issues that impact that European wholesaling business. But if you look at the recent brand-to-generic conversion, it kind of looks like those companies haven't gotten the same lift that sort of domestic players have had. And then if you read some of the regulatory filings from Celesio, they talk about incremental competition in discounting, and while you reap the benefits of an oligopoly here in the United States, it feels like there was more incremental pricing pressure over there. So could you comment on the competitive environment and how you think about the profit outlook for those businesses?
John H. Hammergren: Well, there are 2 different streams of thought there. Clearly, the penetration of generics in Europe is below that, that we experienced in the U.S. And therefore, there's a significant opportunity for us to expand the utilization of generics and therefore, improve the profitability of the operations as generics are more widely consumed. So we see that, clearly, as an opportunity. Once again, that's not really built into our synergy assumptions. The view we have relative to our ability to manage the generics selection process, et cetera, is really country by country. And we -- I think each one operates in a different way, and I think our analysis has been pretty thorough in terms of where we think the countries are going to manage generics in a way that works for the model that we've deployed. And on the competition front, if you actually look inside, I think what Celesio has said publicly, the competitive dynamic has been most difficult for them in Germany. I think the rest of the markets appear to be relatively stable, and the companies that are competing in those markets seem to be doing so in a rational basis. And clearly, we have our eyes wide open on the results that have been achieved over there as well. I think our going in position is that we have to manage this business carefully, that the Celesio management team has a good grip on what they're doing, and the country presidents have tremendous experience in their markets and understand those markets and are doing what they need to do to manage effectively.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So just if you can help us provide some context along the supply chain synergies targets for the next 4 years, can you give us some sense as to what is the combined generic sourcing power for the 2 companies?
John H. Hammergren: Well, I think that it's fair to say that we have been able to look carefully at the generic purchasing patterns and as I said earlier, look at it on a country-by-country basis. And we've compared what's going on with Celesio to what we've got with United States and Canada, and we believe there's a significant opportunity. The quantification of generics is one that is difficult to make on a comparative basis because everybody looks at it in a different way, what goes through distribution, what's controlled spend, what goes through retail, et cetera. So I think it's probably fair to say that those comparisons are not as relevant as really getting inside the business model, and that's really the magic on how we've been able to continue to grow our program, as evidenced in the results this quarter.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then in the prepared remark, you mentioned the convergence between the segments and the globalization. So is Celesio's retail business core to your strategy?
John H. Hammergren: Well, clearly, retail is core to our strategy, and retail for Celesio in the markets in which they own the stores has been a very successful strategy, and the Lloyds brand has performed quite well for them. In the markets where Celesio owns retail, other wholesalers own retail as well, and that dynamic has been in place for a long, long time. We do not plan to enter the retail space in the U.S. or Canada on a direct basis, and in the markets in Europe, most of them are regulated from a retail perspective where independence have a great deal of power in those markets and deliver most of the medications from a retail perspective. And Celesio has done a terrific job in those countries in building relationships with these independent pharmacies to allow them to continue to be very successful on both the financial and clinical dimensions in which they're working. And those partnerships and relationships with independent pharmacies remain critical to McKesson and Celesio going forward globally. And part of the value that we bring is the continued scale and influence that we have, as well as our operating expertise that is enhanced, I think, by the Lloyds experience that when independent retailers are looking for a partner, that Lloyds experience helps us help them manage their stores in a more complete way.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Steven Valiquette with UBS.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So congratulations on this deal. Boy, certainly nobody saw this coming. I mentioned that as kind of jokingly here. So I think you've done some detailed work on the generic synergies, and I guess, preliminarily, just trying to think about some of the flow here, do you see more of the potential McKesson U.S. generic procurement and that supply flowing to Europe? Or would more flow from the Celesio European generic procurement into the U.S? So which side right now may have the larger synergy potential? And also, do you actually even think about it that way?
John H. Hammergren: Well, I think we probably don't think about it that way necessarily. As you think about the people we partner with in generics, they're global companies, and we source on a global basis. I think that the synergy number we provided you is a McKesson-Celesio combined synergy number. And I think that we haven't thought about necessarily giving you any data on a discrete market-by-market basis relative to where those generics would go. But we have -- we clearly believe that it's a global business, and our global relationships will benefit both our supply chain partners as well as our customers.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Eric Coldwell with Robert Baird.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I -- most of mine have been covered at this point, and I think you -- John, you've loosely referred to my next question a few times, but I'll ask it more succinctly. I know you mentioned it was an opportunistic deal here, and maybe there weren't other options available to you. But something you could give more specific color on your thought process with an outright buy versus other options that have been rumored in the press, such as perhaps only buying the distribution piece or partnering with a large U.S. pharmacy on the deal either jointly or splitting it up. Was outright buy really the only thing you were looking to do? Or were there perhaps other options that you would have considered?
John H. Hammergren: Clearly, this transaction was speculated upon, has been for a long time. And you could even go back 10 years ago, the speculation existed. At some point, McKesson and perhaps others would take a more global perspective on distribution. I think our perspective is that the entire transaction made the most sense for us. The combined retail and wholesale operation that's principally operated in the U.K. for Celesio has worked extremely well, and we saw no reason to separating those 2 operations just because of a change in ownership. And I would say that we believe that the ability for McKesson to execute against the synergies is enhanced through a complete ownership model as opposed to some type of a venture or the additional complexity of trying to buy an asset with multiple companies involved and then changing the strategies of those companies after we acquire them to change the course that they were currently on. This is not an operational turnaround execution issue for Celesio and McKesson to deal with. If you actually think about the challenges that Celesio has had, it's principally a challenge with pricing in existing market and the acquisition and capital deployment strategies that they've been about fixing over the last 12 to 18 months. So I think adding additional operating complexity by trying to do it differently just didn't make any sense, and we're focused on executing going forward, and we think we can do so on a combined basis very well. I would end with saying that I do believe there are additional opportunities for us to work with others that will provide value, and we're certainly open to various models as we complete this transaction that will afford our customers and our supply chain partners with additional value. I certainly want to thank the operator today, and I want to thank all of you on the call for your time. I'm certainly pleased with our strong second quarter performance, and I'm very excited about the future of the business and our acquisition of Celesio. I look forward to welcoming the management team and employees of Celesio and, together, creating a global platform to grow and support the success of our customers. I'll now hand the call off to Erin for her review of upcoming events and for the financial community. Erin?
Erin Lampert: Thank you, John. I have a preview of an upcoming event for the financial community. On November 12, we will present at the Crédit Suisse Health Care Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona. We will release third quarter earnings late in January. Thank you, and goodbye.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2014 Q1  (2013-07-25 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Erin Lampert John H. Hammergren - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President
Analysts: Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Glen J. Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division Robert M.

Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.
Erin Lampert: Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and welcome to McKesson's Fiscal 2014 First Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO. John will first provide a business update, and I will return to provide a review of the financial results for the quarter. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after 1 hour at 6 p.m. Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results acquisition expenses and related adjustments, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and certain litigation reserve adjustments. Consistent with the guidance we provided on May 7, we have updated our definition of adjusted earnings to exclude LIFO-related adjustments. We will discuss this update to the presentation of our adjusted earnings in more detail later in the call. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for investors. Please refer to our press release announcing first quarter fiscal 2014 results available on our website for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thanks, and here's John Hammergren.
John H. Hammergren: Thanks, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Today, we reported an excellent start to fiscal 2014, with total company revenues of $32.2 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.07. Based on the strong results in the first quarter, we are raising our full year guidance and now expect to achieve adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $8.05 to $8.35. Before I begin my comments on our business performance for the quarter, I want to provide a brief update on 2 items in the presentation of our financial statements. First in the March quarter, we talked about a number of actions to better position the company going forward, including our intention to exit our minority investment in Nadro and our intention to sell our International Technology and Hospital Automation businesses. I'm pleased to report that we are making good progress on the planned divestitures, and you will now see these results reported in discontinued operations. And second, as Erin mentioned, we have updated our definition of adjusted earnings to exclude LIFO-related adjustments. We believe this update to our definition of adjusted earnings will better represent the core operating performance of our business. Erin will provide additional background and context for our view of LIFO-related adjustments in her remarks. Moving on to our business results for the quarter. Distribution Solutions had a great start to the year with revenue growth of 5% and adjusted operating profit growth of 27%. Our U.S. Pharmaceutical business once again led the way with outstanding results for the quarter. Direct distribution and services revenues increased 8% for the quarter, in line with our expectations for strong growth for the year. We also experienced strong growth across our portfolio of generic pharmaceuticals, driven in part by favorable pricing in the first quarter. As you know, we have a strong and proven track record with our various generics programs. Our management team has done a great job of not only growing our generics footprint but also building our relationships with our manufacturing partners across the globe. McKesson remains well positioned with our customer-focused proprietary programs and the value that we provide across our extensive generic offering. There's no better evidence of the value we provide through our generic programs than the voice of our customer, and our customers continue to purchase more and more of their generics through McKesson. You've heard me mention on a number of occasions how proud I am of the performance of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. Our team consistently finds new ways to improve the service and value we provide to all of our customers. A great example of how we connect with our customers is our annual conference, which brings together thousands of independent pharmacy owners and pharmacists from across the country. The conference provides a forum for our customers to exchange best practices that can help them achieve better overall pharmacy health. This year's event focused on helping our customers connect with their patients and other health care stakeholders in entirely new ways through clinical and medication adherence solutions, mobile technologies and enhanced marketing tools. The conference featured continuing education courses, public policy forums and live demonstrations designed to help independent pharmacy owners achieve better business health, better results for patients and create a better future for the community pharmacy. A significant number of Health Mart pharmacy owners were in attendance and we were excited to debut a number of solutions designed to continue to differentiate and drive value for our members, including a new store design, an enhanced physician outreach program and a variety of medication adherence tools. Health Mart owners were able to view new local marketing solutions and mobile applications, both of which are designed to help attract more consumers into Health Mart pharmacies. With more than 3,100 pharmacies across the country, Health Mart has become the franchise model of choice for independent pharmacy owners looking to augment their local relationships with the backing of a strong national brand. In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business in the first quarter and the great start it had to the fiscal year. Moving now to our Specialty business. We had solid results in the first quarter, and we expect nice revenue and profit growth in this business for the full year. We continue to expand the value we bring to our manufacturing and physician partners through our unique view of the business's specialty providers. At our recent Investor Day, we highlighted the value we bring to our physician and manufacturing partners in an evolving and complex environment. When we help our physician partners, regardless of the setting of care, not only do we have the strongest and most comprehensive offering to community cancer care through our U.S. Oncology Network, but often we continue to manage the outpatient cancer care when physicians affiliate with hospitals. I'm excited about the progress we continue to make in our Specialty business and believe we are well positioned to continue to grow and innovate in this dynamic market. Our Canadian business had a solid start to the year, with results that were in line with our expectations for the first quarter. We continue to expect strong growth in Canada for the full year, driven by new customers signed in the previous fiscal year and a recent customer transition. Turning to our Medical-Surgical business. I am pleased with the results in our first full quarter as a combined organization with PSS. We are making strong progress on all of the objectives in our acquisition case, and perhaps most important, our people are excited and engaged about our opportunities to serve our customers going forward. In fact, I just came back from the National Sales Meeting where I met with the newly combined 1,400-person Medical-Surgical sales force, and I have to say, their enthusiasm and spirit for the value we bring to our customers was truly impressive. This was an acquisition anchored in bringing together the best of 2 great organizations, and I'm delighted with the progress and the early results of the combined business and look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead. Based on the strong performance in Distribution Solutions driven primarily by favorable generic performance in the first quarter, we now expect that adjusted operating margin for Distribution Solutions to approach the midpoint of our long-term adjusted operating margin goal of 200 to 250 basis points. In summary, we're off to a terrific start to the year in Distribution Solutions. We are extremely well positioned across all of our distribution businesses and we are confident in our improved outlook for the rest of the year. Technology Solutions had a strong first quarter result, with revenues up 9% and adjusted operating profit up 33%. Our adjusted operating margin improved 308 basis points to 17.02%. As you may recall, last quarter I talked about a number of actions we took in Technology Solutions and across the entire enterprise, frankly, to better position the company for fiscal 2014. And I'm encouraged by the early positive results we have seen thus far. For the first quarter, we continued to make steady progress across all of our businesses within Technology Solutions. Our first quarter results benefited from the steady growth profile of our RelayHealth, McKesson Health Solutions and Enterprise and Medical Imaging businesses. Our first quarter results also benefited from achieving some important GA milestones in our Paragon solution. We remain pleased with the progress we continue to make in helping our Horizon customers transition to Paragon. Paragon continues to enjoy high ratings in terms of customer satisfaction and performance across a broad range of customers from the local community hospital setting to large hospital systems. And finally, in our Physician Services and Software businesses, we turned in solid results for the first quarter, aided by our recent acquisition of Med3000. As a result of this solid performance and the removal of the operating results of our International Technology business and Hospital Automation businesses, which we are now reporting as part of discontinued operations, we now expect the adjusting -- adjusted operating margin for the Technology Solutions segment to be at the high end of our long-term adjusted operating margin goal of mid-teens for the full year. I want to make a few comments about how we are working hard to innovate for our Technology Solutions customers. When I speak to our technology customers, the level of change and complexity they face driven by evolving regulatory and economic realities is simply astonishing. They seek partners like McKesson who can offer a broad view of the changing environment and understand the convergence of the perspectives from hospitals and health systems, payers, providers, pharmacies and, of course, the patient, and they are eager for industry leaders to increasingly deliver solutions that will make the promise of a more connected health care system a reality. We live in exciting times within the health care services and technology industry, and McKesson is well positioned to help our customers succeed. We are proud to be a leader in our industry through our innovative partnerships, particularly the CommonWell Health Alliance. Just to remind everyone, CommonWell Health Alliance is a significant initiative with other leaders in the health care IT industry, who have a common vision and mission to allow patients and their caregivers access to information in a secure and private way anywhere care is offered. The initial goal of the alliance is to develop solutions for patient identity, consent and access management and a common approach to record storage and retrieval, regardless of the core system where the data resides. As you may have seen in a press release issued yesterday, additional leaders in our industry have joined CommonWell Alliance, including Computer Programs and Systems or CPSI and Sunquest Information Systems. They join the founding members of Allscripts, athenahealth, Cerner, Greenway Medical Technologies and McKesson and service provider RelayHealth in the Alliance's work. We're off to a solid start to the year in Technology Solutions, and I'm pleased to see the progress we are making in our core businesses and the investments we are making for the future. In summary, I'm pleased with our performance in the first quarter and our improved outlook for the year. In addition to the strength of our operating performance, we continue to have a strong balance sheet. For the first quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $716 million. And our expectation to deliver cash flow from operations of approximately $2 billion for fiscal 2014 remains unchanged from our original guidance. I'm happy to report that our Board of Directors has authorized a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend, reflecting ongoing confidence in the cash flow strength of our business. And we are extremely well positioned to execute on our portfolio approach to capital deployment, to continue to deliver value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Erin, and I will return to address your questions when she finishes. Erin?
Erin Lampert: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. Today, I will walk you through our first quarter financial results and provide an update on our fiscal 2014 outlook. McKesson reported strong first quarter results and has laid a good foundation for the remainder of fiscal 2014. I will begin with a review of our consolidated results and then provide additional context as I walk through each of the segments in more detail. Let me briefly mention one item that, while it did not impact our adjusted earnings, did impact our GAAP results for the quarter. We continue to work through the remaining AWP cases. As a result of the progress made toward resolving these remaining claims, the litigation reserve has been increased by a pretax charge of $15 million. This charge was recorded in the Distribution Solutions segment and it equates to $0.04 per diluted share. Before I move on, let me also remind you about one other item that impacts the presentation of our financial statements. As previously announced on our May 7 earnings call, we took a number of strategic business realignment actions in our fiscal 2013 fourth quarter. As part of these actions, we are exiting our International Technology and Hospital Automation businesses and the results of these businesses are now reported as discontinued operations. My remarks today will focus on our first quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $2.07, which excludes 4 items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, certain litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments. Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedule 2. Consolidated revenues increased 5% for the quarter to $32.2 billion. I would remind you of our assumptions for the full year, which call for strong revenue growth in both segments. These assumptions still apply. On this 5% revenue growth, adjusted gross profit for the quarter increased 23% to $1.9 billion. Recent acquisitions completed in both segments contributed to this result, with both segments achieving healthy adjusted gross profit margins and expansion. Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.2 billion were up 18% for the quarter, driven by the impact of acquisitions closed in fiscal 2013. For the full year, excluding the impact of recent acquisitions, we continue to expect total company adjusted operating expenses to increase approximately 3% for fiscal 2014. Other income was relatively flat for the quarter at $6 million. Interest expense increased 5% versus the prior year to $59 million, driven primarily by new notes of $1.8 billion issued in late fiscal 2013 and partially offset by the repayment of $500 million in long-term debt in March 2013. For the full year, despite our higher levels of debt, we continue to expect our fiscal 2014 interest expense to be fairly flat versus the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter of 30.6% is in line with our full year estimate of 31% for the adjusted tax rate for fiscal 2014. I would remind you, however, that this adjusted tax rate may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $481 million and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $2.07. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted shares outstanding decreased by 3% year-over-year to 232 million. This year's earnings per share number was aided by the cumulative impact of our share repurchases and our full year assumption of 231 million diluted weighted average shares for fiscal 2014 remains unchanged. Moving now to our segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3. Distribution Solutions' total revenues increased 5% for the quarter to $31.4 billion. Looking at the components, direct distribution and services revenues were up 8% for the quarter to $23 billion, driven by market growth and our mix of business. For the full year fiscal 2014, we continue to anticipate direct revenue growth will rebound strongly from prior year levels, driven by the slowing of brand-to-generic conversions and aided by above-market growth from a handful of our largest customers. Warehouse revenues declined 17% for the quarter, partially driven by a shift to Direct Store Delivery. Canadian revenues on a constant currency basis increased 3% for the quarter. For the full year, we continue to anticipate strong growth in this business as we expect to benefit from recent customer wins and a recent customer transition. Medical-Surgical revenues were up 71% for the quarter to $1.4 billion, driven by the impact of the PSS acquisition. Distribution Solutions' adjusted gross profit increased 25% for the quarter on 5% revenue growth, resulting in a 78-basis-point improvement in our adjusted gross profit margin. In addition to the PSS acquisition, our first quarter gross profit in Distribution Solutions benefited from favorable generic performance. Adjusted operating expense for the segment increased 24% for the quarter, driven by the business acquisitions we made in fiscal 2013. Adjusted operating margin rates for the quarter were 223 basis points, an improvement of 38 basis points versus the prior year. As you've heard us say many times before, given the quarterly variability in this segment, we always focus on full year margins. In this context, based on the first quarter performance and our updated outlook for the full year, we now expect adjusted operating margins for Distribution Solutions to approach the midpoint of our long-term adjusted operating margin goal of 200 to 250 basis points. Turning now to Technology Solutions, revenues were up 9% for the quarter to $805 million. Adjusted operating expenses in the segment increased 9% for the quarter. And here again, you see the impact of the acquisitions we made in the prior year. Technology Solutions' gross R&D spending for the quarter was $113 million, up 10% compared to $103 million in the prior year. Of these amounts, we capitalized 8% versus 7% a year ago. Our first quarter adjusted operating profit was up 33% to $137 million and our first quarter adjusted operating margin rate was 17.02%, an increase of 308 basis points versus the prior year. Before I move on, let me remind you again that the results of our International Technology and Hospital Automation businesses are reported as discontinued operations. And we now expect to be within the high end of our long-term adjusted operating margin goal of mid-teens for fiscal 2014. Said differently, our full year fiscal 2014 outlook for Technology Solutions' operational performance remains unchanged from what we discussed on our May 7 earnings call. Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. As you've heard us discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be impacted by timing, including the timing of payments or what day of the week marks the close of any given quarter. So for receivables, our days sales outstanding remain unchanged at 24 days. Our days sales in inventories of 31 days was flat versus a year ago, and our days sales in payables increased by 3 days to 50 days. These working capital metrics, along with our continued focus on cash generation, resulted in cash flow from operations of $716 million for the quarter. Overall, for the full year, we continue to expect our cash flows from operation will be approximately $2 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.9 billion and we remain confident in our ability to create shareholder value through the continued use of our portfolio approach to capital deployment. In line with our capital deployment philosophy, as you saw in today's press release, our Board of Directors approved a 20% increase to the quarterly dividend. Internal capital spending was $100 million for the quarter, and we continue to expect full year internal capital spending between $400 million and $450 million. Now, I'll turn to our outlook. As John mentioned earlier, we are raising our fiscal 2014 guidance on adjusted earnings from continuing operations from our original range of $7.90 to $8.20, to a new range of $8.05 to $8.35. In addition, we now expect $0.75 amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and $0.22 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. And due to the AWP litigation charge we recorded this quarter, we are now assuming $0.04 for litigation reserve adjustments. Now let me take a few moments to provide context for the LIFO-related adjustments that we expect in fiscal 2014. To give you a bit of history, McKesson elected to use the LIFO method of accounting for a majority of its inventory for accounting purposes more than 30 years ago under a tax conformity rule. While our actual LIFO adjustment is calculated at the end of our fiscal year, for interim reporting purposes, we will allocate that adjustment to the quarters. These quarterly estimates can vary significantly based on net product price trends, including brand-to-generic conversions and inventory levels. A LIFO charge is recognized during inflationary periods when the net effect of price increases on products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines. So what does that mean for fiscal 2014? Taking a step back, if you think about the trends we've experienced over the past several years, for our fiscal years 2005 through 2011 our inventories were in a net price deflation period. This net price deflation was driven primarily by the large number of brand-to-generic conversions that occurred and the overall brand and generic pricing trends. During this time period, we also established a lower of cost or market, or LCM reserve, in order to properly value our inventory on our balance sheet at the lower of cost or market. Then in fiscal 2012, we began to see these trends shift, particularly on brand and generic pricing, and our inventories experienced net price inflation. We continue to expect net inflation in our inventories in fiscal 2014 and are also now at a point where our LCM reserves are anticipated to be depleted in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. As a result, we will begin to record quarterly charges based on our estimate of the LIFO inventory charge for the full year. Sitting here today, we expect to record a total net LIFO-related charge between approximately $0.24 to $0.29 by the end of fiscal 2014. As an aside, for the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we did not record any LIFO-related charges. Consistent with how we discussed LIFO-related charges on our May 7 earnings call, and again at Investor Day in June, our fiscal 2014 guidance excludes the impact of all LIFO-related adjustments. Additionally, we have now updated our definition of non-GAAP measures to exclude LIFO-related adjustments. We believe that excluding LIFO-related adjustments from our definition of adjusted earnings is a better reflection of the company's core operating performance, consistent with how we internally manage the business, and will provide useful information when comparing our past financial performance to our future financial results. We will, of course, continue to provide all of the GAAP information we have historically provided as noted in Schedules 7 through 9. In thinking about our fiscal 2014 guidance and beyond, it is important to note that regardless of what EPS measure is used, our ability to consistently grow our earnings over the long term remains unchanged. Turning back now to the quarter. To summarize, McKesson delivered another outstanding financial performance, and our first quarter results position us well for the remainder of the fiscal year. The strength of our balance sheet and tremendous cash flow provides us with opportunities to deploy capital to advance our long-term strategic objectives and we are optimistic about our fiscal 2014 outlook. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Lisa, I'll turn it back to you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: I guess, first question, just on the margins in the distribution space, clearly you beat the street by a lot. I was curious, how much did you beat your own internal budgets by, for the quarter itself, and what were the key drivers there?
John H. Hammergren: Well, we state our assumptions with you guys every year, annually, about our expectations for the year. And I think that most of the businesses performed in line with where we thought they were going to be. Clearly, U.S. pharma had a very strong quarter and a nice start to the year. And as we both mentioned, I think that performance was primarily driven by the performance of generics. It helped carry us above what we had expected originally and it helped us deliver a nice solid quarter.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: And by that, you're talking about pricing, I guess, John?
John H. Hammergren: Well, it was really across the board. Clearly pricing played a role. But we also, I think, executed some very nice growth on our one-stop generics programs and we had some customers that were buying off of our portfolio in a more aggressive way than even we would've anticipated. So I think all in all, it was the overall generic offering that we have and benefited by some price inflation from our suppliers.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Okay. Can you offer an update on the CFO role?
John H. Hammergren: We're continuing to make good progress on our search for a replacement for our CFO. I have to once again thank Nigel Rees for the great work he's doing as Interim CFO. He's been a long-tenured executive, 12 years with us, and we have just a terrific financial organization. As you noticed, here, we've got Erin really stepping into Jeff's shoes as it relates to this conference call and the preparation for this call. And the depth of the financial organization is really showing as we go through this period of transition. I'm hopeful that we will make quick progress on the selection of a replacement, and we'll be able to move on with the kind of quality which you've expected from us.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I was wondering if maybe you could just talk about, John, in the quarter, or Erin, what -- you talked about it being unusually strong, but how much of this was pull-forward from other quarters versus what we've seen historically? And what is your outlook around drug distribution as we move forward, just given what we've seen in this first quarter?
John H. Hammergren: Well, clearly it was a very strong start to the quarter and -- or for the quarter and the year, and we're really pleased with our results. You can see in that we've taken our guidance up for the year that we do believe that this outperformance in the quarter is not an entire pull-forward of future quarters. Having said all of that, there are 9 months left in this year and we have a significant dependence, as you know, on brand price inflation. And much of that, we anticipate, will come in the latter half of the year. So it's really too early to call success, but I think the ability for us to take the guidance up at least early in the year like we have this quarter is some indication of our view of the strength of the business.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then, John, I guess, my follow-up question would be that in the past, we've talked about international expansion, and clearly, things are going pretty well in Canada, but you've exited Mexico. Can you just give us an updated thought on global purchasing and where McKesson stands on thoughts around getting into other areas of the world from a distribution perspective?
John H. Hammergren: Well, there's really 2 questions there. One is the question of Global Sourcing and our -- the scale and buying power and the ability for the team to execute. I think, once again, the strength of our performance in generics where most of the scale -- or I should say, the scale matters most, is evidenced by the fact that we continue to execute very well there. And it really is a combination of not only important scale but the ability to be adroit in terms of opportunities and take advantage of our relationships and to build value both for our customers and our suppliers. And we've been doing the Global Sourcing thing now for a long time and have built a significant amount of expertise in it. As it relates to distribution in other markets, clearly we have done a nice job in Canada. Our position there has continued to perform well over many years. And we show evidence of our ability to manage beyond the borders of the United States. Having said that, our disciplined approach to capital deployment remains and we've built a strong track record of doing smart things with our shareholders' money. And the first thing is that things have to make financial sense and strategic sense before we move forward and we have to be able to, obviously, feel we can execute against the opportunities that are in front of us. So we think scale is important, but executable scale and a simplicity to the approach, I think, is very important.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: My first question is on the IT side. Obviously, it looks that now with the new geographic concentration the fact that you've exited, discontinued some of the International Technology business is helping to improve the margin. So as we think just longer term, should we think of this as kind of like a new level of profitability for the IT segment?
John H. Hammergren: Erin. maybe you can take that one.
Erin Lampert: Sure. Well, Ricky, as we've tried to highlight on today's call, our operational assumptions for the Technology Solutions segment for the full year really remains unchanged. And what you see in the way that we've guided to our expectation to be at the upper end of our long-term margin range is a reflection of some of that change in mix that you see in the business.
John H. Hammergren: So just to further that, I think the -- clearly, the mix change we've experienced is an important aspect here. The business also performed very well in the first quarter, and we're pleased with the operational condition of the business, albeit it's early in the year. And then lastly, I think Erin provided pretty specific guidance related to -- that the expectation for the year is to be at the high end. So I think that the quarter's result, I wouldn't call it as a baseline, but we're clearly going to be well above where we were in prior years as a result of the transition out of these 2 businesses and the continued strength of the business. So I think we've taken it from low to mid-teens to a new range, and I think you should assume that that's the new baseline.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then just to clarify, the $7.90 to $8.20 guidance, did that include the LIFO charge that you specified?
Erin Lampert: Thanks, Ricky. This is Erin. So, no, when we gave guidance back on May 7, we tried to be very clear and transparent that, that original guidance range did not, in fact, include assumptions related to LIFO. So what you see in terms of the comparison of the original range, and then, of course, our updated range is an apples-to-apples comparison.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with UBS.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I've been dialing back and forth here on a few different calls, but was there any update on the level of accretion that you expect in this fiscal year from the PSSI transaction?
John H. Hammergren: Steven, we did not provide an update, but I can provide an update. I think the level of accretion we expect this year is in line with what we said at the time we did the transaction in that $0.20 to $0.25 range. Clearly, we believe there are some long-term synergies that will be available to us as we get to the outer years of these integrations. But we do believe the business is performing at or above the expectations that we had coming into this. And I also mentioned how pleased I am with the energy level in the business and how well they're performing thus far.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I wanted to just touch on Medical. I know you mentioned that the integration sounds like it's going well with PSS, but I was wondering what you're seeing on the core medical business. On the acute care side, there's been some negative data points throughout earnings here. I was wondering if there was any spillover into the physician space or are you still seeing pretty healthy growth there?
John H. Hammergren: Well, as you know, we sold our acute care business, Robert, some time ago and so we don't have a lot of exposure to acute care or inpatient growth rates. We increasingly have a footprint in organizations that have acute care as part of their mix, these large IDNs that are buying physicians and we're doing extremely well in maintaining and growing our physician business as those acquisitions take place by these large hospital systems. We still see growth in our alternate site markets in that 5% plus or minus kind of range. Remember, we are very well positioned in both the physician market, as well as long-term care. And I'd say exceptionally well positioned also in our Homecare businesses. And so I think we're in the right part of the market from a Medical-Surgical perspective and those businesses continue to perform in line with our expectations.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Great. I understood the current footprint. I was just wondering, given some of the negative data points in the acute side, if you had seen any in the ambulatory side. It doesn't sound like you have. On the share shifts within the retail independents, since it's something that's come up a little bit, with us at least, have you guys noticed any significant market share changes amongst that client base?
John H. Hammergren: Well, these -- the market base is extremely diverse, so you don't see a lot of trends in these businesses very easily because it takes a long time for independent customers to make enough -- enough of them to make any decisions one way or the other to affect sort of the underlying share statistics. Having said all of that, we continue to evolve our programs and focus on adding a significant amount of value to our existing relationships and to provide a platform that really is attractive to our customers where they know they can have a long-term partner that's focused to work alongside them to improve their performance on many different dimensions, not just the cost of distribution but the profitability of their stores. So I think we're very well positioned to continue to grow nicely in the independent space, and obviously, a lot of that is just continuing to earn the privilege of serving our customers in a broader context.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.
Glen J. Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: John, I apologize, but I need to ask one more question on the margins and distribution. When you guys hosted your Analyst Day last month, I think you talked about the manufacture economics on both branded and generics were better than what you thought. And you thought it was a little bit premature at that point to determine if it was just a timing shift or really a trend change in terms of what's going on with the manufacturers. Maybe you could give us a little bit more details as to what you're seeing at the manufacturer level that's maybe translating into such decent margins for you guys?
John H. Hammergren: Well, I think the branded portion of our profit has remained relatively in line with where we expected it to be, slightly -- maybe slightly ahead. But clearly, we've a lot of year left as it relates to those branded relationships and how we're paid in this. I might remind those of you that are sort of new to this, those relationships are kind of predetermined and so the issue is really around the timing associated with those value-creating events of prices with branded manufacturers. On the generics side, we did have very strong performance in our portfolio in the quarter. And to your point, I think it's a little bit premature to call any of the things that we saw from an upside perspective on -- as a trend change. Clearly, our business operations, I think, you can count on continuing to be there and then hopefully we'll continue to have momentum in the way we execute on our generic opportunities. However, on the brand side, we are a little dependent on how those -- excuse me, on the price side, we're a little bit dependent on how those generic manufacturers behave over time, and I think it's really too early to make an industry call relative to trends.
Glen J. Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. If I -- maybe if I could just follow up on your Specialty business. It seems to be that everything is going well there from both the revenue and margin perspective. Obviously, one of your competitors has called out some issues in that business, and I understand the businesses are not apples-to-apples to be compared. But if you think about some of the things going on there, whether it be a little bit more restrictive labeling or transition of the point of care or sequestration having an impact on the community, oncologists, I mean, I'm just surprised that you're not seeing any of that impact to your business or maybe you are?
John H. Hammergren: Well, clearly we see the same stresses on our customer base as exhibited in the entire industry. We are very concerned about the reimbursement pressure that our oncologists are facing and, clearly, we are heavily engaged to make sure that we speak on their behalf and on our behalf to make sure that the reimbursement that goes on in that marketplace stays where it needs to stay and that they're adequately paid for the services they provide. We believe community oncology still provides the lowest cost and best quality alternative in the marketplace. As to our business, I can't really speak for the whole industry. Clearly, the minor variations that may exist relative to reimbursement are really covered in the guidance range that we provided. So we don't think that we will experience something driven by reimbursement alone that will cause us to fall outside of the guidance that we've provided, and so relatively nominal effects, as it relates to what we're trying to do overall. And last I would say that our business model is quite different than our competitors in this marketplace. And you'll notice a pattern here in all of our discussions in our attempt to add value to our relationships in a way that's difficult to price-compete against. And when we're thinking about the total value we can deliver to oncologists in this country, it really is unmatched in that we can help them on almost every dimension of their practice. Including expanding into radiology and other types of service offerings, clearly helping them with getting on the contracts with the payors, helping to become more productive and efficient. All of those things really allow us to have a conversation with a customers that's in significant stress about how they might partner with McKesson to improve their performance. So I do think the market trend may be slightly stressed as a result of reimbursement changes. Clearly, our customers are feeling it. But if we do this properly, McKesson will provide a great vehicle to help them out of the challenge that they face and that we face together.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just a quick one for Erin. Is this the D&A run rate that we should see for the rest of the year? And then maybe for John, just a bit more direct. I can't believe the ongoing debate on Celesio that we're seeing in the media. Is that good for your stock? Is there anything that you could say more directly to that business model, why it might fit, why it would not fit your model?
John H. Hammergren: Well, let me take the Celesio part of that question, then Erin can address the first part of your question. I think that you never know what goes on in the media, particularly in Europe. I'm not that familiar with how these bankers get engaged, and what they might say or might not say and why they would say them or not say them. We've seen noise in these markets before and speculation before, and you just don't know what the motives might be and what's real and what's not real. Clearly, the concern as a shareholder at McKesson, people should have is does that company have the proper scale to compete, do we have the proven track record to use that scale in a way that gives us the best value of delivery to our customers and to the manufacturers we partner with and are we doing it in a way that is intelligent use of the capital that's been entrusted to us by our shareholders? So I think that international expansion clearly can provide scale on some dimensions. The question is it scale that's actionable, can you do something with that buying power? Is it really truly in the control of the distributor and what capital do you have to deploy to do it, and what is it -- how does it translate into a synergy that's worth buying when you add additional complexity. So what you should take away from this, frankly, is we're not closed to any ideas. Our job is to evaluate ideas, including M&A ideas, in a very aggressive and intelligent way. At the same time, you should take away from this, we're not going to be chasing something that somebody else has done or thinks is a good idea, or chasing investment bankers and media on opportunities that we have not clearly determined are in our best interest. So I would dismiss what's in the media just from a standpoint of you just never know where it's headed and why.
Erin Lampert: And, Bob, to address your question on D&A, on the materials that we provided today. Obviously, we've provided updated assumptions on amortization based on the acquisitions that are closed at this time. And I also provided some update, or actually talked about our full year capital spending, which is in line with our original expectations. So I think on the depreciation side, what you see our first quarter run rate is a reasonable approximation of the full year.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ross Muken with ISI Group.
Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: John, you mentioned some progress in the IT business on the GA front, maybe elaborate a bit there. And in general, it seems like a pretty stable environment on the software side but you continue to do well in most of the transaction businesses. Obviously, you're much happier with the performance there. Do you feel like getting rid some of those underperforming pieces will help remove some of the distraction there as well?
John H. Hammergren: Well, clearly, I think the business is able to focus more in the new portfolio and the way the portfolio has been organized. And clearly, the financial condition of the business is -- and its improvement is more apparent as it relates to what we reported in the quarter. We are pleased with the progress at Paragon with the general availability of several of their new modules and that did allow us to, frankly, recognize some revenue that may be slightly pulled forward from the rest of the year's expectation. But I think that we're really -- we're pleased with the progress. And probably as important, as you know, Paragon had commitments to customers related to future delivery and in many ways, evidence of the ability to us -- for us to develop our way to a complete offering that can compete in the marketplace. And this is additional evidence of the development teams' expertise at Paragon and our ability to hit those requirements. So I am pleased with the condition of the business.
Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: And maybe just quickly on Canada. We saw some consolidation up there in terms of 2 of the dispensers. I mean, if that's a trend that continues, I mean, what's your thought about what that means for your business and positioning up there?
John H. Hammergren: We have a very strong long-term relationship with one of the consolidators that was talked about in the quarter, and that's Loblaws. We are the distributor partner for them. And so watching our partners grow is a positive thing for us. Consolidation carries an opportunity and also carries a threat. The threat is that you've got to continue to be refined in your approach and cost effective and add tremendous value as your customers get more and more scale. But on the other hand, it also provides an opportunity for us to bring expertise in a wider-ranging array of abilities across a stronger, or bigger footprint that our customers may be accumulating or amassing. So I think we've done well in worlds that are consolidating in both the U.S. and Canada.
Operator: Our last question comes from David Larsen with Leerink Swann.
David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: Can you just comment, please, on your hospital IT customers' conversion process from Horizon over to Paragon? Our data is coming back pretty positive in terms of your retention of those Horizon clients. I mean, I imagine these Paragon GA items have -- are associated with that?
John H. Hammergren: Thank you for the question. Yes, our data would also indicate that our transition of Horizon customers to Paragon is ahead of the expectations that we had. And the customers that have made these early decisions to make that transition I think have done so with a view that Paragon is the platform of choice, both in terms of its features and function, but also in its total cost of ownership. And as you point out, the further development of the product line and the GAs that we've announced helped solidify the customer's view that this is the product of choice going forward. So we are pleased with the progress. That's not to say that we don't have more work to do and that there aren't existing Horizon customers that are still asking themselves the question of whether or not they should invest in somebody else's platform or if they should take advantage of this unique opportunity to convert to Paragon. So we're hopeful that we will continue to make that progress. I want to thank you, operator, and I want to also thank all of you on the call for your time today. I'm extremely pleased with our strong first quarter performance and excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. And I also want to recognize the outstanding performance of all of our employees and their contribution to these great results. And I'll hand the call off to Erin for her review of upcoming events for the financial community. Erin?
Erin Lampert: Thank you, John. I have a preview of an upcoming event. On November 12, we will present at the Credit Suisse Health Care Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona. We will release second quarter earnings in late October. Thank you for your attention today and goodbye.
Operator: And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the McKesson Corporation fourth quarter earnings call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. And if you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Erin Lampert: Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2013 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. With me today are John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and Jeff Campbell, our CFO. John will first provide a business update and will then introduce Jeff, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After Jeff's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results acquisition-related expenses and related adjustments, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and certain litigation reserve adjustments. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for our investors. Please refer to our press release announcing fourth quarter fiscal 2013 results, available on our website, for a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thanks, and here is John Hammergren.
John H. Hammergren: Thanks, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call today. Today, we reported results for the fourth quarter and full year that reflects strong operating performance across all businesses in our Distribution Solutions segment. We generated $2.5 billion in operating cash flow for the year, capping off another great year of cash flow performance. In addition to completing our acquisition of PSS World Medical in the fourth quarter, we repurchased shares valued at $800 million, bringing our total share repurchases for the year to just over $1.2 billion. As we discussed in our third quarter earnings conference call, we have anticipated the challenge of the low level of new generic launches in our industry and its affect on McKesson in fiscal 2014. As a result, during the fourth quarter, we took a number of strategic and operational actions to position the company for fiscal 2014 and beyond. Today, we also provided fiscal 2014 guidance of $7.90 to $8.20 per diluted share from continuing operations, reflecting solid growth across our broad portfolio of businesses, aided by the continued strength of our balance sheet. Given the challenges we anticipated as we head into fiscal 2014, I believe we have a plan that balances investment for the future and delivering solid financial returns for our shareholders. To summarize our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2013 results, I'm pleased by the strong performance in Distribution Solutions, with all businesses performing ahead of their operating plan for the year. I'm also proud of the strong cash flow and balance sheet, which continue to provide us continued opportunities to create value for our shareholders through our portfolio approach to capital deployment. While the actions we took in the fourth quarter lowered our financial results, I believe we, as a management team, have a responsibility to regularly evaluate our strategy and ensure we position the company for long-term success. Let me step back for a moment and provide some context for the strategic and operational actions we took in the fourth quarter. I would remind you that, on the January earnings call, we talked about a number of actions we plan to take to position the company for the challenges we face in 2014 and beyond. I'll put these actions into 3 broad categories: First, in our Distribution Solutions segment, we completed a strategic evaluation of our minority investment in Nadro, a privately held pharmaceutical distributor in Mexico, where we have a 49% equity interest, and we made the decision to exit our minority investment in this business. Second, we realigned the structure in our Technology Solutions segment during the fourth quarter, to focus in the areas where we have a leading position, improve our efficiency and enhance our ability to continue to innovate on behalf of our customers. As one part of the broader realignment of Technology Solutions, today we announced our intention to exit our International Technology and Hospital Automation businesses. While both of these business have made important contributions to McKesson over the years, they no longer fit with our evolving focus. Finally, we have taken a number of smaller actions across our business to help us meet this short-term challenge, while ensuring our company remains well positioned for the long-term. These actions drove various severance and facility exit charges across both segments and within our corporate group. Through many years of change in our company and in our industry, McKesson has remain committed to our customers' success. We understand clearly that our own performance and growth must be constant, focused and determined if we are to continue to distinguish ourselves for our customers. Now turning to the broader industry environment. Health care topics remain in the national spotlight. Federal and state governments continue to struggle with near-term budget challenges and the longer-term imperative of implementing meaningful health reforms. Reimbursement changes continue to have an impact across the health care industry, with the impact to medical oncology reimbursement drawing recent widespread attention. McKesson is very engaged in advocating on behalf of our oncology physician partners and customers to reinforce the value of community oncology practices across the country. We continue to believe our U.S. oncology model is particularly well positioned to succeed in an environment seeking the highest quality care and the best outcomes at the lowest cost.  The pharmaceutical supply chain continues to evolve with new partnerships and new ideas for addressing global markets. While all health care markets are ultimately local, McKesson has been working globally for many years. Our sourcing expertise and the strength of our relationships with manufacturers across the globe have allowed us to drive efficiencies for our pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical customers. Those customers have, in turn, rewarded McKesson with their continued trust and their partnership as we grow and expand with them. Our customers have urgent needs to improve their processes, reduce their costs and meet increasing regulatory demands. They are looking for a strong partner who can help drive solutions across all of these dimensions. At McKesson, it is the strength and breadth of our products and services, our ability to leverage our significant scale and our broad technology capability that continues to differentiate us with our customers. Now moving on to some of the business results for our fourth quarter and full year. Strong execution in all of our businesses in Distribution Solutions drove full year operating results for the company. Once again, U.S. pharmaceutical delivered outstanding results for the year. In fiscal 2013, we experienced the largest number of brand-to-generic conversions our industry has ever seen, and I'm proud of the performance of our U.S. pharmaceutical business during this unprecedented year. During fiscal 2013, we expanded our total generic pharmaceutical business through continued penetration of our customer base, demonstrating the significant value we deliver through our generics programs. And I'm pleased with the growth and progress in our private label generics business. Due to the size and sophistication of our Global Sourcing capabilities, we also successfully launched our private label generics into the Canadian market in fiscal 2013. A significant accomplishment for the U.S. pharmaceutical team in the fiscal year was the opening of our new state-of-the-art regional distribution center, which continues our long track record of investment in creating the most efficient and effective operating infrastructure in the industry. During the year, we were very pleased to renew a considerable portion of our business in U.S. pharmaceutical. I believe the value we demonstrate year-in and year-out is one of the core reasons we are privileged to have long-standing relationships with our customers. We also continued to perform well for our branded pharmaceutical manufacturing partners and maintained steady levels of compensation and return. In summary, I'm proud of the accomplishments of our U.S. pharmaceutical businesses in fiscal 2013. I believe this business remains extremely well positioned for continued success. Turning to our other businesses in Distribution Solutions. Our Medical-Surgical business delivered strong results, with 15% growth in revenues in fiscal 2013. Solid organic growth and growth from new customers, along with the completion of our acquisition of PSS in February of this year, all contributed to this terrific result. I'm very pleased to welcome Gary Corless and his talented team from PSS to McKesson. While we are still in the early phase of the integration with PSS, I'm very encouraged by the conversations I've had with the integration team, leaders in our business and our sales force and our customers. As with any acquisition of this size and scale, there will be synergies we anticipate in the relatively early stages and other synergies that will take longer to capture. We've assembled a great team to lead this effort, and all of them are passionate about what we can do on behalf of our customers going forward. Our Canadian Distribution business had a solid year and continues to grow its contribution to the overall operating performance of the Distribution Solutions segment. Through consistent execution and innovation, our team in Canada has continued to find ways to grow their operating results. Our business has grown not only as a result of our customers' growth, but also through winning new customers who are looking for a strong partner with a long track record of performance. Our business in Canada continues to perform very well, and I believe we are well positioned to continue our track record of growth in fiscal 2014. Finally, our Specialty business delivered solid financial results by making steady progress in the areas of patient care, growth in the number of physicians who are part of the U.S. oncology network and advances in technology deployed to physicians to assist them in providing better care to their patients. The impact of the sequester on medical oncology reimbursement, which took effect on April 1, has received particular attention over the past month. Now more than ever, both independent oncologists practicing in the community setting and oncologists practicing as part of hospital-affiliated groups need a strong partner who can help them improve their efficiency. With our expertise in managing the business and information technology needs of the oncology care process in the community and hospital settings, the value proposition of U.S. oncology is stronger than ever. Through our U.S. oncology model, which encompasses a full suite of integrated cancer care, including medical oncology, radiation oncology and surgery centers, our team at McKesson specialty health has a deep understanding of the dynamics of community oncology practices. We continue to innovate for our customers, leverage the scale and sourcing expertise of McKesson and provide a compelling value proposition that allows us to grow our business with existing customers and win new customers. This business is performing well, and we expect it will continue this coming fiscal year.  Overall, I'm is extremely pleased with our full year operating performance in Distribution Solutions. As we look ahead to fiscal 2014, in particular, we expect that revenue in Distribution Solutions will rebound significantly for the year as brand-to-generic conversions slow, our existing customers continue to grow and we have a full year result of the acquisition of PSS. Turning now to Technology Solutions. For the year, Technology Solutions revenues were up 3% to $3.4 billion. Full year adjusted operating profit was down 16% to $371 million. Fourth quarter results include the impact of an impairment charge and the costs associated with the realignment of our business in Technology Solutions, which I'll come back to in just a moment. The results of Technology Solutions were below our expectations. We are making a number of changes in the segment to focus in the areas where we have a leading position, and invest in the opportunities where we can innovate for our customers. So let me walk through a few of those to get our focus in the most -- majority part of our effort. Since Pat Blake assumed the leadership for our Technology Solutions segment in 2009, we've been focused on a strategy to improve the performance of our core technology businesses and invest in new growth opportunities. We've made progress toward our goals over the past several years, and the changes we announced today are the next step toward positioning our Technology Solutions segment for the future. We've expanded our capabilities in our RelayHealth and McKesson Health Solutions businesses. In addition to the strength in both of these businesses, we have positioned McKesson to lead in the emerging areas of population health, analytics, value-based reimbursement and connectivity, all areas critical to our customers as they look to the future. Beyond the newly expanded RelayHealth and McKesson Health Solutions, the remaining assets in Technology Solutions have been organized around 3 business areas: our leading medical imaging software franchise, our newly combined ambulatory services and software business, and our electronic health record and revenue cycle solutions. I believe the steps we have taken to further focus our efforts in Technology Solutions leverages the strengths in our portfolio, and allows us to optimize our R&D investments in support of our critically emerging requirements our customers will face over the next several years. Looking forward to fiscal 2014, we expect Technology Solutions revenue growth will accelerate from the level of growth seen in 2013, driven primarily by the acquisitions completed in fiscal 2013, and we expect operating margins at Technology Solutions will rebound strongly in fiscal 2014. In summary, we remain committed to helping our customers use information technology strategically, to enable better business, better care and better connectivity. Before I end, I will spend a few moments talking about capital deployment. We are in a business that continues to generate strong cash flow from operations. We expect that our cash flow from operations will be approximately $2 billion in fiscal 2014. Over time, we've used our portfolio approach to capital deployment for acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and internal investments, creating significant value for our shareholders. And we expect to continue our portfolio approach as we head into fiscal 2014. To wrap up my comments, I believe we have a solid plan as we enter fiscal 2014 that reflects growth across our broad portfolio of businesses, aided by the continued strength of our balance sheet. I'm confident in our team's ability to continue to deliver value to our customers and strong financial returns for our shareholders. We expect fiscal 2014 adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $7.90 to $8.20. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for a detailed review of our financial results. Jeff?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As you just heard, this was another quarter of strong operating performance in Distribution Solutions, capping off a great year of operating performance in this segment. We also had another great year of cash flow and deployed a record amount of capital in the fourth quarter, which contributed significantly to the positive outlook we have for fiscal 2014. Looking forward, we believe that the strategic and operational actions we took in the March quarter better position us for both FY '14 and for the years beyond. In my remarks today, I'll cover both the fourth quarter and full year results. As you know, we provide our guidance on an annual basis, due to both the seasonality and the quarter-to-quarter variability that is inherent in many of our businesses. In this context, an annual look at our financial results can provide more meaningful insight into some of the key trends. So I'll focus more today on the annual numbers than the quarterly ones, and I will also comment on what the trends we see in the annual numbers for FY '13 might mean for fiscal 2014. My comments today will also focus on our full year FY '13 adjusted EPS of $6.33, which as you recall, excludes 3 types of well-defined items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, and certain litigation reserve adjustments. So it is important to note that this full year adjusted EPS of $6.33 includes the impact of the strategic business realignment actions that we took in the March quarter, which are partly a response to the challenges John and I discussed on our January earnings call. These actions collectively resulted in $0.76 of impairment charges and $0.11 of severance and facility exit charges, all of which were recorded in the fourth quarter. So let me start by sorting through these charges. To simplify, our fourth quarter charges, all of which flowed through both our GAAP and adjusted earnings, are made up of 3 items. First, we recorded $191 million noncash pretax impairment charge, or roughly $0.58 of EPS, in our Distribution Solutions segment in the fourth quarter related to our decision to sell our minority investment in Nadro. We called this $191 million noncash pretax impairment charge out in our press tables, immediately below the Other Income line. Second, as part of our recent business structure realignment in Technology Solutions, we recorded $46 million of noncash pretax impairment charges or roughly $0.18 of EPS in the Technology Solutions segment, $36 million of which flowed through the operating expense line. Third, as part of our broader company-wide efforts to offset the headwind of significantly lower generic launches in fiscal 2014, we recorded severance and facility exit charges of $35 million or $0.11 of EPS, spread fairly evenly across both operating segments in the fourth quarter. So with these charges behind us, let's now turn to our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedules 2A and 2B. Consolidated revenues were relatively flat for the full year and down 3% for the quarter. The story behind our revenue performance has been the same all year, as our revenue growth was slowed by the record number of brand-to-generic conversions that occurred in fiscal 2013. Notably, as we look forward to the fiscal 2014, we expect a significant pivot here because of the steep decline in brand-to-generic conversions in FY '14. Through the combination of this sizable slowdown in generic launches and our recent acquisitions, we expect to see significant revenue growth return in fiscal 2014 in both segments. Now as you've heard me say many times before, while generic drugs have a deflationary impact on our top line growth, they certainly are a good thing financially for our company. You see this in our full year adjusted gross profit growth of 6%, as our economics are better on generic drugs. Total adjusted operating expenses for the full year were up 8% to $4.4 billion. Our full year adjusted operating expenses were higher, primarily driven by 3 factors: recent acquisitions contributed $136 million of additional adjusted operating expense; the RAMQ charge, recorded in the third quarter in our Canadian business, added another $40 million; and the fourth quarter noncash Technology Solutions impairment charge added $36 million. When you exclude these 3 items, our full year adjusted operating expenses were up roughly 3% versus the prior year. This is probably the best reflection of what we would expect for our total company adjusted operating expense in fiscal 2014, before adding in the significant additional adjusted operating expenses from our recent acquisitions. Other income for the full year was $35 million. As a reminder, this line is primarily driven by our interest income and also includes the pluses and minuses on various other investments. Generally, we don't expect material changes in this line from year to year. Full year adjusted interest expense decreased $22 million versus the prior year, to $229 million, driven primarily by the repayment of $400 million in long-term debt back in February 2012. Looking ahead, we did raise $1.8 billion of new debt in the last half of fiscal 2013, and we enter fiscal 2014 with our gross debt-to-capital ratio at 40.8%, placing us at the top end of our current target leverage range. In a commentary on the current low interest rate environment, however, we expect our year-over-year interest expense in fiscal 2014 to be fairly flat despite the increase in our debt. Moving down the P&L to taxes. We ended the year with an adjusted tax rate of 31.3%, which is slightly higher than the adjusted tax rate guidance we provided on our Q3 earnings call of 30.5%. The higher rate was driven by a number of discrete items and a slightly less favorable mix of income. Looking forward, our fiscal 2014 outlook assumes an adjusted tax rate of approximately 31%, although it may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Adjusted net income for the full year was $1.5 billion, and our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $6.33. As a reminder, this full year adjusted EPS of $6.33 includes the $0.76 of impairment charges and $0.11 of severance and facility exit charges taken in the fourth quarter. To wrap up our consolidated results, this year's earnings per share number was aided by the cumulative impact of our share repurchases, which lowered our full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding by 5% year-over-year, to 239 million, in line with our original guidance. Going forward, mainly driven by the magnitude of the share repurchases we did in the fourth quarter of FY '13, our diluted weighted average shares outstanding assumption for fiscal 2014 is 231 million. Let's now turn to the segment results, which can be found on Schedules 3A and 3B. Distribution Solutions total revenues were flat for the full year and down 4% for the quarter. Looking at the components, direct distribution and services revenues increased 2% for the full year and 1% for the quarter. Full year and fourth quarter direct revenues increased primarily due to market growth, which was offset by the record number of brand-to-generic conversions in FY '13. As John mentioned earlier, for fiscal 2014, we anticipate direct revenue growth will rebound significantly, driven by the slowing of brand-to-generic conversions and aided by above market growth that we expect from a handful of our largest existing customers. Warehouse revenues declined 9% for the full year and 26% for the quarter. As we discussed over the past several quarters, warehouse revenues are particularly impacted by brand-to-generic conversions. In addition, relative to our original expectations, in FY '13, we saw a shift of existing customer business from warehouse to Direct Store Delivery, which actually is a very good thing for our bottom line, as we have higher margins in the direct revenues. Canadian revenues on a constant currency basis decreased 2% for the full year and 5% for the quarter. As a reminder, the prior year benefited from having 5 extra sales days in fiscal 2012. In the fourth quarter, in addition to the impact we have seen all year from the ongoing generic price reduction challenges in Canada, we were going through a transition with one of our largest Canadian customers. Looking forward to fiscal 2014, we'll complete the customer transition while also benefiting from some recent new customer wins. As a result, we expect to return to significant revenue growth in this business in FY '14, as our team continues to do a great job overcoming the challenging generics regulatory environment. Medical-Surgical revenues were up 15% for the full year and up 37% for the quarter. When you exclude the impact of the PSS acquisition, our fourth quarter revenues increased approximately 10% versus the prior year and our full year revenues increased a healthy 8%, driven by market growth and new customers. We are very pleased with all of these revenue growth numbers, and they provide a strong foundation for fiscal 2014 as we set about the hard work of integrating these 2 great businesses. I would say that our expected view of the PSS first full year operating performance remains unchanged from the initial comments we made on our Q2 earnings call. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit increased 8% for the full year on flat revenues, resulting in a nice improvement in our adjusted gross profit margin. Adjusted operating expense for this segment increased 10% for the full year, driven by the business acquisitions we've made over the past year and the $40 million RAMQ pretax charge in our Canadian business. When you factor out these 2 items, our full year Distribution Solutions adjusted operating expense was up approximately 4% versus the prior year. As reported on Schedule 3B, Distribution Solutions full year adjusted operating profit declined 2% to $2.5 billion, and we ended the year with an adjusted operating margin rate of 207 basis points. I do want to remind you that this full year adjusted operating margin rate, 207 basis points, includes the fourth quarter $191 million noncash pretax impairment charge for Nadro. Looking forward, in fiscal year 2014, we would expect mid-single-digit basis point growth off this FY '13 adjusted operating margin of 207 basis points. Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were up 3% for the full year to $3.4 billion. As noted on Schedule 3B, our full year adjusted operating profit was down 16% to $371 million, and our full year adjusted operating margin rate was 10.91%. Adjusted operating expenses in the segment increased 9% for the full year. And here again, you see the impact of the acquisitions we have made over the past year, as the acquisitions accounted for approximately 3 points of this growth. In addition, $36 million of the fourth quarter asset impairment charges related to the business realignment were recorded in the operating expense line. Technology Solutions gross R&D spending for the year was $492 million, up 9% compared to $451 million in the prior year. Of these amounts, our capitalization rate remained unchanged at 8%. For fiscal 2014, we expect revenue growth in Technology Solutions to be similar to what we experienced in FY '13, before adding in for FY '14 the impact of the various acquisitions we have done. And we expect to be within the low end of our long-term adjusted operating margin goal range of mid-teens. Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. Let me remind you that our financial statements include PSS' entire balance sheet of March 31, 2013, but only 5 weeks of sales for the quarter. As a result, it's more relevant to discuss our working capital metrics, excluding PSS. For receivables, our days sales outstanding, excluding PSS, increased by 1 day versus the prior year to 25 days. Our days sales in inventory of 32 days was up 2 days from a year ago, and our days sales in payables increased to 50 days from 49 days last year, all when you exclude PSS. These working capital metrics, along with our continued focus on cash generation, resulted in cash flow from operations of $2.5 billion. Echoing John's earlier comments, this is at the high end of our original guidance range and is an outstanding result. Our capital structure remains a source of financial strength and earnings growth, and we enter fiscal 2014 with continued financial flexibility. Looking ahead, we expect cash flow from operations to be approximately $2 billion for fiscal 2014. Internal capital spending was $406 million for the year, slightly below our original expectations. You will see our fiscal 2014 guidance assumes an internal capital spending range between $400 million and $450 million. Before I conclude, let me provide a few last bits of context for our fiscal 2014 adjusted earnings guidance range of $7.90 to $8.20 per diluted share. In today's press release, we called out the key guidance assumptions underlying our fiscal 2014 plan, so I won't comment further on most of these assumptions. I would note that one of these key assumptions has always listed the various items not contemplated in the guidance we issued today, such as the impact of any litigation reserve adjustments or the impact of any potential new acquisitions. For FY '14, we are adding LIFO to this list, as the slowdown in brand-to-generic conversions last year could result in LIFO adjustments in FY '14.  Last, I would point out one other item that will impact our fiscal 2014 GAAP and adjusted earnings results. As discussed in today's press release and throughout this earnings call, we have announced our intention to exit our International Technology and Hospital Automation businesses. Beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2014, the results of these businesses will be reported as discontinued operations. So in summary, I've tried, as we've gone through our results, to help you understand how our FY '13 performance supports our fiscal 2014 planned guidance. As always with any plan, there are risks, but we enter fiscal 2014 pleased with the plan we have for the coming year and optimistic about our prospects. Thanks. And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.
Glen J. Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just 2 quick ones, if I could. John, in your sort of prepared remarks, you talked about the health care IT business, and I think you suggested that revs would be up based on some recent acquisitions. But I think you also suggested that the margins would rebound strongly in that business. And I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on what's driving that improved profitability in that segment.
John H. Hammergren: Thanks, Glen, for the question. I think certainly the first thing is we won't have some of the onetime events that are flowing through our adjusted earnings. We talked about some of the changes we did at the end of the year here that caused that to happen. We also don't expect some of the issues we had in the businesses that we plan to put it into discontinued operations, obviously it won't be in part of our adjusted earnings going forward. And probably third and most important, I think we're regaining some of our momentum in these businesses and hope that we will experience a nice margin lift, because of positive mix change and because of just a more focused and performance-oriented process into this year's plan.
Glen J. Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. Maybe if I can just ask one follow-up on the distribution segment and, Jeff, I want to make sure I kind of heard you correctly. We're looking for improved revenue growth in drug distribution due to the factors you kind of talked about. And I thought you said maybe for the operating profit assumption, we'd be up mid- to high-single digit basis points off of an adjusted number in the base year because of the impairment. Did I hear that correctly?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, let me be very clear. So if you look at FY '13, Glen, you see a 207 basis point margin rate in Distribution Solutions for the year, and that does include the Nadro impairment. As we look at FY '14, we'd expect a mid-single-digit basis point improvement off that 207. And I think what's important to realize here are 2 things. Number one, that, as we've been talking about for a very long time, you have a really unprecedented 1 year drop, in our fiscal year, in the number of brand-to-generic conversions, and that is a significant impact on our margin rate. Sort of related is you have tremendous growth returning on the revenue line, particularly around brand and particularly where we expect even a little above-market growth from some of our largest existing customers, where the business is mostly brand. So you have really factored into that margin rate assumption for FY '14, both the brand-to-generic conversion downside and the fact that you're going to have a big revenue number that obviously has a dampening effect on the margins.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: We've been hearing a lot about creating global scale recently, and you just exited Mexico, obviously, one particular market. But do you think that you need to go global to further improve your sourcing?
John H. Hammergren: I think that we generally don't comment on our market expansion plans, and we have and will continue to consider many strategic options, both within and outside the United States. And as in the past, we'll pursue those options and find the ones that drive the most value for our shareholders. I think we have significant scale today. And clearly, our sourcing programs are quite significant. And we think we have very good relationships. And we have been working globally for many years to drive efficiencies and source private-label products for our pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical supply customers. So in the end, we think we have very significant scale today and terrific sourcing capabilities and expertise that we refined over decades, actually. And I believe we're doing a great job for our customers and we'll remain very well positioned. But does not mean that we're not going to continue to evolve and innovate for the future. And the partnership you refer to, that was recently announced, is an important industry move, but it's not going to change our strategy. And at the same time, however, our management philosophy is that, in order to keep our leadership position, we have to constantly evolve and be open to new approaches and ideas.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Ricky, I'd also, just on the specific question of Mexico, remind you that this is a minority investment for us, where we had no management control or position. And it's probably not so much a commentary on the market as it is just on the fact that the governance didn't work for us.
John H. Hammergren: And I would say, in follow up to that, the governance in Canada has worked for us in our ability to leverage our skills, across both the U.S. and Canada it's proven to be quite effective. So I think had we, perhaps, had a different position in Mexico, we would have had a different result.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then just to clarify on the margin question, so when we back up the charges and the benefit, we get to operating profit margin of around 3.07% in Distribution segment for the quarter, so very nice expansion. So I just wanted to make sure that we're thinking about that number correctly. And then as we think about fiscal year '14 guidance, I think the reported number was 2.07%. Once we back off that, we get back of the envelope to around 2.20%, 2.22%. Should we use that number as we model fiscal year '14?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, to be clear on fiscal year '14, Ricky, what we're saying is, off the 207 number for FY '13, we would expect mid-single-digit basis point growth, because of the very significant dampening impact of a rebound in revenue growth and the drop-off in brand-to-generic conversions.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And that's includes already the positive margin contribution from PSS?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Correct.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: John, I just wanted to follow up on some of your thoughts on the overall distribution market right now. I mean, clearly, there's been a number of changes in contracts over the last several months. You've renewed your contract with CVS. But can you maybe just give us some of your thoughts around the overall competitive and pricing environment today?
John H. Hammergren: Sure, Lisa. I see a market that is competitive today, just as it has always been, I guess. And while there has been some attention recently to some of these big customer switches in the industry, I think we've been very pleased to have renewed a large portion of McKesson's U.S. pharmaceutical business headed into this fiscal '14. And those renewals are actually more of our base than we typically would experience in a typical year. So we're quite pleased that we have continued to renew those partnerships. And I think it's really based on our broad capabilities and our track record for driving substantial financial efficiencies for our customers. It is terrific service levels, and I mentioned the fact that we're opening up our renewed or replacement RDC, which is going to be, I think, a continued big hit for our customers. And I think our customers have continued to choose us because we provide the best value proposition on a myriad of dimensions. And so I'm quite pleased with it and I think we're quite optimistic as it relates to, at least, our position with our customers going into the next fiscal year.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then just as my follow up, I know you made comments earlier around the value proposition you offer around oncology. Maybe, Jeff, can you talk about any kind of earnings impact that you'll have for any headwinds on the oncology distributions side -- I'm sorry on the oncology reimbursement side, whether it's a shift from ASP plus 6, were other cuts due to sequestration?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, Lisa, clearly, the cuts for oncologists as part -- that happened as part of the sequestration, are a serious issue for our physician customers. When you step back, when you think about the overall scale of McKesson and the size or specialty business relative to the whole company and our role, I would say that it's not a material item for McKesson, even within the guidance range that we've given you. I think we'd also make -- I'd go back to some of the points John made in his comments, which is we also believe that the overall model we've developed in our specialty business is particularly attractive to physicians and practices at times when reimbursement is really putting a lot of pressure on the practices.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And just so I understand, are you seeing a pickup in the number of physicians that are now coming under that model for U.S. oncology, because of the tough brand reimbursement environment?
John H. Hammergren: I think it's too early to suggest that the sequester, which only began to take effect April 1, had any impact on our quarter. I would say, Lisa, though, that if you think about what we've been doing over time, is evolving the strategy so that we can compete in a way that our customers look at us differently, perhaps, than others in the marketplace. And they come to us as a place that can help them improve their operating performance in ways that simple price discounts on distribution can't provide. And so the partnership we've created with U.S. oncology physicians is quite significant. And we have seen a nice increase in the number of physicians who have joined the U.S. oncology network during last fiscal year. So our comments are really pre-sequester comments related to physician adoption of our model. Clearly, we think the pressure is a 2-edged sword. It clearly is a negative impact as it relates to the current economics of physicians that are outside of the benefit that we can provide in a more holistic way and, to some extent, a drag on those inside of our network. But we work very well with our doctors to help offset those negatives to the extent that we can. And clearly, doctors that are not in the network are attracted to a place where they can find an expanded partnership that can help them deal with some of those challenges. So much like what we found with Health Mart and independent pharmacies, sometimes the pressure that's exerted causes people to open their minds to a different model that will expand their ability to operate more profitably.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with UBS.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So you obviously have a lot to sort through here in a short amount of time. But I guess when we talk about these collective exit, realignment and restructuring charges in the fiscal fourth quarter of '13, is there any color just on how material the EPS savings are expected to be in the new fiscal '14 EPS guidance? So would that range of $7.90 to $8.20 have been completely different if you didn't take these actions, or it would have been around the same range? Just trying to get more color on the EPS.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: That's a fair question, Steven. The short answer is no, it wouldn't have materially changed. Our Nadro -- remember, Nadro is just an investment. So the equity earnings on that have been de minimis in recent years. And the combination of our International Technology business and our automation business was also de minimis when you look at FY '13. For FY '14, now it depends a little bit on how the transactional process goes here, but we'll report all that in the discontinued ops line. The bottom line is that this $7.90 to $8.20 EPS from continuing operations is not significantly impacted by any of those 3.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then quickly, not to make you put on your political prediction hat, but I know there is a bill in the House that calls for the removal of the oncology drug sequester cuts. I guess the way you see it now, do you think there is maybe a reasonable chance that these cuts could be reversed? Or is it more in the category of not holding your breath? Or do you just not want to comment on probabilities on that?
John H. Hammergren: Well, while the beginning of the political spectrum is difficult to comment on, and I certainly don't want to put myself in the shoes of the policymakers, I do think that oncologists have been perhaps more uniquely impacted in a negative way than the general health care industry through the sequester. And so we're very sympathetic and supportive of the moves to help our physicians get outside of this, what we think is an unfair and perhaps more heavily impacting their business model than others in the sector. Having said all of that, I think our financial forecasts for this year, going forward, are not going to be materially impacted one way or the other relative to the sequester. And so we feel comfortable that, as a corporation, we can work through these challenges. Clearly, at the physician level, depending on their mix of business, that's Medicare, Medicaid kind of oriented, the larger the impact. And we're working on those physician customers to try to find efficiencies to offset those hits.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: I guess sort of 2 housekeeping questions, if I could. First, fiscal '13 cash flow was very strong, as you mentioned, Jeff, down, I guess, a bit year-over-year based on your expectations for fiscal '14. Generic profitability is a difficult comp. Can you talk about any other key moving parts that we should be thinking about there on the cash side?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: No, the drop, Tom, in the guidance for '14 versus '13 is just the classic day of week that the relative years happen to end on. And given the magnitude of our revenues and receivables and payables, when you get a Monday or a Friday, is a huge difference. And that's really the main driver of the decline.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. So '13 was maybe exaggerated a little bit up by timing and '14 exaggerated down, so the differential in reality isn't all that extreme.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: I think that's an excellent way to look at it.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then I think you also mentioned in the text of the release on fiscal '14 outlook, you're expecting branded and generic price trends to sort of be similar in '14 as '13. Can you tell us what you saw in those 2 areas?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, yes, although I'll give you the caveat that every company and every consultant measures inflation differently. On the branded side for our internal purposes, we measure inflation looking at our particular product mix and doing a dollar-volume weighted calculation of the average price increase. And that is influenced not just by the average size of the price increase, but by how many you have, and some products take more than one in a year. When you do all that calculation, our index was in the 10% to 11% range last year, and we expect that same kind of range next year. The generics side is even trickier to talk about a number, because we model every new launch individually. For mature products, we calculate a dollar volume weighted average of how the overall price trends are going. As you know, if you go back 4 or 5 years, that indices used to often go down quite significantly, 10% or 15% a year. In recent years, it's been flat to up a little bit to down a little bit, and that's the same kind of trend we would anticipate for next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Jeff, on the last call, you did reference $46 million in deferred Technology revenues. I assume nothing was recognized in the fourth quarter. And did the divestitures impact that number at all?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, to be clear, you're correct that, on the particular sales that we deferred in the December quarter, none of that was recognized in the March quarter. To be clear, we have lots of other ongoing business in that International Technology business, where the revenue continues to be recognized, and we have a great contract with the NHS, and we have lots of legacy clinical business, and all of that continues to just be recognized as is. But of the deferral piece, you are quite correct, that none of it was recognized in the March quarter. If look at FY '14, that entire business will now be reported down in discontinued operations, along with our Hospital Automation business and the revenues and profits of those business, as well as the costs and gains associated with their sales, will ultimately all flow through that line.
John H. Hammergren: Robert, we do not expect any of those revenues to be recognized in this quarter as well. So there was no change in our plan there.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And John, I heard a strong yes and a strong no on the international expansion. Can you -- kind of what's the disconnect? We're getting pitched these wonderful synergies of international collaboration. The rest of the industry seems to say wait and see, and you seem very much on the fence as well. Is there a stronger statement you could make one way or the other on that?
John H. Hammergren: Well, it's been our practice really not to talk about our strategy until it's ready to be revealed. I guess the point is that we think we have significant scale today. We don't think that our success is dependent on some type of a joint purchasing program or some type of an acquisition. Having said all of that, we also think that we can be successful on an ongoing basis by keeping our minds open and evolving our strategy and being aware of what our markets are doing. So at this point, I wouldn't count on us doing anything, and I wouldn't count us out on doing anything. I think the focus has to be on remaining agile in our approach. And I think you can -- if you look at our history as a company, we have -- we sometimes missed an opportunity and sometimes we missed a problem, and we'd like to keep that track record going. So we're going to continue to think about what we need to do, if anything, in addition to just outright execution everyday against a strategy we've had in place. We've been doing this private label generics thing for almost a decade now, from the beginning of the thought process to the execution we have today, and now we're bringing it to Canada. These are not easy things to do, and it takes a long time to do them right. And we're certainly not going to mess up our reputation or our customers' confidence in us by going halfhearted at something. And usually, like we did in that private label, we don't talk about it until it's successful.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just a couple on PSS. Jeff, I understand that you're saying that your operating performance expectations for PSS are unchanged. But if I go back, I think the original guidance, EPS guidance, that it's based off of a much higher interest rate than what you ended up securing. Would you mind sharing with us just what the actual new EPS contribution range is? Or is it as simple as just applying what the final rate was in order to get what you're thinking about EPS contribution from PSS in '14?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, the short answer is really what you just said at the end there. But just to level set for everyone, back in the original earnings call, we said, just to help people work through the math, that if you were to 100% debt-finance PSS at a 4% interest rate, we'd expect the resultant accretion to be $0.15 to $0.25. If you look at the last 6 months, we've done a couple of financing, raised about $1.8 billion, at an average interest rate of about 2.1%, not 4%. So if you were to plug 2.1% into that calculation instead of 4%, it would add about another $0.05 to the accretion. It's always a little bit tricky to say, "Well, does that debt all serve to finance PSS or did part of it fund the $800 million of share repurchase we did in the March quarter, cash funded [ph] ?" But I'm just trying to help people understand, however you want to model the capital structure, our view of the earnings power of PSS remains unchanged.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then, I guess, just a broader question on the medical market share in ambulatory. We saw some significant growth from one of your U.S. competitors in the ambulatory space reported earlier today. I'm just wondering if you would comment on your positioning there, maybe how the transition has been going early days and specifically any comments around sales force engagement since the deal had been announced?
John H. Hammergren: Well, you can see in our prepared remarks, we had tremendous revenue growth, both pre-integration of the PSS number, and once you put it in, obviously, it grew even more nicely. But both PSS and McKesson, independently, grew very nice in the quarter. And you know that our footprint is quite significant in the physician or ambulatory space. That includes surgery centers. It includes independent physicians. It includes physicians that are owned by hospitals. It includes home health care. It includes long-term care. And so we do believe we have the strongest footprint in the industry in all of those settings of care. And we're really pleased that we've been able to evolve our product offering, our strategy, our technology in a way that enhances our go-to-market strategy. And so I think what you're at least seeing from us, and perhaps others are following, is a more holistic approach to the market and to the challenges our customers face. And as you also know, although we are quite significant now in the nonhospital or non-acute care settings, we have significant opportunity to grow because the market is highly fragmented. And our ability to attract new customers based on our value prop, we think will continue. As to the integration of the team at PSS, I think everybody remains engaged and enthusiastic. I mentioned Gary Corless on my phone call, and I also want to put a shout out to Stanton McComb. The 2 leaders of that business have come together with their teams and are doing a great job of putting the integration plans together. Our going-in assumption was that we would not lose a sales rep and, certainly, not eliminate one on purpose. And I can tell you that we've had almost 100% retention -- not quite, but almost 100% retention of our field selling forces. And we're working out the territory overlaps and the customers, and we feel quite confident we'll retain our people and we'll retain our customers. We're excited about that. Now clearly over time, there'll be some difficult decisions to make on synergies and taking cost out of our networks. But we have such a large opportunity here, we think that any employee negatively impacted should have an opportunity to explore other opportunities inside of McKesson. So we're off to a good early start. The businesses are performing well, and our customers are reacting very favorably.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: My main questions are taken care of, so I'll just ask a quick one. I heard on the call several times about a fee pivot in revenue, a significant rebound, et cetera. The Street was modeling fiscal 2013 a little higher, so the growth rate is not exactly comparable, but the Street was looking for about 2.6% revenue growth in fiscal '14. My sense is that fee pivots and significant rebounds are more than 3% growth. So I'm hoping you can just give us a little more sense on what you are really signaling here.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Yes, the short answer to your question, significant pivot, significant growth is well beyond 2.6%. We're always a little cautious, Eric, to give an overly precise number, because our revenue growth will be dominated by just pharmaceutical distribution. And it will be, in particular, dominated by the couple of large customers and exactly what their purchasing patterns are around brand. And of course, the impact on our bottom line of all that is far less than the impact on the revenue growth. All that said, our view probably of the markets' growth itself is probably a little more robust than I think some other pundits out there. Our view of our own customers growth, particularly a couple of large customers, is that when we look at their pipelines, we expect a few of our larger customers to grow above the market. And then you do have the added impact of just the math of adding in PSS. So in our Distribution Solutions segment, which drives the revenue growth for the whole company, we would expect to be much higher than the 2.6% you just cited.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: That's fair. And if I could just one add-on, is the growth related to one of the better new drug approval years from the last 15 at the FDA, or is it that you're seeing market volumes and just customer mix, as you mentioned, being stronger?
John H. Hammergren: Well, clearly, we're optimistic about new drug approvals, but I think that much of our view on revenue growth is being driven just by the growth our customers are going to receive this year and the lack of a dilutive effect of significant generic launches, which were pulling back our revenue in previous years. And clearly, just like Jeff said, there's a -- I think we have a more positive view on overall revenue growth for the industry than perhaps some others might have, because of this generic pullback.
Operator: We'll take our next question from David Larsen with Leerink Swann.
David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: Jeff, can you just comment on the sequential decline in direct and bulk revenue, please?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, let me take those backwards. If you look at bulk revenue, remember, that's less than a handful of our large customers, for whom we do a warehouse service as part of a much broader relationship. Some of the good news about the sequential decline is it's driven by some of those large customers putting more of their business through our direct model, which is actually much better for us. So that's really the story on warehouse. On direct, it's really just a function of the way the brand-to-generic conversions have rolled out through the year and, of course, it's the reversal of that trend, beginning next quarter and then really happening to a much greater extent as you get into the second, third and fourth quarters of FY '14, that causes such a pivot in the revenue growth rates.
David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: Okay, and then just one more. You mentioned a potential, I think, LIFO charge for fiscal '14. That is included, I think, in your adjusted EPS. That's new from previous year's guidance. Any color around the size of that?
John H. Hammergren: Well, it's not in our guidance, but it would be included in our adjusted result. We won't adjust it out, if that's the question you're asking.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: It is so hard, David, to forecast this because it's a mathematical calculation we do once a year, which is driven by a methodology developed over 30 years ago, when the company first started doing LIFO accounting. And once you start it, you can never adjust it. And it is just very hard to predict. What we do know, however, is that the significant change in FY '14, in terms of the number of brand-to-generic conversions, will cause that calculation, potentially, to be significantly different than it has been. That's why we're calling it out, just so people understand that we have not included that in our guidance.
Operator: And our last question comes from George Hill with Citi.
George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Jeff, a little bit of an accounting question for you. Am I thinking about the IT segment right, where the Better Health 2020 investment spend, the bulk of that should be behind us as we go into fiscal 2014 and is that contributing to the margin improvements?
John H. Hammergren: Actually our investment -- if you listened to Jeff's comments, our R&D investment actually goes up in fiscal '14, so I think that we are -- versus '13, and I think you'll see that we are continuing to invest against that strategy. So we are not de-investing in the business yet, plus you know we have -- we'll have full year effect of some acquisitions we did in the prior year as well. So I think over time, we're hoping to get the return on investment from increased revenues and an improved mix in the business as opposed to reducing our investment in the business. Well, I want to thank all of you and thank the operator for our help today and for paying attention to the call. We do have a solid plan for fiscal 2014, combining our expectations for expanded revenue growth in both of our segments and continued capital deployment. I'm proud of our track record of delivering value to our customers and strong financial returns to our shareholders. And I want to acknowledge all of our employees here at McKesson for their passion and commitment to our goal of bringing better health to our customers and the patients they serve. With that, I'll turn it over to Erin for a view of the upcoming events for the financial community.
Erin Lampert: Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events. We will participate in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Health Care Conference in Las Vegas on May 15 and The Goldman Sachs Health Care Conference in Ranchos Palos Verdes on June 11. We will release first quarter earnings results in late July. We look forward to seeing you at one of these upcoming events. Thank you, and goodbye.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert.
Erin Lampert: Thank you, Amber. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2013 Third Quarter Earnings Call. With me today are John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and Jeff Campbell, our CFO. John will first provide a business update and will then introduce Jeff, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After Jeff's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities law. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results acquisition expenses and related adjustments, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and certain litigation reserve adjustments. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for investors. Please refer to our press release announcing third quarter fiscal 2013 results available on our website for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thanks, and here is John Hammergren.
John H. Hammergren: Thanks, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Today we reported third quarter results with total company revenues of $31.2 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.41. Distribution Solutions continues to turn in solid results, and our view of the full year operating performance of the business has improved from our original expectations. However, third quarter financial results in the Distribution Solutions segment were impacted by a $40 million pretax charge related to a legal dispute in our Canadian business. In our Technology Solutions segment, again our primary businesses performed well in the third quarter, and our view of their full year operating performance remains unchanged. Third quarter results and our view for the full year are impacted by revenue deferral on certain products in our international business. So overall for the full year, our improved outlook of the operating performance and Distribution Solutions allows us to offset the revenue deferral in our international technology business and much of the charge in our Canadian business. As a result, we are updating our outlook for the fiscal year and now expect to achieve adjusted earnings per diluted share of $7.10 to $7.30 for fiscal 2013. Before I turn the call over to Jeff for a detailed review of our financial results, I will provide some highlights from both segments of our business. Within our Distribution Solutions segment, our U.S. pharmaceutical business led the way with solid operating results for the quarter. We continue to benefit from our strong and long-standing relationships with brand manufacturers, where we deliver a broad range of value-added services and remain a valued supply chain partner. We also continue to benefit from the growth in generic pharmaceuticals. In calendar 2012, we saw the largest number of generic launches the industry has seen to date, and we are pleased to deliver great value to our generics customers with the breadth of our portfolio, our supply chain expertise and our high service levels. Compared to calendar 2012, calendar 2013 stands out for the particularly low number of expected generic launches for the year. And we have talked publicly about the challenge that creates for our U.S. pharmaceutical business in our fiscal 2014. That said, we also view the opportunities in our generics business in the following years quite favorably. So we remain excited about the future of this business and our opportunity to continue to bring innovative services, technology and products to support the future growth in generics. Turning to our results in Canada. Our Canadian distribution business had solid revenue and gross profit growth in the core operations of the business in the third quarter. We are approaching the 1 year anniversary of our acquisition of the Katz Banner business, and as I've mentioned in previous quarters, we remain very pleased with this acquisition. We continue to see good growth in the number of independent pharmacies operating within the acquired Katz Banner business, and we use trade names like Drug Trading and the Medicine Shoppe Canada to grow our business. McKesson Canada has a long history of supporting independent pharmacy through our banner offering. We have a strong track record of improving the efficiency of store operations and providing great value for our banner members who also benefit from the focused leadership team in McKesson Canada dedicated to developing and delivering services tailored to the needs of the independent pharmacy. We continue to see tremendous momentum in our Medical-Surgical business as we benefit from the growth in our alternate site markets and our ability to win new customers and certainly from the contribution from tuck-in acquisitions. Our McKesson Medical-Surgical customers from the small physician practice to larger groups of physicians practicing as part of an integrated delivery network see increasing value in working with a partner who understands the unique requirements and challenges of the physician business. With respect to the acquisition of PSS World Medical, we were pleased to receive notification of early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act at the end of the third quarter. This was an important step in the process of completing our acquisition of PSS. I've had the opportunity to spend time with key members of both our Medical-Surgical team and the PSS team. They're all excited about the opportunities they see to combine the best of both businesses and bring increased valued to our physician and extended care customers. We expect to close the acquisition during our fourth quarter, and I'm looking forward to welcoming the PSS team members into McKesson. In summary, I'm pleased with the operating performance in our Distribution Solutions segment for the third quarter, and I'm confident in our improved outlook for our full year operating performance. Turning now to Technology Solutions. For the third quarter, revenues were flat, and adjusted operating margins were 11.9%. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, Q3 results were impacted by revenue deferral on certain products in our international business. For those of you who may not be familiar with our international business, let me take a moment to give you a brief overview. Our international technology business offers workforce and healthcare system solutions primarily in the United Kingdom. Our workforce solutions help the National Health Service recognize the full benefits of their electronic staff records as a strategic workforce management system. And our healthcare solutions deliver a range of technology products to hospitals, surgery centers and clinics throughout the United Kingdom. In fiscal 2012, we acquired a software provider in the U.K. called System C. System C brings updated systems to our acute care customer base, and we've been pleased with the customer response to our expanded offering and the resulting bookings experienced in the business. As we enhanced our products to address the evolving needs of the market and as we work with our customers on the pace of implementations, we have determined it is appropriate to defer revenue on certain products to future periods. This decision impacts our outlook for the rest of the year, which Jeff will discuss in further detail in his remarks. Moving on to the rest of our Technology Solutions segment. Our RelayHealth business and our payer software business, which combined to contribute just over 50% of the operating profits of the segment, continue to perform well and deliver steady growth. Customers are increasingly seeking the technology in our RelayHealth business as they look to establish clinical and financial connections between healthcare providers in the community. RelayHealth is an important partner, delivering innovative solutions to efficiently manage revenue cycle. And we also help providers better engage patients in their care and collaborate with the patient's other providers regardless of their technology infrastructure. For our payer customers, healthcare reform has created an intense focus on reducing administrative waste and finding new ways to work with providers to become more connected and, in some cases, to share risk for patient care and outcomes. As the largest solutions provider for payers in the U.S., McKesson understands the technology and analytics required to best support both payers and providers as they experiment with new models in patient care. And finally, turning to our Provider Technologies business. Approximately 1 year ago, we announced a series of product strategy changes in our hospital business to converge our core clinical and revenue cycle solutions onto the Paragon platform. We are pleased that more customers than we had originally anticipated have either already moved to Paragon or have confirmed their intention to move to Paragon. We're also very pleased that Paragon was once again named the Best in Class in the Community Hospital Information Systems category for the seventh consecutive year. In addition, Paragon was rated #2 in overall software suite rankings for the second consecutive year, reflecting the attractiveness of the solution to the large hospital marketplace. In summary, the core operating performance in our Distribution Solutions business remains solid, and our outlook for the full year has improved from our original expectations. While we are disappointed with the revenue deferral in our international business, the primary businesses in Technology Solutions continue to perform well. We're fortunate to be in businesses that generate healthy cash flows. And over time, we've used our portfolio approach to capital deployment to create value for our shareholders. Consistent with this approach, I am pleased to announce that our Board of Directors increased the company share repurchase program by $500 million. We also expect to close our acquisition of PSS World Medical late in our fiscal fourth quarter. The strength of our business provides us the continued financial flexibility to create value for our shareholders through our capital deployment program, which continues to be portfolio-based. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As you've just heard, we are pleased by the operating strength in our Distribution Solutions business as we look towards the full year, and the primary businesses in our Technology Solutions segment continue to perform well. There are a number of complexities to our results this quarter, which I'll try to sort out as we walk through our financial results. I would summarize now, however, by saying there were 3 aspects to our financial results that I would draw particular attention to this afternoon. First, and perhaps most important when thinking about our business going forward, is the nice strength we are seeing in our Distribution Solutions segment operating results as we look towards the full year. Second, is the charge we took for the legal dispute in our Canadian business of $40 million, which, to be clear, we do include in our adjusted earnings. Third is the revenue deferral in our international business and Technology Solutions. I'll cover each of these as I go through my remarks. My comments today on our earnings will focus on our $1.41 adjusted earnings per share, which, as you recall, excludes 3 types of items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments and certain litigation reserve adjustments. The numbers I will review in my discussion today will be based on an adjusted earnings basis and can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 included in today's press release. Let me begin by reviewing our consolidated results for the quarter, which can be found on Schedule 2A. Consolidated revenues were up 1% to $31.2 billion for the quarter, as we again see a large volume of brand-to-generic conversions slowing our revenue growth. This is, of course, a good thing for our business, and you see this in looking at our adjusted gross profit, which grew 6% to $1.7 billion. Total adjusted operating expenses for the quarter increased 13% to $1.1 billion. While this increase seems large on its face, there were 3 primary drivers to this increase. First, the $40 million pretax charge in our Canadian business represented approximately 4% of this expense growth. To provide a little background for this, as we've previously reported in our SEC filings, McKesson has for a number of years cooperated and responded to an investigation by the agency known as RAMQ, which is a provincial government agency with authority over the conduct of pharmaceutical business in the province of Québec. In the third quarter of 2013, we engaged in settlement discussions to resolve potential legal claims against the company and our customers and suppliers. In consideration of the pace and progress of settlement discussions, which are at an advanced stage, we recorded a pretax charge of $40 million for the estimated probable loss from potential legal claims arising from the investigation. Turning back to the overall increase in operating expense. The second factor was the acquisitions we've made over the last year, which added roughly another 3% to our expense growth. Finally, our corporate expenses for the quarter are up $27 million year-over-year, which was approximately another 3% of the operating expense growth for the total company. Let me remind you, though, that we typically see a fair amount of variability from quarter-to-quarter in our corporate expense line. For the full year, we expect our corporate expenses to be approximately flat versus the prior year. Adjusting for all 3 of these factors, our overall operating expenses are tracking more in line with the normal growth we would expect. Other income for the quarter was $10 million. As a reminder, last year's third quarter other income was impacted by an asset impairment recorded in our corporate segment. Interest expense declined $6 million versus the prior year to $58 million, driven primarily by the repayment of $400 million in long-term debt in February of fiscal 2012. As I projected on our earnings call last quarter, we did proceed with issuing $900 million in long-term debt in December to refinance the $400 million in debt that was repaid in February 2012 and to prefund a $500 million maturity coming due this March. So to be very clear, the December $900 million financing was just a refinancing of existing debt and is independent of the PSS transaction. To turn to the financing for PSS, our latest thinking is that we will likely finance a little less than 1/2 of the transaction with permanent debt sometime subsequent to the closing of the acquisition. We now have a bridge facility in place to fund the close itself. Moving now to taxes. In the third quarter, we recognized some unfavorable discrete tax items, which drove our adjusted tax rate up to 32% for the quarter. We continue, however, to estimate that our full year adjusted tax rate will remain at 30.5%. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $340 million, and our adjusted earnings per share was $1.41. To wrap up our consolidated results, weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased 4% for the quarter to $240 million. This year-over-year decline was primarily due to the cumulative impact of our share repurchases. For the full year, we continue to expect our average diluted shares to come in around our original guidance assumption of 239 million shares outstanding. Let's turn now to our segment adjusted earnings results, which can be found on Schedule 3A. In Distribution Solutions, total revenues were up 1% for the quarter versus the prior year. Looking at the components, direct distribution and services revenues were up 4% year-over-year for the quarter to $22.4 billion. The key drivers of this were market growth and having one extra sales day. Our warehouse revenues declined 14% year-over-year as the large volume of brand-to-generic conversions particularly impacts our warehouse revenues. While our total U.S. pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues are roughly in line with our expectations year-to-date, we have seen a shift of existing customer business from warehouse to direct store delivery. Canadian revenues on a constant currency basis grew 3% for the quarter, primarily due to market growth and having one extra sales day in the quarter. Medical-Surgical revenues were up a strong 15% for the quarter to $874 million, driven by market growth and new customers. The quarter also benefited from an acquisition and from having one extra sales day. These 2 items combined, however, account for only about 4% of the overall 15% growth. So we are particularly pleased to see this kind of continued strong growth in our Medical-Surgical business. And with the acquisition of PSS expected to close later this quarter, we are well positioned to carry this momentum forward. Adjusted gross profit in Distribution Solutions increased 7% for the quarter to $1.3 billion, representing an adjusted gross margin improvement of 24 basis points versus the prior year. We did, of course, have strong growth in oral generic profits this quarter. However, the increase in generic profit was partially offset by the expected decline in sell margin that was primarily driven by the BA. In addition, while our view of our brand manufacturer economics for the full year has grown more positive relative to our original expectations, less came in the third quarter and more has shifted to the fourth quarter. One other point, we did benefit in the third quarter from $8 million in antitrust settlements. Our Distribution Solutions adjusted operating expenses were up 15% for the quarter to $725 million. Once you factor out the $40 million pretax charge as well as the various acquisitions, the number is more in line with what we would usually expect. The adjusted operating margin rate for the segment was 187 basis points this quarter versus 191 basis points a year ago. For the full year fiscal 2013, we continue to expect Distribution Solutions adjusted operating margin improvement in the high-single-digit basis points. Eventually, the operating strength we are seeing across the segment should at least offset the charge for the legal dispute in our Canadian business. Turning now to Technology Solutions. Total revenues were flat for the quarter at $826 million. The revenue deferrals that John discussed in our International business lowered our revenues in the quarter by approximately $16 million, and we have lowered our full year expectation by approximately $30 million. These revenues essentially would have fallen straight to the bottom line. As a result, adjusted operating profit in our Technology Solutions segment this quarter was $98 million, and our adjusted operating margin was 11.9%. This is obviously below our original expectations. As a result of these developments, turning to the full year, we still expect our revenues in MTS to approximate the level of growth experienced in fiscal 2012. The weaker revenues we now expect in our international business will be roughly offset by the acquisitions we closed in the third quarter. On the operating margin side, we now expect our adjusted operating margin in Technology Solutions to approximate the level we saw in fiscal 2012. Leaving our segment performance and turning now to the balance sheet and our working capital metrics. Our receivables were $10 billion, up from the prior year balance of $9.7 billion, and our days sales outstanding were unchanged to 25 days. Inventories were flat for the quarter at $10.4 billion, with our days sales in inventory of 32 days also flat to prior year. Compared to a year ago, payables were down 4% to $15 billion. Our days sales in payables of 46 days was 2 days below last year. Year-to-date, we've generated $276 million in operating cash flow. As you know, our cash flow varies from quarter to quarter depending on seasonal and timing factors. In addition, as Paul Julian talked about at our Investor Day in June, earlier this year, our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution business opened a new national redistribution center through which we flow a significant portion of our inventory. We have managed this transition conservatively and have built up some extra inventory to ensure we meet customer needs. This is lower than our operating cash flow year-to-date, but as the transition is close to conclusion, overall we do not expect it to have an impact on our full year. So we continue to expect our cash flows from operations for the full year to be between $2 billion and $2.5 billion, though I do think it's more likely now that we'll be in the low end of that range. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.7 billion. Of this amount, approximately $1.5 billion was offshore. Our capitalized spending was $268 million for the first 9 months of the fiscal year, and we now expect to come in a little bit below the low end of our prior range of $425 million to $475 million. Overall, our gross debt to capital ratio was 37% for the quarter and remains within our target range of 30% to 40%. We did spend roughly $360 million on share repurchases in the third quarter. And as John mentioned earlier, we are pleased that the Board of Directors recently approved an additional $500 million share repurchase authorization. This brings our total share repurchase authorization outstanding to $1.1 billion, giving us additional flexibility to deploy our capital and maximize shareholder value in a variety of ways. Now I'll turn to our outlook. Let me once again remind you that our earnings this quarter were impacted by 3 items that also affect our full year outlook. First, the $40 million pretax charge for a legal dispute in our Distribution Solutions segment had a negative impact of approximately $0.12 per diluted share for the quarter and for the full year. Second, the revenue deferrals and slower implementations in our international technology business and our Technology Solutions segment lowered our adjusted earnings by approximately $0.05 this quarter. Full year impact is expected to be about $0.09 per diluted share. Third, our full year expectation for our other businesses, primarily in Distribution Solutions, has improved by about $0.16 per diluted share, and essentially all of this increase will be seen in our March quarter. As a result of these 3 items, we are updating our guidance for the year on adjusted earnings from $7.15 to $7.35 to a new range of $7.10 to $7.30. The new range remains within our original guidance range of $7.05 to $7.35 that we issued at the beginning of this fiscal year, but we've now narrowed the top end of that range by $0.05. Turning back to the December quarter results for just a minute, I would say that relative to our expectations, our December quarter results also reflect a timing shift into our March quarter in 2 areas, both of which I've discussed: brand manufacturer economics and taxes. Now as John mentioned, when you think about fiscal 2014, you have a big drop off in new generic launches, which we've said for a long time represents a challenge for us. Of course, we run the company for the long term, and over the next several years, we are quite positive about generic launches. We are beginning our detailed planning process for the next fiscal year and working hard to make the right decisions in the coming months to position the company for the short-term challenges and the long-term opportunities. One final point about our fiscal 2013 outlook. In terms of guidance on our non-GAAP adjustments, I would remind you that our convention is to not include any forward impact from acquisitions on our guidance until the acquisitions have actually closed. With that in mind, we expect $0.55 per amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and due to the AWP litigation charges we recorded in the first half of the fiscal year, we are assuming $0.15 for litigation reserve adjustments. Also, including the impact, the $81 million pretax acquisition-related gain in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we expect acquisition expenses and related adjustments to add approximately $0.13. In summary, we've had 3 solid quarters and our view of the operating results of our primary businesses remains strong. Thanks, and with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I had a question, John, on the Med-Surg business. Clearly, 15% is really strong. Jeff talked about the extra day in the acquisitions being 4%, but 11% growth. Can you talk about where that's coming from? And how you see that business evolving? Was part of this flu and therefore more onetime-ish, or are you seeing a pickup in the overall business?
John H. Hammergren: I think we're seeing a pickup in the overall business, Lisa. I think we're doing a better job of penetrating our existing customer base from a sales perspective, selling more of what they need to run their practices. And clearly in the alternate site markets, we're growing rapidly in home care and extended care. I also would say that I think we are gaining some additional new customers as we progress with our value proposition in our offering. We're making our sales force more efficient through the productivity tools we're giving them so they have more time to spend with the customers, and we're providing tools to our customers, frankly, so they can order more efficiently from us. I would also say that the flu impact as we began to see it was more late in December. We might see some of it in our fourth quarter. I mean clearly, the January and February effects we'll see -- it won't really be that material on Med-Surg. But it's an important part of our business, and clearly we are seeing an uptake in physician office visits and emergency room visits, et cetera, in our industry. But I think overall, it's just kind of solid momentum across the board and almost all of the businesses that comprise Med-Surg and continued traction with the value proposition we've given to our customers.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then just as a follow-up, Jeff. But when we think about the technology and the deferred revenue, the $16 million and the $30 million, can you give us an idea of when that will ultimately be recognized?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, the reality as we sit here today, Lisa, is we have a situation where we've got a lot of bookings, a lot of implementations, a lot of customers who like the product, but a structure where that revenue is liable to be sitting on our balance sheet for an extended period of time. And so I can't give you a solid end point sitting here today. I would tell you that as we think about our FY '14 plans, that revenue is unlikely to reverse in FY '14 even. And so the magnitude of the challenge I just described in '13 is liable to be somewhat replicated in FY '14.
John H. Hammergren: Yes, I will also just add to Jeff's comments here, I think we're excited about the progress the team is making in getting customers on board with our value proposition. But in the near term, with that revenue rec issue being out in front of us, we actually probably are booking more expenses in the near term and it can't be delayed, and the revenue gets delayed as we get these implementations done and continue to build up the value of the product for our customers. So it actually has a compounding effect. The success of the bookings raises expenses, and the revenue gets delayed as we try to get it. Now we are getting the cash though, and so I think there's an indication that products are working and our customers are happy. It really is just an issue of making sure that we've met the obligations and the requirements our customers have in front of us before we can actually book the revenue.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Just to be very clear on the accounting, Lisa and John. So all of the expenses associated with these customers, we just book ratably as we incur it. That's why I made the comment earlier that I described the revenue that's being deferred is really revenue that...
John H. Hammergren: It's almost...
Jeffrey C. Campbell: We would have, and when it hits the P&L, will be almost 100% earnings.
John H. Hammergren: Right.
Operator: And we'll go next to Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: I guess just on the drug business or actually the Distribution business, obviously Med-Surg did a little bit better. On the drug side, you mentioned maybe branded price inflation or benefits from branded price have gone up a little bit. But can you give us some more understanding of what's driving a pretty big upside, I guess, in the distribution business overall versus what your expectations were?
John H. Hammergren: I think that it's really across the board, Tom. I think the branded guys -- or excuse me, the distribution guys are really performing very well. They're focused in executing well across the board. As Jeff mentioned, we do see continued strength in our relationships with the branded manufacturers. Frankly, most of that strength will be realized in our fourth quarter as we've seen the progression of what's transpired early in this calendar year. So I think we are feeling good about what's going on. Our Canadian business, setting aside the charge, is performing well. And I think our generic business is executed very well as well. So -- and I think that we've -- we're in pretty good shape in that business and are executing well.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: I guess just as a follow-up. Any color you can offer within the specialty business, whether it be sort of the traditional side or the US Oncology side?
John H. Hammergren: I think we're actually having strength across the board also in specialty. I think we've seen a nice ramp in customers who have either already joined or indicated an interest in joining our US Oncology Network, which, as you know, is the most intimate of the relationships we have with our customers in that space. Our value proposition there is quite expansive, and as customers come under pressure, clearly US Oncology is an alternative that I think most folks are considering. One of the things we're tracking a lot now is what benefit are our customers realizing by being part of the US Oncology Network and is that benefit improving year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. And I can tell you, we're tracking very nicely for our customers as it relates to their performance under these programs with us. So that's a real positive. And I do think that the segment overall continues to be poised for a good growth as we look forward.
Operator: And we'll go next to Steven Valiquette with UBS.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Just at the end of the prepared comments, you guys -- you mentioned something along the lines of working hard to make the right decisions regarding short-term challenges in fiscal '14. And I guess, are you generally referring to potential uses of balance sheet capacity when you say that, or are there other things you're referring to with that comment? Just trying to get more color on that.
John H. Hammergren: Yes, I think we look at our opportunities in fiscal '14, both from a headwind and a tailwind perspective, et cetera, how are we going to position for an environment where generics are going to grow slower than they have historically. Now I think everybody understands it's going to be difficult for us to fill the gap year-on-year on the performance related to what drove -- what was driven by generics. But from time to time, not unlike any company of our size, we have to review ways in which we might become even more efficient and be more effective as an organization. We have a very strong culture of Six Sigma and continuous improvement in our business, and we're always thinking about things that we can do to optimize our facilities or consolidate various systems to get the potential outcome -- best potential outcome we can for our company. There's always trade-offs in making these decisions, and we have to be careful about the kinds of things we might consider. But clearly, we want to be lean and mean, and we want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to optimize our performance in '14. But the most important thing for us to do in '14 is not to impact negatively our trajectory going into '15, because we see this hiatus of generics in the next year as not something that's a permanent reset in the way our business operates but a temporary year-on-year comparison that we'll get through, and then as we get into the next year, we're going to be poised once again to experience the type of growth that we have historically. So that's really what we're looking at, and I think we want to be as efficient as we can be.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: The other thing I might remind you of, Steve, is as we always point out when we first provide guidance for the year, when we're providing guidance, we always exclude any potential future material litigation reserve adjustments or acquisitions divestitures or material charges that we take because of any restructuring decisions we might make.
Operator: And we'll go next to Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Actually, I think everybody's thinking along the same lines, most of my questions have been asked. But I'm just curious if you could give a little more detail, Jeff, on your comments on the corporate expense being up $27 million in the quarter. Was there anything specific to call out realizing the full year is somewhat normal? And then this may be difficult, but as a follow-up, just with the Canadian legal settlement, do you believe with the $40 million you've taken to full magnitude of the potential outcome or could there be additional charges taken that would be material enough to call out in the future?
John H. Hammergren: Well, let me maybe do those in reverse order. On the Canadian charge, we clearly think the $40 million is the right reserve because that's what we booked. I would emphasize that those are discussions that are at a very advanced stage, so nothing is over until it's over. But I would say, Eric, that gives us a pretty high level of confidence that we have the right number and that's the end of it. On corporate expenses, you are right. They vary a lot quarter-to-quarter. I suppose one of the realities of being a company founded in 1833 is sometimes we have history. So last year, we had an old -- a little bit of an asset impairment in that line. This year, you have things like a environmental charge we took that relates to the chemical business we were once in, and it's a pretty sizable charge. So over the course of a year, all those things tend to kind of net out. And that's why I feel pretty good when I look at that corporate expense line and what we're projecting for the full year, and it's pretty flattish. This year, just because of the timing of the way things happened in last year's December quarter versus this year's December quarter, with the example I just gave you of environmental -- significant environmental charge, it looks tough year-over-year. But I don't think there's anything that you need to think about or model in from a run rate perspective.
Operator: And we'll go next to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Jeff, I just want to follow up on the healthcare IT guidance for this fiscal year. It sounds like you're expecting the margin there to be slightly below the long-term target of mid-teens. I just want to make sure I understood that correctly as you referred back to last year's fiscal operating profit number. And then looking out longer term, any reason to think that, that mid-teens goal is not -- still intact beyond to this fiscal year?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: No, it would work backwards. Certainly, our goal has not changed at all, and it's obviously frustrating and disappointing to us that a change in how we view what's going on in the -- that international technology business in terms of the rev rec is going to keep us from getting to it for the year. To be clear, for the year, yes. If you go back and you look at the operating margin last year, our guidance is we should -- you should see revenue growth off last year's revenue similar to the kind of growth we had last year, which was 4%. And the operating margin will be pretty flat to last year, so that gives you a pretty tight band in which you can think about the operating profit of that segment.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Great. And then just if I could follow up on the new authorization, I think that brings the total buyback now to over $1 billion. I wasn't sure how much buyback would play into fiscal fourth quarter or to next year given the proposed acquisition. I guess is there any message or direction you'd care to give us around the potential buyback as we think about next fiscal year?
John H. Hammergren: Well, we never like to tell people exactly when we're going to be buying stock back and when we're not. I think there's a couple of important messages here. One is that we continue to have -- be in great cash businesses, and we have a very strong balance sheet. So even with the upcoming $2.1 billion acquisition of PSS, we're confident that you will see some level of continued share repurchase, albeit obviously lower than it would have been if we weren't buying PSS. And I think the incremental authorization that the board gave us this week is a sign of all of our confidence in the future and where we're going as a company.
Operator: We'll go next to George Hill with Citi.
George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just number -- first, Jeff, I know that you're loath to talk about fiscal '14, but is there any chance you'd give us directionally some quantification of the headwind with the contribution of generic conversions in fiscal '13 versus the headwind that you'll face in fiscal '14?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: George, we have not taken a cut at it because one thing we certainly learned is that the world of generic launches changes every week. And that's why when we give you guidance in late April or early May, we'll be very precise on what we're assuming. When we go to make those assumptions, I make the observation that we're using the same data that is available to everyone publicly. And so I've seen several people take estimates at this, and it's a big number. And the estimates range just like our own estimates range, but it's a big number. But I don't want to -- if I gave you a number today, I'm sure I'd have to give you a different number in 3 months because the world will change.
John H. Hammergren: No, I think it's also fair to say, George, that generic is but one component of our overall performance, and we're doing everything we can to make sure that we've -- we're piling up more tailwinds than we have headwinds. Now, it's always an ongoing battle, and we're not finished with our planning for next year. But I think that's why Jeff is a little reluctant to say, well, here's the challenge generics might be. First of all, we don't necessarily know the full number yet because our teams are still working on what their projections are going to be. And secondly, hopefully, there'll be other things that are going in our favor that will help minimize that effect to the extent that we can.
George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Fair enough. And then maybe, John, just a quick strategic follow-up. I want to follow on Steve's question. It sounds like what you're telling us strategically regarding fiscal '14 is that while generics are a tough comp, expense ratio versus profit levels might seem a little higher in fiscal '14. But you guys want to stay at a strategic level given the long-term profile or the growth profile of the business, I guess, am I thinking about that right? It sounds like you're telling us you don't want to be in a position of having to cut expenses given the opportunity despite the challenges in '14.
John H. Hammergren: Right. I think the way you should interpret what I said was that like anybody else, we have an opportunity to look at where you can tighten the belt and what steps you can make and the rock you haven't lifted in a couple of years might be lifted and provided an opportunity. And I think what we're saying is that in the next several months, we are going to be focused on how do we provide more momentum going into FY '14, to some of the measures we can control, things we can do, and it could be our sourcing activities, even our indirect sourcing activities and things like copy paper, how do we refine what we do to reduce our spending as much as we can. But the real message I was leaving you was we're not going to do anything to the company in fiscal '14 because I mean structurally, like shutting down 1/2 our distribution centers, et cetera, because we believe our growth trajectory is going to come back as we look at fiscal '15 and beyond. And so this is not an issue of an industry reset where the distribution business is going to lose significant volumes and therefore we have to restructure our cost. I think this is an opportunity for us to just be responsible and be reflective and make sure that we're positioning the company properly as we come back into what we think will be more promising years ahead.
Operator: And we'll go next to Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Jeff and John, you've mentioned some deal-related costs for transactions that had closed this year as contributing to the cost in the third quarter. Any indication how quickly those will drop off?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, we gather, Bob, in our acquisition-related expense line anything that is directly related to either the transaction costs, so something large like PSS when we get there. It will be things like the cost of doing the bridge loan, et cetera. We also put in there integration costs, restructuring costs as you go about consolidating facilities, et cetera. So when we -- what is a little confusing about that line, however, this year is we have this unusual accounting earlier in the year where we have a very large gain related to buying the other 50% of our headquarters building we didn't previously own. If you strip that out, it looks like a more normal number. So as the other thing, just to be very clear, is what's -- what we've got in there in the 9 months year-to-date is obviously anything that has been incurred related to a transaction that we have announced. So, for example, there's a little bit of PSS cost in the year-to-date, about $6 million and the -- related to PSS because we incurred those costs subsequent to announcing it. But as I give you guidance for the March quarter on those numbers, we haven't closed PSS, so I'm not including in those estimates, all of the costs that we will in fact incur at the time we close PSS because it would still be an estimate. So, boy, if I -- listening to myself, I know I made this very, very confusing.
John H. Hammergren: I think one of the positives about providing adjusted earnings is that we take some of that complexity out. And so when Jeff spent the last portion of his prepared remarks talking about these items, I believe all of those items are actually adjusted out. And so that was meant to help you reconcile between adjusted and GAAP as opposed to some flavor on onetime issues in the quarter that were adjusted -- the one, our -- the Canadian issue and those other issues flowed through earnings and were not adjusted. And when we talk about litigation-related expenses, for example, they're related to very specific litigation items, of which primarily AWP, maybe all AWP and this RAMQ thing, for example, doesn't get adjusted out. So we've ...
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Just in operating [indiscernible]...
John H. Hammergren: We've tried to be pretty specific about what we put in and what we put out, and that was a bit of a reconciliation.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I will follow up on that. Is it possible that you could just give us any kind of clue as to how PSS World did in the quarter. I doubt we are going to see those results ever. Will we?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, you probably will see their results because as an SEC registrant who's independent, and we obviously can't speak for PSS because we don't own them today, they have an SEC filing requirement and they will be filing their Q in early February in line with their filing obligations. And I would estimate that we'll be closing around the end of February.
Operator: And I'll go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Jeff, in the prepared remarks, I think you mentioned that you've seen a shift from warehouse to direct sales in the quarter. Can you talk about what's driving this change? Is this is a specific client or is this something that you're seeing -- a change that you're seeing in the marketplace? And do you expect it also to continue into your -- the March quarter?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: We only have a few customers in our warehouse line. And the warehouse line has been partially negatively affected by the move to generics. When a brand moves to generic, many of these customers will -- first of all, it goes down in price. Secondly, it may be sourced on a direct basis where otherwise, it might have been a warehouse item. But the phenomena moving to direct clearly is a separate issue, and I think our customers see tremendous value in the service we provide in a direct model. And so several of our customers have said I know we used the warehouse and that sells -- shifts into our warehouses, we prefer to have you manage this directly to our store so we don't have to go through the supply chain expense of handling it ourselves. So there's lots of reasons people would pick to do that. But generally speaking, I think our customers see value in going on a direct model with us.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So should I think about it as partially a revenue mix? Because to your point, some of the warehouse revenues are coming out of the system because the brand goes to generic and partly also in incremental dollar growth in direct-store sales, assuming our associate with higher margins around customers to see that value, basically 2 separate drivers?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Yes. So -- and then to be clear, Ricky, this is really relative to our expectations for the year. The very good news to John's point is while we knew warehouse revenues were going to have a significant downward hit from the brand-to-generic conversions because it's all brand product, we have seen more of an offset than we expected as the handful -- less than a handful really of customers that John was talking about have chosen to put a little bit more through the direct channel than the warehouse channel. It's a very good thing for us.
Operator: And we'll go next to Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Jeff, maybe if I can just also go back to some of the items that you said at the end of your prepared comments as we think about, I guess, the rest of fiscal '13. I got most of it here. You talked obviously about the $0.12 for Canada, the, I guess, $0.05 for the deferred rev, $0.04 in the fourth quarter. And then you mentioned this $0.16 benefit from the other businesses. I think I missed part of your comments, if you could just kind of explain that again.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Yes, Charles, I'm happy to reprise the math because it is a little -- our results are not as simple as we might have hoped this quarter. But the charge in Canada equates to $0.12. And then the full year impact relative to our expectations of the revenue deferrals in our international business is $0.09. So that would -- if there were nothing else going on, you'd think we would take our guidance range down by the $0.21. The very good news is we're feeling much more positive about the full year results across really all of our other businesses, although it is primarily distribution. And that's about $0.16 of upsides. And that's why if you look at what do we do with our guidance range versus 90 days ago, we've only moved it down $0.05, despite the challenge of the $0.12 of the charge in Canada.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: I got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then part of that $0.16, is it fair to think that it's also part of the brand economics or is that sort of a separate issue then?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: That would certainly be one driver.
Operator: And we'll go next to David Larsen with Leerink Swann.
David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: Could you guys talk a little bit more about the -- you said there was a better-than-expected uptick in the Paragon conversions. Is there any way you can sort of size sort of how many McKesson Horizon hospitals have converted so far or sort of what gives you comfort in that statement?
John H. Hammergren: Well, I guess, we typically don't talk about customer accounts by products and in certain markets who's buying what. I guess the comment or the discussion was meant to provide some confidence with our stakeholders that the Paragon product line is being well received. And that many of our customers that had been using the Horizon product line that have been faced with a serious question about the consideration of Paragon versus the consideration of other alternatives that more than we had expected are actually committing to Paragon and moving forward with that decision. We've also made tremendous progress with Horizon. Our customers are stable, our implementations have gone well, people are getting to Meaningful Use attestation, and our products are coming GA at the time frame that we had expected. And our Paragon roadmap is solid and remains on track as well. Our emergency department product is now GA-ed or getting close to GA-ing. Our reviews with the firms that have been helping us to make sure that we're on track on the development perspective are pleased. And as I mentioned in my comments, class has now rated the product for the seventh year in a row Best in Class for Community Healthcare. But I think surprisingly -- surprising to some, not to us, but to some, the product is now rated basically #2 in the marketplace overall because of its ease of use, its integration and its cost of ownership. So we're really pleased with the customer satisfaction really across the board, even when you think about the larger hospitals that are moving from Horizon to Paragon. It's going quite well.
David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: That's great. Will Horizon bring hospitals through Stage 2 and 3 of Meaningful Use?
John H. Hammergren: Yes, we're committed to making our customers successful. I don't want to get too specific about the specific individual customers. But clearly, Meaningful Use is important to us. And we want these customers to get there, and we'll help them get there on Horizon and on Paragon.
Operator: And we'll go next to Glen Santangelo with Crédit Suisse.
Glen J. Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: John and Jeff, if I listen to what you're saying about the fourth quarter, by my math, it kind of feels like you need over an 80-basis-point sequential improvement in your op margin and Distribution Solutions to kind of get to the midpoint of your range. And I understand there's some noise in the 3Q number. But given that you told us over the years that you're not as dependent on price inflation and, John, I think you called out some branded manufacture economics, is it all coming on the branded side? And what's really driving it? Is it the price inflation in 1Q? Like what drives such a huge sequential increase like that?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, let me just remind you, Glen, of one thing, which is while there is only a modest piece of our annual economics with brand manufacturers that is price dependent, even for the portion where we know what we're going to make in a year, the timing of which quarter we get it can still be completely driven by price increases. And so what we clearly saw this year as they shipped out of the December quarter and into the March quarter, so I mean your -- I haven't done the math maybe exactly the way you did, but we're quite confident in the guidance we've given. If it checks out with the math you've done, yes, we will have a very unusually strong March quarter driven by all parts of our business. But the timing of those brand economics will be a significant piece of it.
Glen J. Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then maybe if I could just follow up, Jeff. In the press release, in one of the footnotes, you said that in the third quarter and first 9 months, you recorded a product alignment charge in the Tech Solutions business of $42 million. And I went back to the past releases and never saw this charge before. And I'm wondering when did you record these charges?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: That was -- actually that was last December quarter when we -- a year ago when we made the decision to make Paragon the key...
Glen J. Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Oh, I get it, okay. So that's all part of that. There's nothing in this quarter.
Operator: And we'll take our final question from Ross Muken with ISI Group.
Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: So just quickly on the PSS financing and sort of where we are, can you just remind us when you gave sort of your initial assumptions around the transaction, what your assumptions were around financing? It feels like it might be more cash now. And so I'm just trying to figure out sort of what's changed in that mix versus when it was originally reported.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Yes, I may have confused people, Ross. We really have not previously given any assumptions about financing. To help people just with the math, what I said when we first announced it was, look, if you're thinking about what kind of earnings will it generate in the first 12 months, if you were to assume we 100% financed it at 4% debt, you would have $0.15 to $0.25 of accretion. I didn't mean to imply we were going to 100% finance it. It was just a way to help people be very clear on the math. Accretion's kind of a funny number when you think about it in isolation for a transaction of this size because, of course, we would have done something else with the cash if we hadn't bought -- if we weren't buying PSS. So I'd caution people about being purely incremental on the accretion related to this.
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
John H. Hammergren: Excellent. Thank you very much, Amber, and thank you also for joining us on the call today. I'm very pleased with our operating performance in Distribution Solutions, including the strong momentum in our Medical-Surgical business, as we move closer to completing our acquisition of PSS World Medical. I continue to believe we are well positioned to deliver value to our customers by helping them improve their business health and their ability to connect with other stakeholders and ultimately deliver better care to their patients. And like always, I want to thank our McKesson associates for their hard work and focus on our customers' success. I now will hand the call over to Erin for a review of our upcoming events for the financial community.
Erin Lampert: Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events. On February 13, we will present at the Leerink Swann Global Healthcare Conference in New York, and on May 15, we will present at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Health Care Conference in Las Vegas. We will release fourth quarter earnings results in early May. We look forward to seeing you at an upcoming event. Thank you and goodbye.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the McKesson Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Erin Lampert: Thank you, Jim. Good morning, and welcome to the McKesson's Fiscal 2013 Second Quarter Earnings Call. With me today are John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and Jeff Campbell, our CFO. John will first provide a business update, and we'll then introduce Jeff, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After Jeff's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after 1 hour at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Before we begin, I'll remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press releases for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results acquisition expenses and related adjustments, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and certain litigation reserve adjustments. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for our investors. Please refer to our press release announcing second quarter fiscal 2013 results available on our website for a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thanks, and here is John Hammergren.
John H. Hammergren: Thank you, Erin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on our call. This morning, McKesson announced our agreement to acquire PSS World Medical for a total consideration of approximately $2.1 billion. The close of the transaction is subject to customary conditions, including all necessary regulatory clearances and the approval of the PSS shareholders. McKesson's Medical-Surgical business and PSS will combine to form a leading provider of medical supplies and services and technology. We're very excited about this transaction and the value it will bring to our customers, our supply chain partners, the employees of both organizations and to our shareholders. Before I walk through our thoughts on the strategy of the combined organization, let me review the primary financial impacts of the transaction, and Jeff will also provide more information in his remarks. Under the terms of the agreement, McKesson is acquiring all of the outstanding shares of PSS World Medical for $29 in cash. In total, including PSS World Medical's existing debt of about $480 million and related transaction costs, the transaction is valued at approximately $2.1 billion. The value and synergy in this transaction will happen over time. By the fourth year, we expect to realize annual pretax synergies in excess of $100 million. This transaction underscores McKesson's deep commitment to its physician and extended care customers. Industry participants will play an increasingly important role as the implementation of health care reform continues and demographic shifts increased demand. By preserving the strengths of both businesses, the combined organization will bring extensive distribution capabilities, deep product and technology expertise and a broad portfolio of business services to the industry. The combined organization will benefit from the addition of PSS World Medical's distribution network, private fleet, broad laboratory customer base and strong private-label offerings, which will complement McKesson's broad portfolio of solutions to maximize value for our customers. Upon the close of the transaction, the 2 management teams have come together under the combined leadership of Stanton McComb, President of McKesson Medical-Surgical business; and Gary Corless, President and Chief Executive Officer of PSS. The combined business will report to Paul Julian, Executive Vice President and Group President of McKesson. Stanton and Gary are both exceptional leaders who are passionate about their teams and the opportunity to enhance the value we deliver to our customers. In summary, we have a great track record of deploying capital wisely, and we are very excited about the opportunity to bring together these 2 great organizations. Turning now to McKesson's results for the second quarter. Today we reported another solid quarter with total company revenues of $29.9 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.92. Based on our performance year-to-date, we are updating our previous outlook for the fiscal year and now expect to achieve adjusted earnings per diluted share of $7.15 to $7.35 for fiscal 2013. Before I turn the call over to Jeff for a detailed review of our financial results, I will provide some highlights from both of our segments of our business. Distribution Solutions had strong operating profit growth on revenue that was down 1% compared to the prior year. As you know, our fiscal 2013 is a robust year for oral generic launches, and in particular, our second quarter saw a number of sizable launches which had a deflationary impact on our revenue line. As a result, adjusted operating profit grew by 10%, driven by strong execution across the segment. So overall, I'm pleased with the financial performance of the Distribution Solutions segment in the first half of the fiscal year, and I remain confident in our full year expectations. Turning now to our U.S. Pharmaceutical distribution business. I want to highlight a couple of important accomplishments. First, I know there's been a fair amount of discussion about the overall competitive environment, perhaps driven by a few very public contract awards in our industry in the current year. We are proud to have long-standing customer relationships, and that the core of McKesson's values as a company is to deliver outstanding service, products, technology and innovation so that we have the opportunity to create customers for life. As a matter of what we consider to be good business practice, we don't make a habit of talking about our customers or our competitors' customers publicly. We believe our customers value the confidential nature of our business relationship. One of the few relationships that is more public than others due to our customers' disclosure requirements, is our relationship with Rite Aid. McKesson has enjoyed a long-standing relationship with Rite Aid, and we're very pleased to have recently extended our distribution agreement through March of 2016. Turning to another important part of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. For the third time in 4 years, McKesson's Health Mart franchise achieved the highest ranking in overall customer satisfaction among chain drugstore pharmacies in the J.D. Power and Associates 2012 U.S. National Pharmacy Study. The study encompassed responses from more than 12,700 consumers surveyed on overall customer satisfaction. Our Health Mart pharmacists delivered outstanding personalized care to their patients every day, and we're proud that their dedication has been acknowledged. This recognition from consumers further reinforces the value patients receive from Health Mart pharmacies and also demonstrates the value of the partnership between Health Mart and community pharmacies. We're also extremely pleased to reach the milestone of 3,000 Health Mart stores during our second quarter. And finally, in the second quarter, we named Mark Walchirk as the new President of our U.S. Pharmaceutical distribution business. Mark has held numerous roles inside of McKesson over the past 11 years, including Chief Operating Officer of McKesson Specialty Health and Chief Operating Officer of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. Mark succeeds Brian Tyler, who is appointed Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Business Development in August, following Marc Owens' appointment as President of McKesson Specialty Health. These executive appointments demonstrate the deep bench strength of leadership talent within McKesson, and I believe we have the best business leaders in the industry. In the specialty market, we continue to strengthen our position. I've been pleased to see our teams' ability to win new customers and expand our value to existing customers in this market through a combination of great service and great technology. We also continued to add physicians to our US Oncology network and grow and expand our innovative partnerships with hospitals throughout the country. In our Canadian Distribution business, we delivered solid operating performance across our many lines of business in the second quarter, and I'm pleased to see the steady progress our team continues to make in Canada. And the acquisition of the Katz's banner business is performing extremely well. We've not only succeeded in working closely with the acquired banner members to strengthen their business but we've also seen benefits across our existing banner network from the expanded scale we acquired with the Katz acquisition. Through acquisitions like the Katz Group, as well as the solid execution and innovation of our team in Canada, we continue to find ways to mitigate the impact of government-imposed price reductions on generic drugs. Turning to our Medical-Surgical business, we continue to benefit from organic growth as well as our ability to gain new customers. Revenues were flat for the quarter, but this was mainly due to there being 5 fewer days of sales in the quarter. Adjusting for the difference in sales days, revenues increased approximately 8% in the quarter. We've had terrific momentum and strong results in our Medical-Surgical business for some time. With the acquisition of PSS World Medical, we will leverage the best of both organizations including the unified strength of the most knowledgeable and tenured sales teams in the industry. The combination of great products, services, technology and people will be the platform to continue this momentum and enhance the value we will bring to our customers. In summary, I'm pleased with the solid performance of our Distribution Solutions segment. We are excited about the opportunities in front of us and confident in our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. Turning now to Technology Solutions. Our first half results have been modestly better than we had planned, primarily due to timing. But our full year expectations remain unchanged. For the second quarter, revenues were flat and adjusted operating margins were 13.83%. We continue to make progress in ensuring our customers' success and supporting them on their journey to reaching important Meaningful Use milestones as they move forward with creating more connected and accountable health care communities. We start with a portfolio that is unmatched in breadth, which gives McKesson a unique view in the flow of information between patients, providers, hospitals and pharmacies as it takes place today and what will be necessary for the future. As our customers' needs evolve, we will invest internally and externally in the critical technologies that will help them succeed. In the second quarter, we announced 2 acquisitions, and although they are not expected to have material impact on earnings in the near-term, they are important to our strategy going forward. At the end of September, we announced our acquisition of MedVentive which will become part of our provider technology business. MedVentive's products and solutions will work together to enable providers to proactively manage the clinical health of at-risk patient populations by identifying gaps in care and delivering actionable information to care providers. These capabilities are important to the accountable care and patient-centered medical home offerings across our Technology Solutions segment. In early October, we announced our plans to acquire Med3000 which further strengthens our core offering in revenue management solutions. Just to remind people, who might not be as familiar with our revenue management solutions business, this business offers leading outsourced financial and billing solutions primarily to physician practices and hospitals. These solutions are more important than ever as physicians, hospitals and other entities work to reduce costs and run their businesses more effectively. Turning to McKesson Health Solutions. We've been investing and creating more connected solutions for our customers, and one recent example is McKesson Reimbursement Manager. This solution has the ability to manage multiple reimbursement models by identifying the correct provider reimbursement rate based on the unique combination of several provider- and client-specific attributes. This capability is important to payers and providers as they navigate the complex reimbursement models that are becoming more common in the marketplace. And finally, turning to RelayHealth, which is a key length in bringing together many of our solutions for our customers, you've heard us talk about the pharmacy and hospital network business and we have -- also have been growing the business in the management of clinical information. Our ability to connect health care information in a secure way helped us position for win the recent TRICARE award for secure messaging throughout the entire military health system, and for the Air Force award for automatically populating patient health records with actionable information from the Air Force's data repository. In summary, we report another solid quarter of operating performance, and I'm pleased to use the tremendous strength of our balance sheet to bring together 2 great organizations, our Medical-Surgical business and PSS World Medical. And we still have the financial flexibility to continue our portfolio approach to capital deployment to create value for our shareholders. I'm proud of our accomplishments and excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, and return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results reflect a solid performance at this halfway point in our fiscal year. We're obviously pleased that the strength of our balance sheet has allowed us this morning to announce our transaction with PSS. And I'll offer a few financial comments on PSS at the end of my remarks. My comments today on our earnings will focus on our $1.92 adjusted earnings per share, which as you recall, excludes 3 types of items, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments and certain litigation reserve adjustments. The numbers I'll review in my discussion today will be based on an adjusted earnings basis and can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 included in today's press release. Let me first turn to our consolidated results for the quarter which can be found on Schedule 2A. Consolidated revenues were $29.9 billion for the quarter, down 1% from the prior year. There are a number of factors behind this 1% decline, and I'll cover these as I discuss each of the segments in more detail. On this small decline in revenues, our adjusted gross profit was up 4% for the quarter. I'd remind you that this quarter reflects a record number of recent generic launches which had a deflationary impact on revenues while driving up our adjusted gross profit. Total adjusted operating expenses were up just 2% to $1 billion for the quarter as we showed good expense management across the company. Moving down the P&L. Other income was up $4 million for the quarter to $10 million and interest expense declined 14% to $55 million for the quarter. As you recall, we repaid $400 million in long-term debt in February of fiscal 2012, and we now have another $500 million maturity due in March of fiscal 2013. Looking ahead, we expect to refinance both amounts later this fiscal year. As a result, we would expect our interest expense to increase modestly in the back half of fiscal 2013. I would point out that this is just a refinancing of existing debt and is independent of the PSS transaction, the financing for which I will come back to at the end of my remarks. Turning now to taxes. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter of approximately 30% benefited from $7 million of net favorable discrete tax items. Similar to the first quarter, some of these favorable tax discrete items came in earlier in the fiscal year than we had originally anticipated. Also, for the full year, we now expect a higher total of net favorable discrete tax items. As a result of these changes, we've lowered our full year estimate of the adjusted tax rate a bit from 31% to 30.5%. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $461 million, up 13% from the prior year. Our adjusted earnings per share was $1.92, an increase of 18%, compared to last year's adjusted EPS of $1.63. And wrapping up our consolidated results, this year's earnings per share number was aided by the cumulative impact of our share repurchases which lowered our diluted weighted average shares outstanding by 4% year-over-year to 240 million. We continue to expect our full year average diluted shares to come in around our original guidance assumption of 239 million shares outstanding. Before moving on to our segment results, let me comment on one other item, which while not impacting our adjusted earnings, did impact our GAAP results this quarter, specifically the $44 million AWP litigation charge. As a reminder, last quarter, we reached a final agreement with the coalition of State Attorneys General to resolve the majority of state medicaid claims related to AWP. Since then, we have continued to work through the remaining state Medicaid cases. As a result of progress made towards resolving these remaining state Medicaid cases, we have increased the AWP litigation reserve by $44 million. This charge has been recorded in the Distribution Solutions segment, and it equates to $0.11 per diluted share. Let's now move on to our segment adjusted earnings results which can be found on Schedule 3A. In Distribution Solutions, total revenues were down 1% for the quarter versus the prior year. Direct distribution and services revenues were also down 1% for the quarter to $20.9 billion. This is roughly in line with our original expectations as we continue to expect direct revenues to be fairly flat for the full fiscal year due to the record number of generic launches in fiscal 2013. Our warehouse revenues decreased 2% year-over-year. The primary driver of this decline was brand-to-generic conversions which particularly impact our warehouse revenues. Relative to our original expectation of unusually strong growth in our warehouse revenues this year, we now expect warehouse revenues to be fairly flat for the full year. As you know, we earn lower margins on our warehouse revenues relative to the margins on our direct revenues. Therefore, the impact on earnings from lower warehouse revenue is quite modest. Canadian revenues, on a reported basis, declined 5% for the quarter primarily due to an unfavorable currency impact and there being 1 less sales day in the quarter. Factoring out both of these items, Canadian revenues declined just 1% for the quarter. And as John mentioned earlier, our team in Canada continues to do a good job of mitigating the impact of government-imposed price reductions on generic drugs. Moving on to Medical-Surgical. While reported revenues were flat for the quarter at $873 million, results were impacted by there being 5 fewer sales days in the quarter this year. Excluding the impact of having 5 fewer sales days, Medical-Surgical revenues grew a healthy 8% for the quarter driven by market growth and new customers. We are pleased to see continued steady growth in our Medical-Surgical business and believe we are well positioned to carry this momentum forward. Distribution Solutions' adjusted gross profit increased 6% for the quarter to $1.3 billion. This represents an adjusted gross margin improvement of 34 basis points versus the prior year. There were a number of components driving these results. We did, of course, have tremendous growth in oral generic profits this quarter. The quarter also benefited from 2 timing items that particularly aided our results. First, we received $19 million of favorable antitrust settlements in the quarter which added roughly $0.05 to $0.06 to our adjusted earnings this quarter. We do plan, over the course of the year, for some level of these types of settlements, but the timing and precise amount always varies. Second, we also saw a timing shift this quarter with our manufacturer economics. When you think about our relationships with manufacturers, the majority of our compensation is fixed over the course of a full year. However, the timing of when we recognize that compensation can be impacted by price increases and other factors, some of which were particularly strong this quarter. Adjusted operating expense in the segment was up just 3% for the quarter primarily driven by the costs associated with acquiring the Katz assets. Given this, we were pleased overall with the expense management in this segment. The adjusted operating margin rate for this segment was 241 basis points this quarter, an increase of 25 basis points versus the prior year. As you've heard me say many times before, given the quarterly variability in this segment, we always focus on full year margins. Based on our first half fiscal 2013 results, we now expect adjusted operating margin improvement in the high single-digit basis points compared to our full year fiscal 2012 adjusted operating margin rate of 210 basis points. In summary, we're pleased with the first half performance in our Distribution Solutions segment. Moving now to Technology Solutions. Total revenues were flat for the quarter at $824 million and adjusted gross profit declined 3% to $384 million. Technology Solutions' gross R&D spending was $116 million, roughly flat with last year's $115 million. The capitalization rate was unchanged at 9%. Adjusted operating expense increased by just 1% in the quarter to $272 million, and we are pleased with the team's ability to control expense growth. Technology Solutions' adjusted operating profit was down 10% versus 1 year ago to $114 million and our adjusted operating margin was 13.83% compared to 15.27% 1 year ago. For the full year, we continue to expect our adjusted operating margin to be in the low end of our long-term Technology Solutions adjusted operating margin goal range of mid-teens or 14% to 16%. Leaving our segment performance now and turning briefly to the balance sheet and our working capital metrics. Our receivables were $9.8 billion, up from the prior year balance of $9.5 billion and our day sales outstanding increased by 1 day to 26 days. Compared to 1 year ago, inventories increased 7% to $10.1 billion and payables were up 4% to $15.5 billion. This resulted in our day sales in inventory increasing by 2 days to 32 days, and our day sales and payables increasing by 3 days to 50 days. These working capital metrics resulted in McKesson generating $459 million in operating cash flow year-to-date. For the full year, we continue to expect our cash flows from operations will be between $2 billion and $2.5 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.8 billion. And of this amount, approximately $1.6 billion was offshore. Overall, our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 31.7% for the quarter, at the low end of our target range of 30% to 40%. Capitalized spending was $167 million for the first 6 months of the year, and we continue to expect full year internal capital spending between $425 million and $475 million. Now I will turn to our outlook. Given the solid first half results, we are updating our guidance on adjusted earnings from $7.05 to $7.35 to a new range of $7.15 to $7.35. In addition, we now expect $0.54 for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. And due to the AWP litigation charge we recorded this quarter, we are now assuming $0.15 for litigation reserve adjustments. Also to remind you, as a result of the $81 million pretax acquisition-related gain we had in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we expect acquisition expenses and related adjustments to add approximately $0.18. Now let me take a few moments to talk about the financial aspects of the PSS transaction that we announced today. As in all our acquisitions, this acquisition had to make both great strategic sense and great financial sense. As you've heard me say before, we look at many financial metrics when evaluating acquisition opportunities. We believe PSS will provide a great return on capital for our shareholders, create value we can only get by combining the 2 companies and reasonably share that value creation between the 2 companies' shareholders. For now, we have chosen to not include any impact from this transaction in our fiscal 2013 guidance, which I just took you through, since we cannot predict the precise timings of the close. To help you think about the P&L impact, however, if you were to simply assume that the transaction was 100% debt-financed at a 4% interest rates, we would expect the acquisition to be $0.15 to $0.25 accretive in the first 12 months after closing on an adjusted earnings basis. For those of you who track us on a GAAP basis, our initial estimate for intangible amortization is roughly $100 million per year. Longer term, as John stated earlier, our synergies in this business case of over $100 million per year will be realized incrementally over the first 4 years as we integrate the companies. To be clear, our intention on permanent financing will be to use a mixture of cash on hand and new debt. Initially, we will be putting in place a bridge facility to help fund the close of the transaction. The precise amount of new permanent debt, we then issue after the transaction closes, will vary depending upon circumstances at that time. To make another probably obvious point, probably the transaction of this size, given our portfolio approach to capital deployment, we are likely to do a little less share repurchases than we otherwise would've done in the near-term. And finally, once the transaction is closed, we will be reporting the results of PSS as part of our Distribution Solutions segment. Thanks and with that, I'm going to turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Steven Valiquette from UBS.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So basically my question is -- my understanding is the companies have slightly different distribution models when you look at McKesson versus PSSI, where one is kind of using a third-party carrier. The other one's using may be a fleet of vans for a lot of the physical delivery. So I'm just trying to get a sense whether you thought about the go-forward strategy and the physical distribution. Is that also a major part of the cost synergies of the deal? Just looking for more color on that.
John H. Hammergren: Well, clearly, I think both companies have a great track record of customers with strong relationships and long-term relationships with our organization. And those relationships are built by a combination of the quality of the people that we use in the field, both the delivery people, the distribution workers that pick the product to make sure the order's delivered on time. And clearly, the sales force that has a relationship. So we're going to be very careful and very thoughtful about any changes we make that might disrupt those customer relationships. And frankly, there's things we can learn from both of our approaches relative to distribution and transportation that we need to take the sort of the best of the best approach in the marketplace. So I think I don't want to get too specific, but I think we believe they're significant value from the combination. And we should make sure that we're very careful about preserving what we're doing. Our synergy number that we provided, we think, is appropriate and will not cause significant disruption that will be noticed by our customers as a result of taking out the cost.
Operator: Moving on, we'll take our question again from Tom Gallucci from Lazard Capital Markets.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: I guess, 2 questions. Just the first one was on the process, if you can give us any background on the deal itself, how it came together? And anything in that realm, that’d be helpful.
John H. Hammergren: Well, obviously, we have had a long-term industry relationship with PSS World Medical. And as I mentioned on with Steven, I think that our organizations know each other well. We've competed well in the field, and I think that we have had mutual admiration for the cultures built by both companies. And so I think as you would expect, off and on over the years, we probably have had lots of conversations about opportunities. And all I would say is that the door was made available to us when the discussion opened up around their extended care business. And through those discussions, we were able to expand the discussion to talk about the larger transaction. We know these businesses well. We have a strong footprint in the primary care and physician business as well as in extended care. And I think that relationship over decades really in the marketplace has afforded us the opportunity.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then, you did mention a couple of the IT deals that you had done. Med3000, I thought, was a decent size. Could you guys offer any color on the financial impact there both in terms of balance sheet as well as income statement?
John H. Hammergren: Let me talk a little bit about the strategy and then Jeff, perhaps, can talk about the financials of the transaction. You're right, Med3000 is slightly larger than the MedVentive deal. The Med3000 deal fits nicely with the assets that had been previously acquired by Per-Se, and then acquired by McKesson when we acquired Per-Se. We believe we are the market leader in revenue cycle management and services, like billing and collections, with physician offices in this country, and we've got a very good model to make that happen. And we are pleased to bring the Med3000 team into the fold. Frankly, their model is a little more expansive, not as scaled as ours. But it goes into other areas of the marketplace where we are looking to build our capabilities, and so we're excited to bring that team on. And it's got a great leadership and management team, and I think it'll move us strategically. The MedVentive deal, as you mentioned, is more of a technology asset. And that fills a need -- bringing together several of the McKesson existing assets as our customers struggle with the complexity associated with trying to manage patient populations and be at risk for those populations. And so I think that, that also positions us well. A frankly smaller scale and -- but that company has been around almost a decade, perhaps slightly longer. So they've been working on this process of taking a longitudinal view of a patient and their care for a long time. So they both fit nicely for us. And Jeff, maybe you could talk a little bit about the financing?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, from a financial perspective, Tom, in the near-term, both deals have an immaterial impact on the income statement. And from a cash and purchase price perspective, they're small enough. So we won't be breaking out the specific purchase price which just tells you that the cash involved is not material relative to the $2 billion to $2.5 billion of operating cash flow we'll have this year. Certainly, as they close, you'll see in our cash flow statement next quarter our total spending on all the acquisitions that closed in the quarter.
Operator: Moving on, we'll take our next question from Lisa Gill, JPMorgan.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I have a couple -- I just had a couple of questions. John, maybe bigger picture, we've been talking in the last few quarters about hospitals buying physician practices and how that market is changing and hearing about what margins will look like going forward. Can you talk to us about what you see going forward under ACA, should it stay? And physicians buying -- I'm sorry -- hospitals buying physician practices, and what this means to now be the leader in that marketplace?
John H. Hammergren: Sure, Lisa. Clearly, we have to continue to evolve our model as our customers aggregate together perhaps in larger practices, or as you said, some of them have chosen to sell their practices to hospitals or to IDNs. What's great about McKesson is we have a very, I think, a strong relationship and an understanding for the acute side of the business. As you may recall, we had an acute Med-Surg business at one point, which we sold. But our knowledge of that marketplace, in how hospitals operate and hospital GPOs operate, I think, has benefited us as we've evolved our model to provide service and solutions to customers who either are existing customers who are being acquired and want to remain with McKesson or -- and frankly, new customers that have been acquired by hospitals, where hospitals are struggling with a more unified approach to their supply chain requirements. Clearly, the acute care distributors stand in a position to compete with us for that business, but because they have a position in the hospital space. But we also think there's an opportunity for us to continue to service these customers, and we have had very little customer attrition through an acquisition by a health system or a hospital. And I think the priority for those health systems, frankly, is not the 1% or 2% of the supply chain cost that those physicians may represent of their entire medical-surgical spend, I think they're more focused on the productivity and efficiency and alignment those physicians might have with the enterprise, particularly if they're trying to build a at-risk ACO or PCMH kind of a model. And so I think that to the extent that they can put the logistics and supply chain requirements behind them and not have to disrupt that productivity by making significant changes in distribution, they benefit. So we have successfully navigated with our customers these changes in their ownership models, and I think we're well positioned to handle the scale requirements that are necessary for hospital customers. Having said that, clearly, we have competitors on the acute care side that have an avenue into this marketplace, and we have to be vigilant on our value proposition.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then just as a follow-up, John, for you or Jeff. How do we think about the synergies that you talked about, the $100 million, is that just cost? Or do you think that there's some level of revenue synergies, especially from an IT perspective? My understanding is that today, Athena has a relationship with PSS. So do you see that as a future revenue relationship opportunity?
John H. Hammergren: Well, just to answer the question directly, our synergy model is really all cost base, and we believe we have a line of sight to those synergies. It'll take us some time, as Jeff and I have mentioned, this is not an easy process and we want to make sure that we're not disrupting our customer relationships. But we -- to the extent that there's upside in this from a revenue and a value proposition perspective, we'll continue to build that out, and that's not included in the numbers that we provided this morning. As it relates to relationships that PSS World Medical may have with others in the industry, whether they're on a laboratory side, frankly, in terms of their sourcing and their power in that space or whether it's on the technology side, as you noted, there may be opportunities for us to leverage what they're doing through our sales force, and we look forward to that. And if they have relationships with companies that McKesson has been unable to build, we look forward to extending those relationships across our footprint. And at the end, even to the extent that we might have some competition with McKesson's internal capabilities across the footprint, we're not going to -- out of the gate discourage any or dismantle any of the relationships that PSS World Medical has built without careful evaluation. Athenahealth has built a great model, I know the team there. And their model, frankly, is a little different than the model we have in our REMS business. We have a different physician practice target that we're looking at compared to what they're doing, and so I wouldn't jump to any conclusions.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, great. And then I know I'm only supposed to be asking 2 but I just want a clarification here. Does the transaction include the Elder Care Business because I know you're in the long-term care business as well?
John H. Hammergren: Yes. The transaction is for PSS World Medical, as it stands today. The transaction that had been spoken about by the PSS World Medical management relative to their extended care platform is where we began. But that is no longer going to be sold as a separate asset.
Operator: Moving on, we'll go to Eric Coldwell from Robert W. Baird.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I want to follow up -- I think, it was Tom's question, and you addressed most of it. But you did mention during the call that you expect your Technology Solutions outlook to be the same as before. And previously, you'd stated Technology Solutions growth similar to last year's rate of about 4%. Since then, you've acquired 2 businesses, which on a full year basis, would add about 5 points to growth by my math. So I'm curious if you've just not included the acquisition revenue performance? Or if you're implicitly showing us that Technology Solutions' underlying organic growth is perhaps a little less than you originally expected?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, the key here clearly is the acquisitions are closing late in the year and have no actually material impact on our revenues this year. So our view of the underlying performance of the organic MTS businesses hasn't changed at all.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Jeff, I'm sorry if I missed this one, when do you expect the acquisitions to close?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, they're closing in the third -- late in the second quarter and sometime during the third quarter.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: So about a 0.5 year influence? Okay, that's good.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Yes.
Operator: Moving on, we'll go to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I just wanted to go back to the sales force question and then on the synergies. Obviously, this is largely sales force-driven market. So I was hoping if you could share some thoughts on maybe the different approach from the 2 companies as it relates to that. And then maybe how you're thinking about the overall sales footprint once McKesson Medical and PSS are combined.
John H. Hammergren: Well, we have a great admiration for the sales force that has been built over time at PSS World Medical. And we believe strongly that sales force is one of the points of significant value in this transaction, as is the Medical-Surgical sales force at McKesson. And so we hope that we will be able to retain all of the sales reps on both sides. Our synergy case has no reduction in sales force modeled into it, and we don't plan to reduce the size of our sales footprint at all. Now we'll have to do some reconciliation in the marketplace relative to territories so that -- we have some overlaps in certain markets and what we're going to do there. But all in all, I would hope that the sales forces in both companies look at this as a significant opportunity because we expand what's in their bag. And the culture and economic models for the reps are very similar, I don't think that there'll be a compensation surprise for the sales force. And as I said, we're focused on retaining them. The other part of that is the service model behind it. The distribution networks and the ability to deliver -- the ability to make sure that the product is available. All of those infrastructure capabilities may change slightly. But our goal is to make sure that we don't disrupt the expectation from a service perspective that our customers have become dependent on. So I think that this should be seen as real positive by the sales forces.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. And then, Jeff, if I could just ask one on the quarter. The operating margin was particularly strong in the Distribution business. And by your account, this wasn't an outsized quarter for exclusive launches per se. And I know you mentioned the timing around the antitrust and the manufacturer compensation, I was wondering if maybe you could just talk about the drivers of that margin in the quarter. And then what things should we be thinking about tempering in the back half relative to the revised guidance that you gave us?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, you are correct. The quarter was strong but it was particularly strong driven by just the timing of there being strong brand price increases, and that just pulls forward in most cases, what you would otherwise have expected to get over the course of the year from our brand manufacturers. The favorable antitrust settlement was a significant item that we certainly didn't expect to happen this early in the year. So those are really the 2 things, combined with the fact that, as you point out, it was really strong oral generics quarter as we all expected that drove the margin rate in the quarter so high. But since the first 2 of them really just have to do with timing, that's why you don't see that much change in our view for the year. And we've ticked up a little bit our expectation of the full year margin expansion in Distribution Solutions. But that's mainly driven by that change in our outlook on warehouse revenues because as our warehouse revenues come down a little bit, that does add a little bit to the margin.
Operator: Moving on, we'll take our next question from Robert Willoughby from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: John, could you hazard a guess of market share for each of the franchises post-transaction? And then maybe secondarily, we've never seen PSS World's ROIC ever tick above 6%. Admittedly, it's been a comedy of strategic mishaps historically. But the $100 million synergy estimate just doesn't seem like, to me, that it gets -- gives you much leverage to ever improve that metric? So what's -- is there -- what can you say about the secret sauce here that really justifies the deal premium here?
John H. Hammergren: Well, Robert, I had a hunch you might have a view on the Medical-Surgical business given our history together. I don't think that if you actually look inside of our Medical-Surgical business, you'd see very healthy ROIC characteristics. And in particular, that business has gained significant momentum once we sold our acute care business. And so I think that we believe strongly that we can get a good return on the investment in PSS World Medical and that we also can continue to improve not only the ROIC of the acquired asset but the combined assets' ROIC will improve over time. And as you know, when we model acquisitions, we model acquisitions with a long-term view of our cost of capital and a very laser-like focus on our ability to continue to improve ROIC in the company. As it relates to the shares of these businesses, although we will be a very large player in all of our, alternate-site markets, they still are highly fragmented. And I would tell you that it remains extremely competitive in the marketplace. So I think that the combination of the 2 companies clearly is an opportunity for us to create value. But I don't think anybody should assume that this isn't going to remain a competitive industry in both extended care, primary care, home care, all the other alternate-site markets that we compete in.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And do you have a capital savings number, John, to go with that $100 million cost savings number?
John H. Hammergren: Well clearly, we would expect capital to be taken out of the business as we rationalize inventory investments and focus on credit and collections, the kinds of things that we do very well. And I'm sure we will be taking investment out. Now having said that, there will probably be some facility and other capital requirements as we go through this. But certainly, the day-to-day working capital should come down in the business.
Operator: Moving on, we'll take our next question from Ross Muken from ISI Group.
Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Can you talk a bit about, in the IT business, sort of the Paragon transition what you've seen so far, what the feedback's been, how you feel about sort of the momentum you have in that side of the software hospital market?
John H. Hammergren: Sure, Ross. The Paragon transition is a part of our, MPT business, which is a part of MTS. And Paragon is our electronic medical record and health care information systems product lines, both the financial and the clinical, for, primarily, the hospital or IDN marketplace. The transition you're referring to is our work with our customers to migrate them from our Horizon platform for clinicals to the Paragon platform for clinicals because we believe it drives a significant amount of efficiency, and it's a lot less costly to own and to operate. That transition has gone well for us in the marketplace. We have had some customer attrition, primarily driven by customers' requirements that Paragon doesn't currently have. But I think that customers that have transitioned to Paragon have great confidence that we will continue to build out our capability, particularly in the nonhospital part of the applications that need to be built in ambulatory. So I would say that we're on, or ahead, of our business case in that transition across the board. There have been some customer losses in that segment or that product line, but I would tell you that, that attrition is in line with our expectations.
Operator: Moving on, we'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Yes. Can you give us some color on the CVS RFP process? And secondly, with the implied second half guidance a little bit lower than we expected, is it just solely a function of the pull forward of the $19 million benefit in the price increases? And was the timing of the Rite Aid renewal factored into that updated guidance as well?
John H. Hammergren: As we discussed in our earlier remarks, we typically don't talk about our customers or our competitors' customers, for that matter, relative to their status, relative to contracting. So I guess I would say that on a global basis, we remain committed to the renewal of our customer base and to competing them the full value that we deliver for our customers over time. We have a long track record of renewing our relationships. About 1/3 of our business every year comes up for renewal, and our track record of success in that has been, I think, very good. And so we would hope that we would continue to earn the privileges serving our customers, and that's, I guess, my view. And Jeff, maybe you could talk a little bit regarding quarters?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Sure. I think, Ricky, relative to where we started the year, there's probably 4 things that have pulled forward, just from a timing perspective, into the first half of the year versus the second half of the year. So you've got the manufacturer economics driven by the way our agreements work in some of the strong brand price increases that many people have commented on in the marketplace. We did have the favorable antitrust settlement, which was sizable, a $19 million settlement. We have seen the tax discrete items that we anticipated for the year would be much more front end or first half-loaded than we expected. And last, although much smaller, as I also mentioned, we do, just the timing of how we're managing our balance sheet, we expect to do a little bit of debt refinancing in the back half, that's going to tip our interest expense up a little bit. And as I said in my remarks, that's independent of how we ultimately choose to finance the PSS transaction. So those items really are what caused us to feel we are solidly on track with our plan for the year. It has ended up a little bit more front end-loaded than we had expected, but we feel good about our numbers for the full year.
Operator: Moving on, we'll take our next question from George Hill with Citi.
George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: John, following up on Lisa's question a little bit, just big picture. You guys have just made a $3 billion commitment to the ambulatory setting or the physician practice market. Just can you tell us how does McKesson think about the longer term viability of the physician practice market and the direction of the independent physician practices, given the acquisition of PSS and Med3000?
John H. Hammergren: Well, we believe that the physician market is going to remain very robust. And in fact, if you actually think about what's going on in the marketplace, particularly the consolidation of physicians into the acute care setting, it's really an indication of the importance those physician practices, the important role those physician practices play in the total delivery of health care. If you don't have a line of physicians in the care network, you're never going to get at the issue of cost and quality and health care the way that we need to as a nation. And so we believe strongly that the physicians are going to remain in more and more demand. There aren't enough of them to satisfy the patient demands that are out there today. And demographics are only going to increase the import of physicians. I want to be clear in my view on this relative to the -- where physicians might reside, whether they're large physician groups in clinic settings, or they're parts of surgery centers, or they're acquired by hospitals in their -- in the satellite of those hospitals. And we don't believe that our business model is impacted negatively at all. And in fact, if anything, as our customers become more sophisticated, our sophisticated solutions meet their needs. We probably agree with a general view that physician practices that are 1 or 2 folks in a box down the street are probably under some pressure to aggregate either into a health care system or into a practice group of some kind. But we've been growing nicely in those settings. And you've seen these consolidation and physician practices underway perhaps for the last several years, yet you've seen McKesson's ability to grow through that because we'd come at the solution set with a more robust set of tools for our sales forces and our management teams to use to meet the needs of our customers. So these ambulatory customers that are being acquired, I think, will be as, or more, dependent on the services McKesson can provide as compared to the past. And on the Med3000 acquisition, or our REMS business, frankly, most of the physicians in those businesses are physicians that are already practicing in hospitals. They're emergency room doctors, they're anesthesiologists, they're radiology doctors. And so I think that this movement into a more connected health care system from a delivery perspective, and once again, if anything, a positive on what we do there because our customers are aggregating together in larger settings. And the complexity of what they're doing with -- from a billing and payment perspective, is only increasing. So I think that our skill sets fit perfectly with where we think health care is going, and we're excited to bring these assets together.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: And John, I might just add 1 financial comment, which is if you combine the $2.1 billion we're spending on PSS and Med3000, you don't get anywhere near a number that would round to $3 billion. So I know we haven't broken out, in fairness, George, the purchase price on Med3000, but I would tell you we wouldn't get anywhere near that range.
John H. Hammergren: Yes. When you said immaterial, with -- materiality would certainly start below $1 billion for that increment.
Operator: Moving on, we'll take our next question from John Ransom with Raymond James.
John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Jeff, let's just assume for simplicity, this deal closes at the beginning year, fiscal '14's. What, say -- we can probably back into these numbers, but I'd like to get your take on what sort of EBITDA contribution you would think about for PSSI in fiscal '14 as well as what the first year synergies might look like?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, I think, John, I don't probably want to go beyond the comments I made in my script, which is if it were to close March 31, we'd expect the transaction, if you were to assume it was fully debt-financed at 4%, to be $0.15 to $0.25 accretive on an adjusted basis. And our very rough estimate right now in terms of intangible amortization, it'd probably be about $100 million a year. So you could -- the synergies in this case do happen over a more extended period of time than we see in many of these kinds of transactions because as John, I think, has really articulated, there's a lot of good things at both companies that we are going to very thoughtfully think about as we go through how to take the best of both companies and create something of real value for our customers. So the synergies will be relatively modest in year 1 and then grow significantly as the years go by. So I think I'd probably prefer to leave my comments at that, and you can probably take a good cut at the EBITDA based on those.
Operator: Moving on, we'll take our next question from David Larsen from Leerink Swann.
David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: It looks like the operating expenses within the Distribution division came in better than I was looking for, maybe an improvement sequentially, can you talk about what drove that? Was that, possibly, tape synergies? And then also, was there any benefit on a relaunch of generic oxaliplatin in the quarter? And then just lastly, the U.S. Pharma bulk revenue came in later than I was looking for, maybe a sequential decline there, was that driven mainly by generics? Maybe 5 fewer days? Or was there something else going on there?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: I'll tick those off one at a time. On expense, there's really no single driver of the good expense management in Distribution Solutions other than all of our businesses and what is always a competitive environment really, doing a great job of managing across the board. On oxaliplatin, I would say, yes, it relaunched. And yes, that was in our results. It is not particularly material to us. And certainly, the economics around it are nothing like what the industry saw on its previous launch. So it's certainly a nice thing, but it is not -- nothing like last time. On bulk, you are correct that relative to our original expectations, our warehouse revenues were a little softer. There's really a couple of things going on. They vary a lot from quarter-to-quarter because it's driven by the purchasing patterns of a handful, less than a handful really, of big customers. All of those big customers have much broader relationships with us with lots of direct buying as well. So sometimes they choose to buy more direct and less warehouse, and that's actually a good thing for us. But it drops the warehouse revenue line. And then, the third thing going on there is we have seen, on some of the new generic launches, a little bit larger dropoff in our warehouse revenues due to those launches than we had anticipated. So that's not something that has a material impact on the bottom line, but does impact that revenue line.
Operator: We'll take our final question from Charles Rhyee from Cowen and Company.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Can I just -- maybe a more market question for you, John. And it really, so I guess, the med-surg. And obviously, we're hearing some comments about sort of weak utilization volumes in the market from companies across many subsectors, health care. Can you give us some comments on what you're seeing, I guess, first in the physician market? And then secondly, maybe more broadly, what you're seeing across all your businesses?
John H. Hammergren: Well, we have -- I think we have a pretty good dial tone on what's going on in health care because of the breadth of our service offering. And as we talked about earlier, with the Med3000 acquisition and our REMS business, where we actually do patient office billing. We have a pretty good insight into the actual frequency of visits and the types of visits that might be going on. I don't think we've seen a significant change in the cadence of health care this year compared to last, and I think that we haven't seen a big change in the last quarter compared to the quarter before that. So I think our businesses actually have been performing quite well, and we have not seen a real step-down now. And clearly, there might be soft spots in certain parts of the market, but overall, we're pleased with our performance and pleased with what we see.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: So -- and just a follow-up there. When you talk about the flat year-over-year, where -- on the res, we're saying it's solely the 5 less business days and -- and within that 8% underlying growth, you wouldn't point to any kind of softness, that it could have been stronger had utilization been better or you're saying that's just been pretty steady?
John H. Hammergren: Yes. I think the 8% is reflective of a slightly better-than-market growth, but we still think that markets are growing in the 4% to 6% kind of range. And that we're competing in a way that is allowing us to grow slightly faster. But I think overall, we still feel good about it. The flatness in the revenue and distribution is driven primarily by generics. And so that when you think about the corporation overall and our ability to grow revenue, it has been impacted by generics, which is a positive thing on the gross margin in the operating income line, but is dampening our revenues. So we'll see that dampening continue through the year and then as we start to go into next year, our revenue line should begin to grow again as generics begin to taper off, at least from this year. I want to thank you all for your time and your questions today, I thought they were terrific. I'm certainly pleased with our accomplishments during the first half of the year and excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. I'll now hand the call over to Erin for some discussions about upcoming events.
Erin Lampert: Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events for the financial community. On November 15, we will present at the Credit Suisse Health Care Conference in Phoenix. And on January 7, we will present at the JPMorgan Health Care Conference in San Francisco. We will release our third quarter earnings results in late January, and we look forward to seeing you at one of these upcoming events. Thank you, and goodbye.
Operator: Thank you, that will conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to McKesson Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert, please go ahead.
Erin Lampert: Thank you, Anthony. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson's Fiscal 2013 First Quarter Earnings Call. With me today are John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and Jeff Campbell, our CFO. John will first provide a business update and will then introduce Jeff, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After Jeff's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after 1 hour at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal securities law. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and certain litigation reserve adjustments. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for investors. Please refer to our press release announcing first quarter fiscal 2013 results available on our website for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thanks, and here is John Hammergren.
John H. Hammergren: Thank you, Erin. And thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Today, we reported a good start to fiscal 2013 with total company revenues of $30.8 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.55. We continue to expect to achieve our adjusted earnings guidance of $7.05 to $7.35 for fiscal 2013. Turning for a moment to the broader industry environment. On June 28, the Supreme Court affirmed that the Affordable Care Act will proceed much as it was originally enacted by Congress. The act will drive many changes in health care in the coming years. But through all of this change, the issues of quality, access and cost will continue to remain at the center of all health care discussions. System-changing reform is taking place throughout health care as payers, providers, manufacturers, pharmacies prepare for the expansion in coverage under the Affordable Care Act. As patient volumes increase, our customers will need to respond with increased efficiency. Our customers will need to continue to reduce cost and improve the quality of patient care through the use of information technology. They will be judged by adherence to evidence-based protocols and improved outcomes. And they will be experimenting with new approaches to reimbursement models, like patient-centered medical home and accountable care. As a leader in health care services and information technology, McKesson has a great opportunity to help our customers meet these goals of reducing costs and promoting value across the health care system. Before I turn to the first quarter results for Distribution Solutions, I'll provide an update on our average wholesale price litigation. As a reminder, McKesson had previously settled all private payer AWP claims during the third quarter of fiscal 2009. During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we completed a settlement of local public entity claims. Most recently, we finalized a settlement of the Federal share of Medicaid claims related to AWP during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Today, we reached final agreement with the Coalition of State Attorneys General to resolve the majority of state Medicaid claims related to AWP. That leaves a few outstanding state cases that we plan to vigorously defend. This settlement represents another important step in bringing resolution to claims related to AWP. Now let me turn back to our operations. Distribution Solutions started the year with solid revenue and operating profit growth. Although it's still very early in our fiscal year, we remain confident in our full-year expectations. As I highlighted in our initial guidance on April 30, fiscal 2013 represents a robust year for all generic launches. McKesson is well-positioned with our strong manufacturer relationships and customer-focused proprietary programs to continue to provide value across our extensive generic offering. We also expect that our broad range of value-added services for branded manufacturers should contribute to steady levels of compensation. We continue to renew and expand our customer footprint in our distribution and wholesale business by delivering unique value to our customers. Like all customers, they are focused on competitive prices and great service. However, in today's health care environment, that alone is not sufficient. Today, our customers have to be more productive, deliver error-free and high-quality care, and increasingly connect to others involved in the financial and care processes, including the patient. As you know, we have a large technology business that is only part of our value proposition as a company. Perhaps, more important today is our ability to use technology in combination with the blocking and tackling of distribution to help all of our customers with their business, clinical and connectivity challenges. Sure, all of our markets are competitive, but no more so than before. The key to our continued success is adding innovation to the equation, which in turn brings value to our customers. That value is being added today with customers from the smallest physician office to the largest retailers in the world. For example, last month our U.S. Pharmaceutical business brought together thousands of independent pharmacy owners and pharmacists to our annual trade show to learn about the industry's latest trends impacting their business. During the event, we underscored McKesson's commitment to helping independent pharmacies achieve better results and better patient health. At the conference we highlighted solutions that helped independent pharmacists enhance patient loyalty and outcomes and broaden the range of services they provide. Solutions like McKesson's sponsored clinical services network, which enables independent pharmacists to play a greater role in providing patient care and services, in addition to growing their revenues. Sponsored clinical services is a network of 13,000 community pharmacies delivering a suite of patient-centered programs, including education, support and behavioral coaching. The network streamlines the relationship between pharmacies, manufacturers and payer-sponsored programs focused on increasing adherence and improving patient care. Participating pharmacies benefit from the opportunity to increase customer loyalty, earn service fees and build their relationships with patients as a partner in their health care. We also demonstrated new social, web and mobile technologies to help our customers connect with their patients and with health care peers in entirely new ways. A significant number of attendees were Heath Mart pharmacy owners and pharmacists. With nearly 3,000 stores across the country, Health Mart has become the franchise model of choice for independent pharmacy owners looking to complement their local identity with a national brand. Health Mart continues to invest in new solutions to help these stores grow their business, including private label over-the-counter health care products and new consumer-facing web and mobile platforms. In our Canadian Distribution business, we performed as we expected in the first quarter. We did have 4 fewer sales days in the quarter compared to prior year. So as a result, revenues were down 4% on a constant currency basis. The team continues to do a tremendous job of integrating the recent acquisition of Katz, and I'm pleased to see the early positive results from these efforts. Turning to our Medical-Surgical business. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of this business. Revenues were up 9% for the quarter. We've enjoyed good organic growth and have gained new primary care and extended care customers in addition. We have a great position in these markets. We offer a compelling value proposition to our customers through the services and technologies that we provide. As physicians move to practices in larger groups, which can be affiliated with or owned by hospitals or integrated delivery networks, McKesson participates in this growth by offering products and technology that service the unique needs of these larger customer markets. And as I mentioned in my opening comments on the distribution segment, it is often our technology that differentiates McKesson in our conversations with customers. For example, our Medical-Surgical business offers technology that helps us customers better track and manage their inventory, saving them time and money. Individual group practice and affiliated physicians also benefit from our revenue management solutions business, which is actually part of our Technology Solutions segment. McKesson Revenue Management Solutions offers leading outsourced financial and billing solutions, helping our physician customers focus their time on providing quality patient care. In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of our Distribution Solutions segment. We are well positioned with our successful proprietary generics program, and we are benefiting from a period of significant generic product introduction. Our recent acquisitions in this segment, US Oncology and the Katz acquisition, are both performing well and adding the important strategic capabilities and scale to better serve our customers. And our Medical-Surgical business continues to win with customers through our combination of great service and great technology. We're off to a solid start, and we are confident in our outlook for the rest of the year. Turning now to Technology Solutions. Our performance across the segment at this early point in the year is in line with our expectations. Revenues were up 4% for the quarter and adjusted operating margins were roughly 13%. We continue to make steady progress across all of our technology businesses. We remain committed to ensuring our customers' success in supporting them on their journey to reaching the important Meaningful Use milestones. The domestic health care services industry is in a period of time where the focus is on automating health care. Taking a step back, all of the time, money and energy spent converting the old paper-based health care data into electronic records will only work if that data can be used by our customers to see trends and make changes in care and affect those trends. By connecting financial information and clinical information, our customers can use their data to not only improve their operations but improve patient outcomes. Across all 3 of our technology businesses, you've heard us talk about the importance of providing business intelligence capability. So I wanted to take a moment to give you a little more insight into what we are doing for our customers. In our Provider Technologies business, we've analytic solutions in more than 1,000 facilities including core McKesson customers and many customers who operate on other core systems. Our analytic solutions enable customers to gather data from across their organizations and present that data to medical staff in a meaningful way to improve patient and business outcomes. This can be done at a high level or at a very detailed level with the common goal of optimizing interaction with and care for the patient. Using our McKesson Enterprise Intelligence Solutions, our customers have achieved significant results. For example, one of our customers use McKesson technology, along with internal process changes, to significantly reduce ventilator-acquired pneumonia in its facilities. They did this by leveraging visual alerts consistent with their protocols for complex care to help caregivers deliver the right care at the right time. Another product recently launched by RelayHealth is RelayAnalytics Pulse. It enables hospitals and health systems to monitor their own key performance metrics and compare their financial health with other organizations and peers. With our other analytic solutions, there is a long lag time between data aggregation and the delivery to the end-user. Some competitive solutions provide benchmarking data that is as much as a year old. RelayAnalytics Pulse provides daily data updates, which is a unique and compelling capability. In our Health Solutions business, actionable business intelligence is core to the underpinning of our payer-focused technology products and services. One example is our claims analysis service, which is part of our broader Total Payment Solution. Customers using McKesson's Total Payment Solution can successfully adjudicate claims under an increasingly complex mix of current and emerging value-based reimbursement methodologies. One of the powerful features of this solution is the embedded claims analysis service, which helps our customers identify opportunities where they can realize additional medical and administrative savings by enhancing their claims payout automation processes. Taking this back to my opening comments on the Supreme Court ruling on the Affordable Care Act. Our analytic solutions are one of the many ways we are focused on helping our customers achieve sustainable cost reduction, provide timely insight to their operations and promote value within the health care system. This is becoming a top-of-mind issue for all of our customers. In summary, I'm pleased with our results this quarter, which represent a good start to fiscal 2013. In addition to our operating performance, we continue to have a strong balance sheet. And our expectation to deliver cash flow from operations between $2 billion and $2.5 billion for fiscal 2013 remains unchanged from our original guidance. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As you've just heard, McKesson delivered solid first quarter results and is off to a good start for the new fiscal year. Let me begin by briefly mentioning 2 items that while not impacting our adjusted earnings, did impact our GAAP results this quarter, specifically, a $16 million AWP litigation charge and the $81 million pretax acquisition-related gain. First, as John highlighted in his remarks, we continue to work through the remaining AWP claims. As a result of the progress made towards resolving these remaining claims, the litigation reserve has been increased by a pretax charge of $16 million. This charge has been recorded in the Distribution Solutions segment, and it equates to $0.04 per diluted share. Second, as I discussed on our April 30 earnings call, in the first quarter we completed a business combination in which we acquired the remaining 50% ownership interest in our corporate headquarters building. The way the accounting rules in this area work, this creates a pretax acquisition-related gain of approximately $81 million. Similar to how we treat other acquisition-related items, this transaction has been excluded from our adjusted earnings results. My remaining comments today will focus on our $1.55 adjusted earnings per share, which as you'll recall excludes 3 types of items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, and certain litigation reserve adjustments. The numbers I'll review in my discussion today will all be based on an adjusted earnings basis and can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 included in today's press release. Let me now turn to our consolidated results for the quarter, which can be found on Schedule 2. Consolidated revenues of $30.8 billion for the quarter, up 3% from the prior year, with both segments contributing nicely to this result. On this 3% revenue growth, adjusted gross profit for the quarter increased 6% to $1.6 billion. Total adjusted operating expenses of $1 billion were up 5% for the quarter, roughly in line with the overall growth of the business. Other income was flat for the quarter at $8 million. Interest expense declined $8 million versus the prior year to $56 million, driven primarily by the repayment of $400 million in long-term debt in February of fiscal 2012. Moving now to taxes. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter of approximately 28% benefited from $17 million of net favorable discrete tax items. As I mentioned at our Investor Day in June, the $17 million of net favorable discrete items did come earlier in the fiscal year than we had originally planned. And as a result, this pure timing shift from later in the fiscal year added roughly $0.06 to $0.07 relative to what we originally expected for our first quarter performance. Looking to the full year, however, we are still tracking to the 31% adjusted tax rate that we included in our original guidance assumptions. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $372 million, up 15% from the prior year. Our adjusted earnings per share was $1.55, an increase of 22% compared to last year's adjusted EPS of $1.27. To wrap up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 6% year-over-year to 240 million. This year-over-year decline is primarily due to the cumulative impact of our share repurchases, which include more than $3.9 billion of share repurchase since Q1 of fiscal 2011. This is a testament to the strength of our cash flows and balance sheet, particularly since over the same time period, we also spent over $3 billion on acquisitions, including US Oncology and the Katz acquisition. Turning back to share count. For fiscal 2013, we continued to expect our full-year average diluted share count will come in around our original guidance assumption of 239 million shares. Let's now move on to our segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3. In Distribution Solutions, overall revenue growth was 3% compared to the same quarter last year. Looking at the components, direct distribution and services revenues were up 2% for the quarter to $21.3 billion. As always, there are some moving pieces here. We had some customer wins and losses, which were roughly offset. We benefited from an increase in volume with certain existing customers. And the branded price increase environment roughly offset the loss in brand revenues from new generic launches. Our warehouse revenues increased 9% year-over-year, primarily benefiting from expanded volumes with existing customers. For the full year, we continue to expect unusually strong growth in our warehouse line. Moving on to Canada. On a reported basis, revenues were down 8% for the quarter. There are really 2 main drivers of this result: the impact of having 4 fewer sales days in the quarter this year; and an unfavorable foreign currency impact. When you adjust for both of these items, Canadian revenues grew 2% for the quarter. We are pleased to see this growth in our Canadian revenues given the government-imposed price reductions on generic drugs that we have been talking about for some time. Staying on Canada for one more minute, I do want to remind you that our Katz acquisition does not have a material impact on revenues as we were already providing distribution services to the Katz stores. The acquisition does, however, favorably impact our adjusted gross profit, and it also added 1 to 2 percentage points to our Distribution Solutions adjusted operating expense growth this quarter. Turning now to Medical-Surgical. Revenues were up a strong 9% for the quarter to $795 million, driven by market growth and new customers. Adjusted gross profit for the segment increased 8% for the quarter to $1.2 billion on the 3% revenue growth. Overall, we are pleased with this result. We did, of course, have tremendous growth in our oral generic profits this quarter. But this was somewhat offset due to the year-over-year decline in specialty generics and also due to the mix impact of the strong warehouse revenue growth we posted. Remember that the impact on our earnings of higher warehouse revenues is quite modest, as we earn lower margins on our warehouse revenues relative to the margins on our direct revenues. Distribution Solutions adjusted operating expenses were up 7% for the quarter, primarily driven by the Katz acquisition and some charges we recorded this quarter related to the optimization of our Canadian network. When you exclude these 2 items, our adjusted operating expense growth was closer to 3% to 4% for the quarter. Adjusted operating margin rates for the quarter were 185 basis points, an improvement of 9 basis points versus the prior year. Given the quarter variability in this segment we always focus, as you know, on full-year margins. In this context, for full year fiscal 2013, we continue to expect adjusted operating margin improvement in the mid- to high-single-digit basis points compared to our full year fiscal 2012 adjusted operating margin rate of 210 basis points. In summary, we are pleased with the solid first quarter performance in Distribution Solutions. Turning now to Technology Solutions. Total revenues were up 4% for the quarter to $838 million, with all businesses in the segment contributing to this growth. Adjusted gross profit for this segment increased 1% to $388 million. Technology Solutions gross R&D spending was $113 million compared to $105 million in the prior year. Of this amount, we capitalized just 6% versus 10% a year ago. Adjusted operating expense increased 6% in the quarter to $280 million, primarily driven by growth in the business and the increase in net R&D spending. Our Technology Solutions adjusted operating profit was down 8% versus a year ago to $109 million. And our adjusted operating margin was 13.01% compared to 14.84% a year ago. Overall, these results were in line with our expectations. As first mentioned on our April 30 earnings call, we continue to expect results in this segment to be weighted towards the back half of this fiscal year. And with respect to the full year, we continue to expect our adjusted operating margin to be in the low end of our long-term Technology Solutions adjusted operating margin goal range of mid-teens or 14% to 16%. Leaving our segment performance and turning briefly to the balance sheet and our working capital metrics. As you've heard me say before, each of our working capital metrics can be impacted by timing, including the timing of payments or what day of week marks the close of any given quarter. So this quarter our receivables were $9.6 billion, up from the prior year balance of $9.4 billion, with our days sales outstanding decreasing to 24 days from 25 days last year. Compared to a year ago, inventories increased 6% to $10 billion, and our payables increased 4% to $15.2 billion. This resulted in our days sales and inventory increasing by 1 day to 31 days, with our day sales in payables also increasing by 1 day to 47 days. In the quarter, we used $552 million in operating cash flow. There were 2 primary drivers of this result, which is a little unusual. First to remind you, in the quarter we made $273 million of payments on previously accrued AWP liabilities. Second, this quarter was impacted by some inventory purchasing in payable patterns that should reverse out in the September quarter. So overall for the full year, we continue to expect our cash flows from operations will be between $2 billion and $2.5 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2 billion, and we remain confident in our ability to create shareholder value through the continued use of our portfolio approach to capital deployment. Overall, our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 33.2% for the quarter, well within our target range of 30% to 40%. Internal capital spending was $84 million for the quarter, and we continue to expect full year internal capital spending between $425 million and $475 million. Now I'll turn to our outlook. Our first quarter results were solid and on track. And as John mentioned earlier, we're maintaining our guidance on adjusted earnings of $7.05 to $7.35. One other point about our fiscal 2013 outlook, we expect $0.54 for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and due to the AWP litigation charge we recorded this quarter, we're now assuming $0.04 for litigation reserve adjustments. In addition, as a result of the $81 million pretax acquisition-related gain, we now expect acquisition expenses and related adjustments to add approximately $0.19. Thanks. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Glen Santangelo from Crédit Suisse.
Glen J. Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I just want to ask a couple of quick questions on the out margin within your Distribution Solutions segment. John, what I was wondering about, given some of the high-profile deals in the marketplace, if you're seeing that have any impact on pricing, in particular your sell side margins as it relates to new business. And secondarily, I was curious if you're seeing anything new with respect to branded price inflation or generic pricing that maybe makes you more or less confident in the margin outlook.
John H. Hammergren: Well, let me start at end of that conversation and work my way back the other way. On the branded and generic pricing, our trends are basically in line with what our expectations were as we came out with our plans for the year. Albeit a couple of big launches early in this quarter probably were a little more competitive than we had expected. But in the mix of things, we're feeling pretty good about where branded and generic price trends seem to be headed. But obviously it's still early in the year. As it relates to pricing and margins delivered through our customer relationships, as you know we focus on long-term value with our long-term customers. And we continue, as I had mentioned in my prepared remarks, to sell solutions and technology to our customers in combination with distribution that helps to differentiate what we do every day. I think that's obvious in our margin structure that we not only do a great job of delivering day-to-day service in a very productive way and really low-cost, but we also, I think, are afforded an opportunity to sell solutions to our customers that enhance their performance and deliver sustainable value that may take the focus more on value delivered rather than price for the service. And we think that's the way customers should make decisions, and we try to stay out of price-oriented conversations. And one last comment on market pricing. As you know, we spend most of our time focused on our existing customers, so I can't tell you I have a big experience set with the new customer comment that you made, because we don't bring on a lot of new customers. We've been focused heavily on our existing business and making sure those renewals are happening the way they always have historically.
Operator: We will hear our next question from Larry Marsh with Barclays.
Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So I guess I'd like to -- my question really centers on some of the comments you made at your Analyst Day. And I just want to tie that in with some of your comments today. It seems like the theme certainly of the Analyst Day was around the balance of the business, the mix of business that's allowing you great results over a longer period of time and obviously very solid results. Today, you continue that trend. In addition to that, though, you've got an outlook that I think, John, you highlighted, is going to be subject to a lot of change with health care reform, in an environment with a greater focus in the customer environment around generics and the value proposition there. My question is really, as you think about this year, you've gotten customer relationships that are up for renewal toward the end of the year. You've had a really good record of renewing those. You also have another, I guess, a grocery customer who said they may be up for sale. So how do you balance that? And, I guess, specifically my question is, in an environment where everybody is chasing after generic dollars, what are you doing specifically in this environment to differentiate yourselves, so that the conversation moves away from just pricing and continues to drive toward what you define as a differentiated value proposition?
John H. Hammergren: I think the pressure that our customers are feeling this year is probably not that much different than the pressures they've felt in the past. I think we've always had a competitive environment. And certainly, our customers have always been afforded the opportunity to not only buy from other wholesalers, but they have been afforded the opportunity to buy generics from various channels, including direct. And our challenge over the years has been to build a portfolio of capabilities both in terms of the price of the product that we provide, but also in terms of the service that we can provide, in particular, to our customers on generics that they may not be able to deliver on their own or in some other model. Obviously, there's tremendous operational efficiency to place one order at night, and the next day receive all of your product to all of your stores from McKesson and not have to fragment those orders through your own internal capabilities, through some kind of an internal direct sourcing capability, or to fragment it through other smaller companies that are out there trying to sell generics as a sole offering. And our ability to focus our customers on the total value that we deliver has to remain key and our ability to remain disciplined around the price that we deliver to the marketplace, charging for the value that we deliver not chasing commodity price-oriented deals and focusing on those customers that really appreciate what we do. I think if we didn't have confidence that we could continue to expand our margins in spite of some of these pressures that continue, we wouldn't have guided this year to the margin expansion that we've already guided to. And clearly we are already above the market and believe that we can continue to be relative to our peers in terms of operating margin because of the mix of our business, because of the value that we sell, because of the discipline in our selling process, and our focus on those -- continued evolution of that strategy. Having said all of that, clearly things can change. Our view is that nothing's changed thus far, and things remain competitive but stable, but it's always one of those deals that you have to pay attention to what's going on in the market and stay focused. But I think we remain optimistic, Larry. Nothing's really changed from our Analyst Meeting.
Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Great, okay. And just a follow-up maybe, Jeff. I think you did a good job of calling out the tax good guy, I guess, at the Analyst Meeting which obviously you saw. And the message is the rest of the year is going to sort of accrue [ph]. Back to that, as you say, 31%. So notwithstanding the fact you usually don't think about guiding the quarters or the puts and takes, now that you've gotten through the first quarter, is there anything of note that would lead you to think about any different progression of earnings versus last year then for the next couple of quarters?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, the short answer, Larry, is really no. This was the one big group of tax planning initiatives that we thought we'd get to this year and it came a little earlier. The rest of the tax rate will be similar, and boy, our quarterly results the rest of the year will be subject to all the same kind of variability we always have, including a back-half loaded Technology Solutions, a quarter of the usual strong March quarter in Distribution Solutions just due to the structure of our agreements with many brand manufacturers. But I think really none of that is particularly different from we were on April 30.
Operator: We'll hear our next question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I just wanted to follow up on a comment, John, that you made around the strong warehouse sales and the fact that you expect them to continue. Can you just talk about what you're seeing from a customer perspective around warehouse sales? And then secondly, the inventory purchases -- is that tied to the increase in warehouse sales? Or are you seeing opportunities from an inventory appreciation perspective?
John H. Hammergren: It's really not inventory, Lisa, as much as existing customers who are gaining some share, and I think a continued view that our warehousing operations provide benefit to those customers and synergy that they otherwise wouldn't obtain on their own. And as you know, some of our larger customers have experienced some share shift this year as a result of contracts that they may have won that will flow through that or market share changes that have taken place in the chains that have been very visible in the industry. So other than that, there really hasn't been any significant action. And I don't know, Jeff, you might have something you would want to add there.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Yes, I'll just make 2 points. On warehouse sales, I'd just remind you that, that's really not a standalone product. It's a combination that's very valuable to certain of our very largest customers who also do lots of direct store business with us. And we think of those relationships as an overall economic relationship. On the cash issue, I -- maybe I managed to confuse people. So the day of the week that the quarter ended and just the way we happened to have some of our inventory purchases fall, drove a bunch of cash into the September quarter that in past years would have fallen into the June quarter. It had absolutely nothing to do actually with the growth in warehouse sales from one of our larger customers and certainly wasn't tied to -- if you go back a few years with anything going on, on the buy side. It's really just timing of when things got stocked up.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then I guess just as one other follow-up would just be around med-surg. You talked about 9% growth in the quarter, which was very good growth. Can you just talk about what you're seeing as far as underlying growth for that business segment versus what it sounds like some competitive wins in the segment in the quarter?
John H. Hammergren: Yes, I think that the market growth rates, Lisa, are probably in the 3% to 4% range. You might recall that we have a strong position in physician office. We have a strong position in long-term care. And we have a strong position in home health care and sort of the miscellaneous side of things. And all 3 of those segments had -- or pieces of the business had very strong growth and above-market growth. I think our combination of service and the technology offering that I mentioned earlier that has really changed the face of just delivering product to delivering more complete solutions has made a difference. And the migration of physicians out of small practices into more aggregated practices -- we're seeing that phenomenon both at US Oncology, our revenue cycle management business, and our med-surg business, where this aggregation actually plays to our strengths. Because these customers are more sophisticated, they're more technologically oriented, and they appreciate the value that we deliver. They're not just price oriented. They're more value focused and we're able to beat the competition, who primarily have been focused on moving boxes from point a to point b at a low price. And so I think that this larger value proposition is helping us win in med-surg.
Operator: We will take our next question from Bob Willoughby from Bank of America.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: You guys came in well under my D&A assumption for the year. I was just kind of curious, is this in the ballpark of a run rate to use going forward? And can you comment on just the other income line? There was a nice gain there, but what's the run rate for the year on that line item?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, so on the D&A -- do you mean overall D&A, Bob, or are you talking about the acquisition-related amortization?
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just what your target for the year would be.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, on the acquisition-related amortization -- just pulling it out here, for the full year, we think it will be about $0.54 based on all the acquisitions that have been completed to date. If you are looking at broader depreciation and amortization, there's not really anything going on unusual from quarter-to-quarter. So you should really be able to take that number and just annualize it.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: With the Katz deal, I was surprised it didn't rise, though, in the first quarter.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, remember we've been an acquisitive company for many, many years. And so when you think about acquisition-related amortization, some of it starts to drop off over time. And so I might remind you, for example, we bought Per-Se back in 2007 or thereabouts, and so some of those charges are starting to roll off.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And just the other income. There's some variability there. What's a good run rate?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: The other income is going to vary by a little bit each quarter, but there's nothing particularly unusual this quarter. And so I would still take a mixture of look at last year's number, look at this quarter's number and annualize it and pick something in the middle, and that's going to get you pretty close.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Tom Gallucci from Lazard.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: John, I'm not sure if there's an easy way to answer this first question, but certainly I think you talked about your, sort of, your total value proposition as one way to sort of combat the competitive pressures out there and help your customers become more efficient over time. Is there any measure that you can point to in terms of maybe multiple services per customer or something like that, that we can actually see how you're gaining from that standpoint and having that broader array of offerings?
John H. Hammergren: Well, I think if you look at our track record over the last decade, we've been able to show evidence of our ability to not only grow in line with the marketplace in almost all of our businesses or above in the businesses where there's still opportunities like med-surg, for example. And I think that the fact that our margins have expanded at a nice rate show that there's a value orientation to what we're doing. And our customers aren't only focused on price, and we're selling that value. And you've heard us talk about our various offerings on calls like this and our analyst meetings and with customers if you go to various events that we might be having. And I think a good example would be our ability to, for independent pharmacies, to tie our own software systems for point-of-sale and the automation of the pharmacy dispensing process behind the counter with our RelayHealth pharmacy network to help them adjudicate their claims and optimize their performance along with the automation equipment behind the counter to help them reduce labor and improve productivity and then wrap that in the Health Mart franchise. There are very few -- probably not any companies in the industry that can combine wholesaling with all of that capability under one umbrella in a more integrated way. And surely our, for example, Relay would have share in our competitors' customers from a distribution perspective. But when we tie it into our own customer base, our customers realize the value that they otherwise wouldn't achieve, because of the integration with the systems we're able to provide. So as a simple example, and clearly internally as we manage our book of businesses, we look at the overlap between hospital and distribution and pharmaceuticals with the physician office distribution of medical supplies in those same integrated networks with the IT footprint we have installed and the robotic systems we have in place and the cabinets we have on the floor. So you'll recall that 10 years ago, other companies were pursuing this more integrated approach. And I think that today, we're really the only ones that have got the technology footprint to pull it off. And I think it's been successful for us. Now clearly that success, Tom, wouldn't happen if we couldn't get the price right and the service right. That earns us the privilege to talk about these other things.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Sure, okay. Fair enough. That's good. And then you touched on the competitive landscape. I think a lot of those comments were sort of more focused on the traditional oral solids side of the business. Is there -- how would you characterize the landscape at this stage of the game in the specialty side? Obviously some peers maybe trying to build that business. Others have been in it, and are pretty big and maybe defending some turf. So is there anything unusual or new going on there?
John H. Hammergren: Well, I think the biggest change we've seen in the specialty side of the business is the continued interest that physicians have to reach out and get help from someone who's capable of providing that help. And so standalone community oncologists, as an example, are looking for opportunities to automate, opportunities to buy better, opportunities to improve their ability to attract and retain talent and manage their offices, attract patients, adopt best-demonstrated protocols, a whole myriad of things that have caused them to have an increased interest in networking with each other. And clearly our acquisition of US Oncology not only provided us with significant scale, but gave us some capabilities, frankly, that are untouched in the industry in terms of our ability to have an intimate relationship with the physician, allowing them to get back to clinical care, while we take over some of the administrative tasks. Now clearly some of them may choose to sell out to a hospital and some may choose to move into a group that's not affiliated with US Oncology. But I think the days of independent physicians in probably all of our markets are beginning to wane, and the aggregation of physicians plays well to the strategy that McKesson has been laying out for the last decade, and I think we'll benefit from that. But as it relates to competitive pressures in these markets, I think it's fair to say that distribution has always been competitive. And it's particularly competitive if you find it difficult to differentiate your service. So we have been attempting to train our sales force to sell on value. We try to incent them to maintain these relationships and renew them over time. We try not to chase price-oriented-only buyers because it ends up as a futile exercise anyway. And I think we have been successful at that.
Operator: Our next question will come from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: It just looks like you guys you ended the quarter here with about $2 billion in cash. So just looking at an update on potentially implementing a more meaningful buyback in this fiscal year. Or are there maybe specifically areas that you guys are evaluating right now on the M&A front? Just looking for an update around capital deployment.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, a couple of things. I'd remind you that, yes, we ended with $2 billion of cash. And while we don't call out the offshore cash each quarter, back in March, it was about $1.4 billion. So a good chunk of that cash is offshore. Certainly, we build into our plan each year some amount of share repurchase. We don't call that out publicly. And, frankly, we manage a little bit based on what the acquisition environment offers us, how the year is going relative to the overall targets we've set, et cetera. We have, as a reminder, about $1 billion in outstanding authorization right now from our board. On acquisitions, I don't think anything has changed. So as usual, we see a range of alternatives and opportunities across almost all of our businesses in both segments, where there are companies out there that we think we could uniquely create some value with. But, boy, it's tough to predict when any of those companies are either available for sale or, much more importantly, available for sale at prices that make any sense for our shareholders.
John H. Hammergren: Sure, it's also fair to say there's lots of volatility in those valuations as you look at the quarters tick by. So I think patience has been one of our virtues as well.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Fair enough. Just to confirm then around the guidance obviously reaffirm the EPS range. I assume that the full year diluted share count that you laid out is intact then?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Correct. In fact, I specifically pointed out that we are sticking with our 239 million share outstanding for the year assumption.
John H. Hammergren: Built into that guidance.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Built into the guidance, correct.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I appreciate that. And just one if I could sneak in on the Technology Solutions segment. It looks like you're a little bit shy of the long-term target. I know you said today that you expect to be in that low teens range. Just curious if there was anything specific in the quarter that weighted below that average or maybe what you guys expect over the next 3 quarters that should get it back into that range?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, this is really mechanically as simple as we told you back in April 30. This year would be unusually back-end loaded just due to some product GAs that we have in the back half of the year that will hold up wherever I can tell they happen later in the year. And so actually the quarter came in very much as we had expected.
Operator: We'll move to our next question, which will come from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: One follow-up question and -- actually, 2 questions. So following up on US Oncology, we've heard earlier today some talk about oncology practices consolidating and gaining purchasing power. John, based on your earlier comments on the call, it sounds like McKesson is in a very good position to be a share taker. So can you take a little bit about how fast is the US Oncology physician base growing?
John H. Hammergren: Well, Ricky, I think what I should have said or meant to say is we're optimistic that our solution set is attractive to physicians. And whether they're existing physicians of ours that are aggregating together or whether they're physicians that don't use any of our services that are aggregating together, will be seen over time. I think our goal is not to gain share for share's sake. Our goal is to grow our business in a profitable way with customers that appreciate the value that we deliver. And we don't plan to compete in a way that doesn't take a holistic view, I guess, of what we have to deliver. And the customers that are interested in a US Oncology relationship with us are the more sophisticated customers that frankly have moved beyond their evaluation from simple distribution services to something much more significant. And so those are the customers that are usually open to that dialogue. I think that we will continue to see progress. Health care is a slow-moving world, and I don't think you're going to see sea changes, but I think, directionally, our view is that we're positively positioned.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then on your warehouse sales. Do you expect any impact to warehouse sales in the second half now that Walgreens and Express reached an agreement? Is the potential reversal in some of the share gains that we've seen earlier in the year?
John H. Hammergren: Well, we're a little distant from this, Ricky, in that these are questions our customers are probably better suited to answer. From a distance, I would say that there are probably some customers who will move back to their incumbent relationships with Walgreens. But there are probably some customers that have moved away from Walgreens, and they have found another store that is as convenient as where they were buying before. So I really don't feel I'm well-positioned to talk much about the share move. I would say that relative to our warehouse view, I don't think you'll see any material change to our warehouse sales as a result of anything that's going on in the industry.
Operator: And we'll move on to our next caller, which comes from Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Just a couple of quick ones. Generic, I was curious if we could get the impact on revenue in the quarter.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Do you mean, Eric, in terms of generic revenue growth?
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Well, I'd like to get the -- both actually, revenue growth for generics, if you will, and then also the impact on branded conversions.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: So for us, given our mix of customers and drugs, the interesting thing is if you look at the revenue decline due to branded drugs losing patent protection, it almost completely matched and was offset by the growth in generic revenues due to all the generic launches. So they were almost identical in size.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then the follow-up or the other quick question is, at the end of your prepared remarks, Jeff, you said something about $0.19 being additive to the number this year. I think I heard that, but the phone cut out, so I was just hoping you could refresh me on that.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Yes, so in the -- we have the unusual accounting around our acquisition of the remaining 50% of the headquarters building we've been in since the 1960s. And so that drives an $81 million gain. We're pulling it out of our adjusted earnings because it's acquisition related. And so that gain netted against a couple of cents of acquisition expenses means that you're going to -- as you do a reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP, you've got a $0.19 good guy that you add to the non-GAAP to get to the GAAP.
Operator: We will hear next from George Hill with Citi.
George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Jeff, you guys are doing well in the distribution part and the real estate investment part it seems. I'm going to ask a quick question though. Two follow-ups from the health care IT business. Maybe, John, could you give us an update on how the clinical conversions are going from the Horizon business to the Paragon business? And then maybe this one's a little weegee. Within the RelayHealth business, as we're starting to see e-prescribing come up the curve and utilization get pretty high, how should we think about the growth in Relay profitability going forward?
John H. Hammergren: The clinical conversions -- when we talked about our Horizon to Paragon strategy, we talked about the fact that we believe it is a viable solution for our customers, and that over time they need to evaluate that as an alternative because of its more tightly integrated infrastructure and its lower cost of operations. It also has some build out required to fully function in the way that all of our Horizon customers would require. So we've seen many of our Horizon base evaluate the products. We've seen some of that base already contract to move to Paragon, and some already have moved because of whatever remaining development is necessary and Paragon was not of import to those customers. Others have said, you know what, we're going to go, but we want you to build out another module or we're going to go after we get our Meaningful Use dollars settled and we have a bit of breather. And others frankly will probably wait until they have their Meaningful Use 2 or Meaningful Use 3 situation well in hand before they make that migration. So I think we've made good progress. I frankly am -- continue to be pleased with the reception our customer base has given to the Paragon solution. And frankly, taking it up a level, I think they're quite interested in the larger messages that McKesson has been delivering around our payer business and the need for the payer and provider solutions to come together, and also for our connectivity business. And I think the RelayHealth question is a good one. We are really pleased with our position in RelayHealth. I have to admit that the e-prescribing portion of the market's transition is not a particular profit driver for us. We're in that transaction both in our electronic medical record businesses as well as in Relay. But that's not really where the opportunity lies. The opportunity lies in the continued build out of our financial systems. As you know, we process well over $1 trillion in financial claims over our networks. Our Pharmacy Systems, which not only adjudicate pharmacy claims, but also helped us deliver more value to our customers through things like E-Voucher, where the manufacturers and the retailers work on behalf of the patient to provide better care and other offerings that RelayHealth is building out. Not the least of which is our new clinical information network or health information exchange. So I think we're pleased with our position on Relay. Electronic prescribing is a piece of it, but not the central driver financially.
Operator: We'll hear next from Steven Valiquette with UBS.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So this was somewhat addressed in a previous question. But in the health care IT we obviously have seen some choppy results from a few of your competitors. And I guess my question is maybe just to quickly remind us of a couple of drivers of the acceleration in the tech solutions profit growth you expect in the back half of the year. I'm just trying to revisit your own level of visibility on your business plan for FY '13 for tech solution in light of potentially changing market conditions. So are you sort of worried about this? Do you feel you can achieve your targets kind of regardless of market conditions? Just trying to get a general sense for that.
John H. Hammergren: I have to admit that I'm -- I would think there would be pretty good visibility in tech buying at this point. And if it's a surprise to anyone that clinical buying is beginning to wane, they must not be deep in the industry. We believe that our customers have largely made their clinical decisions. And what's great about McKesson's technology platform is we're actually in many businesses, as you're aware. We have 3 major lines of business there: our Relay connectivity business, our Payer businesses and clearly our Provider Technology business. But even inside our Provider Technology, in my prepared remarks I talked about over 1,000 customers installed in our analytics products. You know that we have a market-leading Medical Imaging business and some of our other lines that aren't just clinical transaction processing businesses for hospitals. And so I think that we see the clinical buying beginning to wane, has waned. We're in the implementation phase now. Actually if you look at our results under the cover, you actually will see that our hospital buyers are beginning to come back to purchasing other solutions beyond clinicals. And I think those companies that don't have a portfolio beyond clinicals are probably feeling the effect of a pipeline that is probably headed in a different direction. We are pleased with our performance. We think we have visibility to it through the rest of this fiscal year, and we believe that business will perform in line with our expectations. I think we've run out of time. I want to thank you, Anthony, and thanks to all of you on the call for your time today. I'm certainly pleased with our first quarter performance and excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for all of us. I will now hand the call off to Erin for her review of upcoming events for the financial community. Erin?
Erin Lampert: Thanks, John. I have a preview of upcoming events. On September 6, we will present at the Baird Health Care Conference in New York. On September 10, we will present at the Morgan Stanley Conference, also in New York. On November 15, we'll present at the Crédit Suisse Health Care Conference in Phoenix. We will release our second quarter earnings results in late October. We look forward to seeing you at one of these upcoming events. Thank you and have a great evening.
Operator: Again, we thank you for joining today's conference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Corporation Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Erin Lampert. Please go ahead.
Erin Lampert: Thank you, Elizabeth. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson's Fiscal 2012 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. With me today are John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and Jeff Campbell, our CFO. John will first provide a business update and will then introduce Jeff, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After Jeff's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time.  Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements.  Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results acquisition-related expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and certain litigation reserve adjustments. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for investors. Please refer to our press release announcing fourth quarter fiscal 2012 results available on our website for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thanks, and here is John Hammergren.
John H. Hammergren: Think, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. I'm really pleased to report the results from our last quarter of fiscal 2012, which wrapped up another strong full year of financial performance.  Our full year adjusted earnings per diluted share was $6.38, up 20% from the prior year. Fourth quarter revenues were up 10% to $31.7 billion and fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was up 17% to $2.09. We also had great performance in cash flow from operations, which came in at $2.9 billion for the year. This outstanding result is a tribute to our ability to efficiently manage working capital in a growing business. As a result of our cash flow performance and the overall strength of our balance sheet, in the fourth quarter we executed a $1.2 billion accelerated share repurchase program, bringing our total share repurchases for the year to $1.9 billion. Also in the fourth quarter, we completed our acquisition of the independent banner and franchise business of Katz Group Canada for $919 million. After completing the Katz acquisition and executing the accelerated share repurchase program, we still ended fiscal 2012 with over $3 billion in cash on our balance sheet, leaving strong flexibility to deploy capital using our portfolio approach going forward.  Turning to the broader industry environment. Health care topics remain a focus in this election year. We continue to believe the issues of quality, access and cost will remain at the center of all health care discussions. McKesson remains actively engaged in public policy conversations at the Federal and state level, addressing a number of issues that are important to our customers and, certainly, to our industry.  The issues our customers face remain the same regardless of the outcome of the ongoing political and legal discussions on health reform. Health care providers, manufacturers and payers are looking for broad solutions to drive improved financial, clinical and operational performance. With the most comprehensive set of tools, services and resources in our industry, McKesson is well-positioned to support our customers as the industry continues to transform.  Before I turn to the fourth quarter and full year results for Distribution Solutions, let me take a moment to walk you through a legal matter, which in the past has impacted our GAAP results in the Distribution Solutions segment. In our fiscal third quarter earnings call, Jeff indicated that we had reached an agreement in principle with the Department of Justice to resolve federal Medicaid claims related to AWP. I'm pleased to tell you that in April, we finalized this settlement, in line with our existing reserves. As you know, McKesson had previously settled all private payer AWP claims during the third quarter of fiscal 2009. While there are still outstanding cases by public entities, which we plan to vigorously defend, this settlement with the Department of Justice represents another important step in bringing resolution to the claims related to AWP.  Now moving on to some business results for our fourth quarter and full year. Strong execution in Distribution Solutions drove overall operating results for the company. We continue to grow and expand our value to our customers through our core capabilities of operational excellence, unmatched service levels, the global scale of our sourcing and the use of technology to help our customers succeed. U.S. Pharmaceutical continues to turn in outstanding results. Customers in all channels, from the small independent pharmacy to the large retail customer, recognize the value McKesson brings. As a result, we have succeeded along with our customers.  We've also performed well for our branded pharmaceutical manufacturing partners and maintained steady levels of compensation in return. A significant accomplishment for the U.S. Pharmaceutical business was being selected as a sole distributor for the Department of Veterans Affairs. I'm extremely pleased the VA has again trusted McKesson with serving our nation's veterans.  Finally, we had another significant quarter in generics, aided by 2 important product launches. Overall, generics continue to make a substantial contribution to our results.  In summary, I believe U.S. Pharmaceutical is extremely well-positioned for continued industry leadership.  Turning to our other businesses in Distribution Solutions segment. Our Canadian Distribution business had a solid year despite planned government-imposed price reductions for generic pharmaceuticals in certain provinces. Our team in Canada continues to find innovative ways to expand the breadth of their offering to our customers. And I'm pleased they were able to successfully mitigate much of the impact of ongoing regulatory challenges. We completed our acquisition of the independent banner and franchise business of the Katz Group Canada late in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, Katz has been a valued customer of McKesson for over 20 years so these banner and franchise members, who primarily operate under the brands of I.D.A., Guardian and Medicine Shoppe Canada, have long-standing relationships with McKesson. The response from the pharmacists has been positive, demonstrating McKesson's support to independent pharmacy and our capability to develop innovative and value-enhancing programs.  In our fourth quarter we recognized the one-year anniversary of our acquisition of US Oncology and our integration efforts are largely complete. US Oncology, part of McKesson's Specialty Health, provides one of the most comprehensive service offerings available to a large and fast growing segment in the health care industry. We have demonstrated the value of our expanded technology platform and broad sourcing capabilities that we bring to US Oncology physicians and hospitals. We remain focused on helping our customers succeed in an environment where they face increased reimbursement and competitive pressure.  During the fourth quarter, I named Marc Owen as the new President of McKesson Specialty Health. Many of you know Marc and he's led our strategy and business development efforts since 2001. Marc has a deep understanding of the health care industry, including the dynamics of the specialty market. I believe his leadership, along with our physician customers, will continue to shape a successful strategy for this important business.  Our Medical-Surgical business continues to contribute to the overall success of Distribution Solutions, with 8% growth in revenues in fiscal 2012. The fiscal 2012 results of our Medical-Surgical business extend a multi-year trend of strong execution and improved operating results. We continue our leadership in the ambulatory market by delivering value to our customers through our competitive offering, our strong focus on customer success and our private label products.  Overall, I'm extremely pleased with our full year performance in Distribution Solutions. As we look ahead to fiscal 2013, we expect that revenue in Distribution Solutions will grow at the market rate adjusted for our mix of business. We also expect continued growth in Distribution Solutions operating margins. Jeff will discuss our operating margin assumptions in more detail, but I'd like to highlight the key drivers of our expected margin expansion. We expect continued strong relationships with our branded pharmaceutical manufacturing partners where we deliver a broad range of value-added services, resulting in steady compensation. In fiscal 2013, we expect brand price inflation will be at levels similar to fiscal 2012. We also expect good progress with our proprietary generics programs in our global sourcing initiatives. As you know, we approach generics as a single company across all of our customer segments in U.S. Pharmaceutical, Canadian Distribution, and our specialty businesses. We are headed into a year with a robust oral generics launch calendar, and we expect generic price trends to be similar to those we experienced in fiscal 2012. I have tremendous confidence in the success of the Distribution Solutions segment. We have an excellent team throughout this business, and they have constantly and consistently demonstrated over many, many years, a commitment to delivering a significant value to our customers and strong financial results.  Turning now to Technology Solutions. For the year, Technology Solutions revenues were up 4% to $3.3 billion. Adjusted operating profit was up 21% to $440 million, including a product alignment charge, which I'll come back to in a moment. So overall, I'm pleased with the continued progress we are making in the Technology Solutions segment. As a reminder, in the third quarter, we announced a strategy in our hospital-facing business to converge core clinical and revenue cycle information technology solutions for the Horizon and Paragon product lines onto Paragon's Microsoft platform over time. Since then, we've met with all Horizon Clinical customers to discuss what our product strategy means for them. Keep in mind, we're not forcing migrations. We expect to have customers on the Horizon Clinicals platform for many years to come. And to successfully partner with those customers as certification requirements evolve. We have a long history of product innovation, including enabling our technology products to address regulatory requirements faced by our customers. Many of our Horizon Clinical customers are live on the currently certified release or in the process of upgrading. Horizon Clinical customers have previewed the Paragon product, many of them have, and the development roadmap vision we put in place, and they're pleased with what we have seen. Several Horizon Clinical customers have elected to convert to the Paragon product, and we started some of those conversions today. And we also have won new customers for Paragon. Our customers are pleased with the product as being contemporary, fully functional and easy to use and integrated.  In my own conversations with hospital customers, they agree our strategy is the right one going forward, despite the competitive noise in the marketplace. We believe our strategy puts customers in a better position to reach the clinical and financial end points they will need as reform and payment models evolve. The electronic medical record is an important building block of a provider's overall technology strategy. But it is other components, like performance management, analytics, care coordination and payor capabilities that will create the difference in our customers' ultimate success.  McKesson is the only company that delivers the breadth and depth of solutions to help our customers maximize the value of their core systems and improve quality and financial performance. Beyond our hospital-facing business, McKesson also continues to invest in solutions for our payer, pharmacy and physician customers.  Our RelayHealth business sits at the center of addressing customers' needs to better connect and coordinate care. RelayHealth customers can send electronic prescriptions, clinical reminder messages, electronic lab results and care summaries to patients. The proposed rules for Stage II Meaningful Use place an increasing emphasis on connectivity. RelayHealth's tools are already well-positioned to help providers and payers across the spectrum achieve these requirements, regardless of their underlying technology platform.  RelayHealth also helps facilitate the connectivity necessary for providers who are implementing new quality base care models. For example, the United States Department of Defense has implemented Relay Clinical secure messaging throughout its medical treatment facilities in all 3 branches of the military. This system allows health care providers to communicate with patients and other providers. McKesson Health Solutions is a leader in enabling players to use evidence-based clinical information technology to achieve better health care outcomes at lower cost.  I'll take a moment to highlight 2 products that directly support the payer, and their provider partnerships, that are so important in today's market. McKesson Health Solutions has paired InterQual, the leader in clinical decision-support criteria with Clear Coverage, a next-generation point of care decision-support tool. InterQual is used by over 70% of the top 25 health plans and over 2/3 of the hospitals in the United States. Together, these products are helping to promote consistent clinical decision-making that improves the efficient delivery of quality patient care.  Overall, I'm pleased to see the level of collaboration among our technology businesses to help our customers as they achieve better financial and clinical outcomes. Looking forward to fiscal 2013, we expect Technology Solutions revenue growth should be at the approximate level of growth experienced in fiscal 2012. And in summary, we are committed to helping our customers use information technology strategically to enable better business, better care and better connectivity.  Before I end, I will spend a moment talking about capital deployment. Over time, we used our portfolio approach to capital -- for capital deployment for acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and internal investments, creating significant value for our shareholders. We are in businesses that continue to generate strong cash flow from operations. We plan to continue our portfolio approach as we head into fiscal 2013. Our board recently authorized the repurchase of up to additional $700 million of our common stock, which brings the total remaining authorization to $1 billion. This action demonstrates our confidence in the business, and the stability of our future cash flows.  To wrap up my comments, I'm pleased with our financial results in fiscal 2012. I'm confident in our team's ability to deliver strong performance in fiscal 2013. We have a steady track record of delivering double-digit earnings growth, and I'm pleased to provide fiscal 2013 guidance where we expect to continue that trend. We expect fiscal 2013 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $7.05 to $7.35. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for a detailed review of our financial results. Jeff?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As you just heard, McKesson delivered another year of outstanding financial results. We had good growth in both segments, and our tremendous cash flows allowed us to continue our portfolio approach to capital deployment. This sets us up nicely for fiscal 2013, where we are pleased again to provide double-digit growth adjusted earnings per share guidance.  In my remarks today, I'll cover both the fourth quarter and full year results. As you know, we provide our guidance on an annual basis due to both the seasonality and the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations that are inherent in some of our businesses. In this context, an annual look at our financial results can provide more meaningful insight into some of the key trends. So I'll focus today more on the annual numbers than the quarterly ones, and I'll also comment on what these trends might mean for fiscal 2013. My comments today will also focus on our full year FY '12 adjusted EPS of $6.38, which as you recall, excludes 3 items: acquisition-related expenses; amortization of acquisition-related intangibles; and certain litigation reserve adjustments. The numbers I'll review in my discussion today will all be based on an adjusted earnings basis and can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 included in today's press release.  One other quick reminder. We fully lapped the US Oncology acquisition as of the end of the third quarter.  Let me now begin with our consolidated results, which can be found on Schedules 2A and 2B. For the full year, consolidated revenues increased 10% to $123 billion versus $112 billion a year ago. Excluding the impact of US Oncology, total revenues increased approximately 7% for the full year, with both segments contributing nicely to this result. Total gross profit was up 10% for the year on the 10% increase in overall revenues. Although we did see a little bit of gross margin improvement in both segments. Total operating expenses for the full year were up 8% to $4.1 billion. Our full year operating expenses were higher primarily due to the US Oncology acquisition. As an aside, excluding the impact of US Oncology, full year operating expenses were up roughly 4% year-over-year, in line with our expectations.  Moving down the P&L. Other income was fairly flat for the full year at $21 million. Full year interest expense increased $54 million to $251 million primarily due to the debt we've put in place as a result of the US Oncology acquisition.  Turning now to taxes. As of the end of the third quarter, our full year estimate of the tax rate was 32%. In the fourth quarter, however, we recognized some favorable tax discrete items, which drove our full year tax rate down to 30%. Looking forward, our fiscal 2013 outlook assumes an adjusted tax rate of 31%, which creates a modest headwind for next year.  Net income for the full year was $1.6 billion and our earnings per diluted share was $6.38. To wrap up our consolidated results, this year's earnings per share number was aided by the cumulative impact of our share repurchases, which lowered our full-year diluted weighted average shares outstanding by 5% year-over-year to $251 million. We were pleased that our board recently increased our share repurchase authorization to a total of $1 billion. While we don't comment on the timing or amount of future share repurchases, we do give guidance on our weighted average diluted shares outstanding assumption, which for fiscal 2013 is 239 million.  Let's now turn to the segment results, which can be found on Schedules 3A and 3B. In Distribution Solutions, total revenues increased 10% for the full year and also 10% for the quarter. Direct distribution and services and sales to customers' warehouses revenues were both up 10% for the year. Full year direct revenues reflect the favorable impact of market growth and the US Oncology acquisition. Warehouse revenues, as we have discussed over the past several quarters, increased primarily due to a new customer. To focus for a second on just the fourth quarter results, we did see particularly strong revenues in both the direct and warehouse lines, primarily due to an increase in volume with several of our largest existing customers.  Looking ahead, given the record number of expected generic launches in our fiscal 2013, we anticipate direct revenues will be fairly flat and possibly even down a bit next fiscal year. Since our economics are better on generic drugs, this is, of course, a good thing for our customers and the company.  Shifting to warehouse revenues in fiscal 2013, we do expect unusually strong double-digit growth in our warehouse line, primarily due to expanded volumes with existing customers. I would remind you, of course, that the impact on our earnings of higher warehouse revenues is quite modest, as we earn lower margin on our warehouse revenues relative to the margin on our direct revenues.  Moving back now to fiscal 2012. Canadian revenues on a constant currency basis increased 3% for the full year and 13% for the quarter. Both the full year and quarter benefited from having 5 extra sales days in the quarter. When you exclude these 5 days, Canadian revenues on a constant currency basis were up 1% for the full year. Given the ongoing generic price reduction challenges we face, we're fairly pleased with the 1% full year growth and expect similar flat to low levels of growth in fiscal 2013.  Medical-Surgical revenues were up 8% for both the full year and the quarter, primarily driven by market growth and new customers. Gross profit for the segment increased 11% for the full year. Excluding the impact of the US Oncology acquisition, gross profit would be up approximately 5% for the full year. Distribution Solutions operating expense increased 9% for the full year, primarily due to the US Oncology acquisition. Once we've finished lapping the US Oncology acquisition, you saw our fourth quarter operating expense increase just 3% versus the prior year. For the full year, operating profit grew 13% to $2.5 billion, and we ended the year with an operating margin rate of 210 basis points. This is up 6 basis points year-over-year, and reflects a nice, steady, upward movement within our 200 to 250 basis point target range.  Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were up 4% for the full year to $3.3 billion, and full year operating profit was up 21% to $440 million. And as noted on Schedule 3B, our full year operating margin rate was 13.29%. Focusing on just the fourth quarter, you did see our revenues down 2% to $860 million and operating profit was down 20% for the quarter. I'd remind you that in fiscal 2011, our financial results were heavily skewed towards the March quarter due to several product GAs and certifications that occurred in last year's fourth quarter. This created some lapping challenges in our Technology segment in the March quarter, compared to the same March quarter in fiscal 2011.  Operating expenses in this segment increased 3% for the full year, and we're pleased with the team's ability to control expense growth. Despite this focus on controlling costs, as another example of our commitment to our customer success, we continue to invest across all our technology businesses. Technology Solutions gross R&D spending for the year was $451 million, up 3% compared to $436 million in the prior year. Of these amounts, we capitalized 8% compared to 12% a year ago.  Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. We were pleased to see our cash flow from operations come in at $2.9 billion for the year. This is an outstanding result, and well above our original expectations. I view it as a great commentary on the businesses we are in and on the efforts of our management teams to continually find ways to more efficiently manage the business. For us as a company to grow our revenues 10%, adjusted earnings per share 20% and yet reduce our working capital by almost $0.5 billion is an outstanding result. This is reflected in our working capital metrics where our days sales outstanding decreased to 24 days from 25 days last year. Our days sales in inventory decreased by one day to 30 days, while our days sales in payables increased 2 days from a year ago, to 49 days. Looking ahead, we expect cash flow from operations to be between $2 billion and $2.5 billion in fiscal 2013.  Overall, our gross debt to capital ratio was 36.8% at year end, leaving us right in the middle of our target range. Internal capital spending was $403 million for the year, slightly below our original expectations. You will see our fiscal 2013 guidance assumes an internal capital spending range between $425 million and $475 million.  Moving now to provide some additional context for our fiscal 2013 adjusted earnings guidance of $7.05 to $7.35 per diluted share. John has already talked about our key -- he's already talked about our key business objectives and in our press release today, you will find a list of key assumptions underlying this guidance. So I won't go over these again here, but I would like to add a few points of additional color.  I mentioned earlier that our fiscal 2012 operating margin in Distribution Solutions was 210 basis points. We expect improvement to this operating margin in the mid to high single-digit basis points. In Technology Solutions, we expect to get margin expansion of our fiscal 2012 operating margin rate of 13.29%, though we expect to still be within the low end of our long-term operating margin goal range of mid-teens.  Turning to the quarterly progression. We expect the fiscal 2013 Technology Solutions results to be heavily weighted towards the back half, similar to fiscal 2011 results. Key products GAs in the back half of fiscal 2013 are the primary drivers of this expected result, just as we had key product GAs in the back half of fiscal 2011. To speak more broadly about our quarterly earnings per share progression, as you know, we do not provide quarterly EPS guidance due to the variability in the timing of certain items in our business. Over the course of a full year, these factors tend to even out. But within the year, they can create challenges when comparing year-over-year results on a quarterly basis. To remind you of a few of these factors, first, in Distribution Solutions, as we've talked about today, we anticipate a record number of oral generic launches in fiscal 2013. This unprecedented level of launches certainly has the potential to create some quarterly fluctuations, but it is important to think about this relative to all of the other factors that also influence our quarterly results. For example, also in Distribution Solutions, although our agreements with branded manufacturers provide a steady level of predictability for compensation, the structures of many agreements use price increases as the determinant of compensation timing, which we can't always foresee accurately quarter-to-quarter. In addition, in Technology Solutions, as I discussed earlier, the anticipated timing of various product releases and GAs next fiscal year will cause results in the segment to be back-half loaded.  Last, as for all companies, tax is another area where we see quarterly fluctuations. While these adjustments may change our tax rate from quarter-to-quarter, in fiscal 2012, for example, we ranged from 27% to 32%. We believe that our annual tax rate is a better overall measure of our tax expense. Just to remind you, as I said earlier, our estimated adjusted tax rate for fiscal 2013 is 31%. So with all that being said, sitting here today as we look at our plans, when measured as a percentage of our annual earnings per share, we would expect the first quarter to be roughly similar to our experience in the fiscal 2012 first quarter. And again this year, our earnings per share will be weighted towards the back-half, and the fourth quarter will be exceptionally strong.  With respect to our recent acquisition of the Katz Group assets, we are expecting accretion of approximately $0.15 on an adjusted earnings basis for fiscal 2013, and this accretion will be spread fairly evenly across all 4 quarters.  Now let me briefly mention one last item that will impact our first quarter fiscal 2013 GAAP results. When you read the 10-K, you will see a subsequent events footnote pointing out that earlier this month, in April, we completed a business combination in which we acquired the remaining interest in our corporate headquarters build. The way accounting rules in this area work, this creates a pretax acquisition-related gain of approximately $75 million. Similar to how we treat other one-time acquisition-related items, this transaction will be excluded from our adjusted earnings results.  To conclude, our fourth quarter results wrapped up another year of strong double-digit adjusted earnings growth, and we've laid a good foundation as we head into fiscal 2013. Thanks and with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question today from Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: I guess, first one, just on the quarter to follow up on some of your comments and your remarks. You said that direct revenue growth, direct customer revenue growth was stronger due to the growth of some of your customers, can I assume that those were bigger customers that were probably a little bit of a lower margin?
John H. Hammergren: Yes, that's a fair assumption, Tom. It is -- there's been some moving parts in the industry that have caused some of our larger customers to grow a little more rapidly than otherwise, and I think that's what's reflected in those numbers.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then just thinking about the outlook. You guys mentioned some of the headwinds and tailwinds in quarterly ups and downs throughout the year. Can you just comment maybe at a high level, your thoughts on generics, and how that may affect the quarterly progression?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, as I said, Tom, while generics are an important driver for us in FY '13 given the unprecedented year in oral generics as we've also talked about of course, it's a down year for specialty generics. I'd really come back to the fact that there's other items that are just as big driving some quarterly volatility. So the guidance I gave at the end there for the effect on EPS by quarter, where in particular for the June quarter as a percentage of our total year's earnings, we'd expect it to look actually pretty similar to last year, and it will -- the results will again be back-half loaded, pretty similar to last year. So a lot of the differences in the oral generic launch calendar are getting offset by some of the other timing differences we see year-over-year.
Operator: We'll take the next question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Jeff, just as we look at bulk versus direct store deliveries, can you just remind us of, on a relative magnitude, the difference in the margins between the 2? And as we think about that next year, do you expect these increases in volumes to continue with these customers, or is this more related to the Walgreens-Express scripts dispute?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, while the Walgreens-Express dispute certainly drove some traffic everywhere else in the industry and many of our customers benefited from that and therefore, us. The increase, Lisa, in the warehouse revenues is really driven by the small handful of customers for whom we do warehouse business. I'd remind you that we only do warehouse business as part of a broader surface -- service offering to these customers where we do lots of direct store delivery. The warehouse revenues themselves are at a very low margin, which we don't disclose, but are an important part of the broader service offering to these customers. When you look at 2013, because the increase is more importantly, driven by some of the new business that our customers have won, we would actually expect double-digit growth in the warehouse revenue line in 2013.
John H. Hammergren: And, Lisa, you might recall there's a large -- there was a large contract that changed hands between one of our competitor's customers and one of our customers. And as a result, our warehouse revenue for the next 3 quarters at a minimum will be growing nicely as a result. To Jeff's point though, it does come at a low margin, puts a little pressure on us from a mix perspective in terms of driving our margin rate up. But we did guide to a margin rate increase for the year, in basis points we talked about earlier. So even with that pressure I think we can still get good leverage in our business, and we're pleased that our customers are winning, and we get to reflect that through our revenue as well.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then John, just as a follow-up. VA -- obviously congratulations on keeping that contract, can you comment at all if anything has changed within the contractual relationship? Obviously that the pricing was public, but how should we think that -- about that in context to some of your other customers, number one. And number two, are there any new services that you'll be providing to VA that you didn't previously provide in this new contract?
John H. Hammergren: Well, as we said earlier we are really pleased that we were able to win that award, and renew that relationship, and we're very happy about that. The contract itself has some nuances associated with it, but I think it largely is similar to the contract we had before. As it relates to other customers though, this customer is unique in its approach and the contract reflects its uniqueness in terms of the way it buys and the way it behaves, and so we had an eight-year run understanding how the VA contract worked for us and clearly that gives -- gave us good insight as we put our proposal in and fortunately allowed us to win that award. We don't believe other customers have any confusion about the uniqueness of the VA, and so we're hopeful that we'll continue to move forward with them like we have in the past as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Hey Jeff, can you make -- can you give us a comment, the accounts receivable up even with the IT business winding down a little bit on the software side, any comment there. And then secondarily, on the share base, I can't get to your fiscal '13 guidance without a much bigger buyback, so I'm wondering just what the ASR did for you in the fourth quarter. Would you have, maybe a balance sheet share base outstanding at the end of the fourth quarter?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, let me walk backwards on those. You're correct that in March we did a $1.2 billion ASR, and while the ultimate final timing or average price will be determined over the next few months. In effect, an estimate based on the then market price of how many shares we will ultimately get comes out of the share count right away. So when you see our 10-K in another day or so, you'll see that the March 31 share count, or I guess the mid-April share count for the 10-K, was about 235 million shares, because it reflects a very large reduction. I think once you plug that in you'll get right to our weighted average sales assumption. On receivables, I guess, I'd come back to it. Remember, we had a lot of growth in sales, so from a pure DSO perspective, you actually see our DSOs declining year-over-year from 25 to 24. And as always, that's really just driven more by customer mix than anything else, because it's really our U.S. Pharma business, it's the only one that's big enough to have much of an impact on that AR line, and we're actually pleased with that progress.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. But nothing from Katz, or nothing from aging on that front?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: No, the Katz transaction, while they did -- do appear in the balance sheet on March 31, there's no P&L results because we closed right at the end of March. The assets and liabilities they added are certainly not material at the AR line.
Operator: We'll take the next question from Larry Marsh with Barclays.
Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just a couple of question follow-up. I guess for the record, John, there's obviously another RFP up for bid, Express Scripts has announced they've issued the RFP. I would assume you would have an interest. Can you confirm that? And if so, if you do win that, how would you balance servicing that customer with your other larger mail-order customers?
John H. Hammergren: We are aware of the activity at Express Scripts. We typically don't talk about the activities of our existing customers, let alone the activities of other people's customers or potential customers. So I hesitate to comment on the Express Scripts opportunity other than to say that clearly, they're a large -- a large player in the industry now and will certainly command the interest of players in the industry, and I know that this will be sort of another mini VA question for people, but there's a time line to get it resolved. I think that from a service perspective, McKesson stands in a position where we are able to service customers and accomplish their requirements, both from a capacity perspective, but probably as important, in terms of the value we bring to our discussions with our customers, and that's what we try to focus the opportunity. Sometimes customers are open to those discussions and sometimes they're not. And clearly our team will have to reflect on that as they think about this opportunity going forward.
Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, great. And as a follow-up, another, I guess, a timely question for you, John, just the Chairman of the largest overseas pharmaceutical supply chain company quoted today suggesting a real need for them to expand or [ph] partner in the U.S. Can you remind us of how you're viewing your expansion in the global footprint, given you're the largest supply chain company in the world already, and what would be important factors in your mind of positives and negatives of potentially expanding the acquisition globally?
John H. Hammergren: Well I didn't see the quote, I can guess as to where it came from. The -- that same person probably also has a vertical opportunity in terms of retailing. So it's difficult to say necessarily where they may end up or go. Clearly, we have a North American footprint in Distribution today that we're very proud of, and we've performed very well in those markets. As it relates to international expansion, there are clearly some synergies that exist relative to product sourcing perhaps, and that may exist in terms of bringing best practices between various countries or markets, and we've done some of that clearly here between Canada, in particular, and the U.S. and we've taken a one McKesson approach into Canada, bringing other products and services there even outside of Distribution, because that footprint or platform gives us an opportunity to expand. And clearly that same argument could be made for other markets. That's the bull case for doing those kinds of things. The bear case, you'd have to think about growth rates in other markets. You have to think about the cost to buy into other markets or the greenfield in other markets and return on capital, and we are very focused on getting cash returns that are exceeding our cost of capital. We do think cash flow is very important, and we do think that you have to pay the right price or it doesn't matter how strategic a potential acquisition would be. And then so growth rates, what you have to pay, what synergies do you bring and then lastly, what are the characteristics of those markets. Are you -- as you've witnessed recently in other headlines, there are dangers in going off the American shores and participating in markets where business practices might be at minimum unfamiliar to us and at maximum, potentially hazardous to us. And I think that McKesson's very aware of those challenges and has to remain diligent and visual [ph] and remain focused on not poisoning ourselves through an acquisition that doesn't make sense in that characteristic. So we remain open, but albeit skeptical on some of this and we'll see how it plays out.
Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Yes, very good. You got the person right, it was just a blub on the Financial Times, FYI.
Operator: We'll hear next from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Jeff, just wanted to go back to the favorable tax discrete items in the quarter, and I was just curious if you could maybe share with us when you might have had visibility to that benefit. If I look at the other side, the operating expense side, costs are a little bit ahead of our model in the quarter. Just curious if there was anything pulled forward, relative to that benefit that you might have known was coming.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, maybe to answer your question just slightly more broadly, Robert, there's really 3 things that drive our tax rate. One is the mix of business which didn't -- international versus U.S. didn't really surprise us and, frankly, it's pretty similar next year. Two is tax law is always changing, the R&E credit's going away, for example, again, which is one of the things driving our tax rate up a little bit next year. And third, they're always truing up to actual tax returns, settling -- small settlements with states and foreign governments, and sometimes those are positives and sometimes they're negative, and they're pretty hard to predict. So we had a couple of positives in the March quarter that we really didn't have that much visibility too, until the March quarter. While we knew the disputes were out there, you never really know when and exactly how you're going to settle them until you get there.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then if I could just, on my follow-up, slide in one on Technology Solutions. Sales and profit there, at least relative to our model were a little bit below expectations. Since making the decision around the Horizon suite of products, is there, I know you guys touched on this in your prepared remarks, but has there any meaningful customer pushback, and I guess how are you factoring in shifting clinical customers from Horizon to Paragon in the fiscal '13 guidance?
John H. Hammergren: Well, at a high-level, the customers that we've -- that I've met with personally, I'll speak first-hand, have been very open to the discussion around, providing a product that's fully integrated, provide a product that is easier to implement and easier to manage and own over time, and one that is more prepared for the future where connectivity to payers and connectivity to consumers and dealing with a bundled pace -- bundled base pricing, those kinds of things. That they understand what -- where we need to be in the next 10 years and they're focused on getting there. Having said that, they're also very focused on getting their products installed and operating and getting their Meaningful Use dollars brought in. And that's, I think, the beauty of the strategy that we announced. We are not sunsetting the Horizon product line, and we have told our customers that the Horizon Clinical product line will be invested in through the Meaningful Use cycles in getting them to where they need to be from a regulatory perspective, to receive full access to the funds. Should they choose to go to Paragon, we want to position Paragon as a go-to platform for them, and that's really been the context of the discussion. As it relates to the fiscal '13 guidance, clearly there are some revenue recognition challenges that we've mentioned in the GA discussion that Jeff had, relative to the strong last half, in fact, strong fourth quarter to be more specific relative to this business. And so as we think about our customers' success, frankly, we're investing towards their success and less focused on near-term revenue rec issues and more focused on how do we make sure that they're getting the products they need, that we're investing against those products and that they're happy customers of McKesson. There'll be a little chance to have a discussion with them about their go-forward platform if we fail them on their near-term expectations, so our focus is to invest heavily to get them to where they need to be.
Operator: Your next question will come from Steven Valiquette from UBS.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So just a, I guess there was a comment this morning from a generic manufacturer on their conference call where they talked about the pricing on a large generic statin drug may be declining by about 96% from their -- the original brand price once you get beyond the exclusivity here in a month or 2. That could be surprising to some, not to others. I guess my general question is, since you guys hate talking about individual products. I'm just wondering whether the profitability on that, in particular large generic post-exclusivity, whether or not that's a big swing factor within your renewed guidance of $7.05 to $7.35. Or have you just taken a conservative stance in general on that product, just given its size?
John H. Hammergren: Yes, I think our -- the answer on that particular product is we've -- we planned it appropriately and conservatively, and I think it's performing the way we had expected it to, and it is frankly -- will perform based on other expert thoughts where we think it will be. So we are, as I've said in the past, we sometimes are wrong in individual molecules, not very wrong usually, but sometimes wrong and maybe timing, maybe pricing, but generally speaking, the portfolio is right. And on these bigger drugs, we're probably even more accurate, because of the import to our company, and I think we are -- are where we expected to be.
Operator: We'll take the next question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just one -- a couple clarifications around guidance and one generic question. So Jeff, I think you mentioned that the June quarter, right, the implied guidance is similar to the first fiscal quarter of 2012. So just to confirm, this is as a percent of earnings, right? Not in absolute terms.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Correct, so as a percentage of earnings.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. So and is 20% -- is the right percentage? I just took the $1.27 over what you've done for the year?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: I would literally, Ricky, just go back and look at the FY '12 June quarter EPS and divide it by $6.38 and that's kind of the ballpark we're in here.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then for the -- talking about fiscal year '13 being back-end loaded, so is the operating margin improvement year-over-year is also back-end loaded, especially skewed to the fourth quarter, is that how we should think about it?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, I guess I'm not sure we're giving operating margin guidance, Ricky, by quarter. I'd really just focus on the EPS and the drivers of the performance are going to vary each quarter as generics go in and out, as price increases, timing, various tax varies -- that's just the level of granularity we don't give guidance on. We feel very comfortable with the guidance for the full year of Distribution Solutions operating margin rate being up in the mid to high single digits.
John H. Hammergren: I think it probably is fair, Ricky, that the margin variation you've seen in previous quarters and years is, in some way, an indicator, at least graphically, of what you might expect. I wouldn't focus, as Jeff said, so much of the numbers, but you're going to see that kind of variability like you always do.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then on the generic side, can you just give us, I know you said that you saw very good growth in generics, what was the growth of generic in the quarter? And also Jeff said [ph] we had a reference point for the -- you talked about branded and generic pricing trends for next year, similar to this year, so if you can give us the context, what they were this year?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, on the price trends, to be very clear here, everybody measures price trends for both brand and generic a little differently. What we've stated in our guidance is that by whatever measurement you want to use, we're assuming that our fiscal year '13 looks similar to fiscal year '12, not better, but not worse, either. So you, we have our own metrics we use internally, but you can almost use whichever ones you want.
John H. Hammergren: And on the generic question, Ricky, I think our generic growth was in line with what we had expected and in line with where the market is. We've gotten -- we continue to get a little bit of increased penetration in our existing customer base but clearly we continue to focus on making sure that we do the right job in terms of sourcing these products as well.
Operator: We'll take the next question from George Hill with Citi.
George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just a couple of housekeeping questions. Jeff, first of all, corporate expenses, a little higher than I'd modeled, was there anything, any standout items in that line this quarter?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Short answer is no. That line jumps around -- it was just due to timing differences from year-to-year. If you look at next year's plan, for example, our plan actually shows for the year the number flattish, so I wouldn't read anything into that quarterly trend. It's really just timing.
George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then I'll give -- lob one to Jeff and one to John. Jeff, any change given how much time you guys spent talking about the health car (sic) [care] key segment that you would give us a rough overview of how much of that segment is exposed to providers, how much is exposed to payers, how much is exposed to other. And then, John, Mark has been your right-hand man on the M&A side for a long time now. With Marc moving over to the specialty business, should we have any takeaways for how the company thinks about M&A with Marc doing something else?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, let me -- I'll just quickly do the break out. So what we've said, George, is when you look at our Technology segment, which is by far the broadest collection of technology businesses in health care, you've got at this point under half the profits that come from the hospital-facing portion of that business. And you've got 2 other big chunks of that business, one is the relay connectivity business which is a very, very steady transaction processing based business and then the third component is the payer-facing business, really built around 2 tremendous product lines and franchises in InterQual, and our claims extend network.
John H. Hammergren: And before I answer the question on Marc, George, I might also point out in the hospital-facing businesses, we sometimes focus heavily on Horizon Clinicals and this Paragon discussion, even in that business we have a very strong and rapidly growing analytics business that wraps around anybody's core electronic medical record, we have a very large Medical Imaging business, you might recall that we were one of the leaders in PACS systems being installed. Our automation business is also in that hospital number that -- a reference that Jeff just made. So there are lots of pieces there that are very important to us that frankly, can rise and fall on their own performance, based on innovation and how they go to market. As it relates to Marc Owen, what's great about this team, having been together for over a decade for most of us, including Marc, there is a complete alignment around strategy and a complete alignment around capital allocation and around returns in a way we approach M&A and strategy and business development. Having said that, he's not easy to replace, and so we hope to look for someone that will bring his tremendous attributes and intellect to the party. But he's going to do a great job for us in the specialty business. As you might imagine, managing the physician space, in particular, in specialty health is extremely important. And strategically, the opportunities that are present for us in that business are quite significant. And so it's nice to have a resource that we know and we trust at the helm there that also has those skills and leadership capability. So we're delighted to have Mark assume that role and head off to Houston.
Operator: We will go next to Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I have a 2-part question so I'll ask the first part and then follow up. The first part is that, while and I think most others probably under-modeled the warehouse sales in the quarter, which would explain the mix impact on margin, did you see any likelihood of a $5.5 billion quarter in that segment or were you surprised by the magnitude?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Yes, I think we were surprised by the strength of the warehouse sales, and pleasantly surprised. And that's part of why the -- for the year the operating margin in Distribution Solutions might have been a basis point or so below where we thought, mainly because revenues were higher.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Right, yes, I can get to that math do and I guess that is the follow-up. It's were there any other items that you'd care to talk about that impacted your margin, whether it be generics, which we've hit on today or LIFO customer contract changes, losses, et cetera, was there anything else in there that had an influence that we should be aware of?
John H. Hammergren: No, I don't think so. I just -- I think you should think about the fastest-growing drivers of both revenue in the warehouse as well as direct revenues. Growth in customers that exist and in large customers that exists, so it probably was a little bit of mix pressure, both from the warehouse but also from the people in direct, that might have been benefiting from some of the industry challenges that were going on in those big metropolitan markets where you have lots of chains competing with each other. Those chains that were our customers that might have won business would have been lower margin, typically, than the independent stores or other people in our base. So I think that mixing works through both of those revenue lines. But we're still pleased, obviously with the margin performance in the business, and if you actually look underlying the covers, you take that revenue and normalize it a little bit, we're making the kind of progress we expect it to.
Operator: And that's all the time we have today for questions. I'll turn the call back over to Erin Lampert for any closing comments.
John H. Hammergren: Well, I'm going to close up here, and I'll give it to Erin in just a moment. I want to thank all of you for being on the call today. We had a strong finish to our fiscal year. Our expectations for a solid performance in going into 2013 are certainly here, and our opportunity to continue to deploy capital in an appropriate way and in a portfolio way will allow us to continue, I think, to drive value for our customers and strong financial returns for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Erin.
Erin Lampert: Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events for the financial community. We'll participate in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Health Care Conference in Las Vegas on May 15, and the Goldman Sachs health care conference in Rancho Palos Verdes on June 5. We'll release first quarter earnings results in late July. We look forward to seeing you at one of these upcoming events. Thank you, and goodbye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the McKesson Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded, and if you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Ana Schrank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Ana Schrank: Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2012 Third Quarter Earnings Call. With me today are John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and Jeff Campbell, our CFO. John will first provide a business update, and will then introduce Jeff who will review the financial results for the quarter. After Jeff's comments, we'll open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 6:00 Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results acquisition-related expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and certain litigation reserve adjustments. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for investors. Please refer to our press release announcing third quarter fiscal 2012 results available on our website for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results.  Thanks, and here is John Hammergren.
John H. Hammergren: Thanks, Anna, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. I'm pleased with our business performance for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 and with our announced agreement to purchase the independent banner and franchise businesses of the Katz Group Canada. For those of you unfamiliar with Katz Group Canada, it is a privately owned company that operates an integrated retail pharmacy network in Canada. Katz is a long-time valued McKesson customer, and we are excited about this transaction. I will talk about the acquisition in more detail later in the call. For our third quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $30.8 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.40. Our results were solid for the company as a whole, particularly for Distribution Solutions, which was helped by our acquisition of US Oncology.  Based on our year-to-date performance, we are maintaining our guidance range and expect adjusted earnings between $6.19 and $6.39 per diluted share for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012.  Before I turn the call over to Jeff for a detailed review of our financial results, I will provide some highlights from both segments of our business.  Within our Distribution Solutions segment, our U.S. Pharmaceutical business led the way with another strong revenue result and solid expense control, which contributed nicely to the segment's growth. We continue to benefit from our long-standing relationships with branded manufacturers, delivering great value to them and earning steady levels of compensation in return. Generics play an ever more significant role in U.S. Pharmaceutical. In the third quarter, one of the important launches was for the generic version of LIPITOR. Thus far, the launch has been tracking nicely, and we expect it to meet our original full year expectations. We've also been pleased with the relative price stability within the broader generics market, which is in line with our original forecast. In our Specialty Health business, we hit the one-year anniversary of our acquisition of U.S. Oncology. Our focus is shifted from the integration of the 2 companies to now we are operating the business combined in delivering an expanded value proposition to our market. We have a broad diverse specialty business with solutions not only for oncology but for a number of complex disease states.  In addition, we have the innovative practice management and clinical support solutions that came to us to the US Oncology acquisition and a world-class vaccine distribution business and a leading risk mitigation set of programs. These collective capabilities will help hospitals, community oncologists and other multi-specialty providers improve the integrated care experience for patients and drive business and clinical innovation. Finally, for both the third quarter and year-to-date, generics played an important role in specialty performance, but as certain molecules progress in our life cycle, that contribution will moderate going forward.  Our Medical-Surgical revenues grew 2% in the quarter, reflecting steady market growth, partially offset by the fact that we experienced the majority of our sales of flu vaccine in the second quarter instead of the third quarter.  We remain focused on delivering value to our Medical-Surgical customers by optimizing our sourcing of McKesson brand where we deliver high-quality private label products at great savings. In addition, we continue to drive leverage through aggressive cost management. Turning now to our Canadian business. We announced today our intent to acquire the independent banner and franchise businesses of Katz Group for approximately CAD $920 million. We expect this acquisition will close in the first half of calendar 2012. This transaction is of strategic value to us, and financially, it will generate a nice return in excess of our hurdle rates.  On an adjusted earnings basis, the acquisition is expected to be neutral to McKesson's earnings in our current fiscal year and approximately $0.10 to $0.20 accretive in the first fiscal year after closing.  In addition to the acquisition, we will also continue to serve as the primary pharmaceutical distributor to the Katz corporate-owned stores. We believe this transaction is a good fit with our long-term objectives in Canada and supports our business strategy of expanding our retail and distribution presence in Canada and growing our sales of higher margin products and services.  McKesson Canada has a long history of supporting independent pharmacies through our banner offering, our retail automation solutions and our specialty offering. The addition of the banner and franchise operations of Katz reinforces our ongoing commitment to the independent segment.  McKesson Canada currently operates a number of banner groups including Proxim, Associated Retail Pharmacy and Family Health Care Pharmacy. The new banner groups that we intend to acquire from Katz will be operated in a manner similar to the 3 existing banners, which means member pharmacies will remain owners of their pharmacies and will be responsible for the management of their business while benefiting from McKesson's expertise and wide range of solutions.  Banners in Canada provide a broad range of services to their members, which results in the banner itself generating profits through purchasing, marketing and adherence programs. We have been developing our operating in this area for the past few years with the acquisition of Proxim in 2008, as an example.  According to a survey conducted in one of Québec's leading business magazines, Proxim ranks #1 for customer experience compared to other pharmacies in the province. Due to the scale of this transaction, their offering to the value-added services to all of our banner customers will be enhanced. We built a recognized brand in Canada with strong positions in every market segment and close customer relationships. We believe this acquisition allows us to maintain a leadership position in the market. This transaction will allow us to leverage the strengths of our complementary businesses, such as specialty and automation with the Drug Trading and Medicine Shoppe Canada customer base. Turning now to our results in our existing Canadian business. Coming into our fiscal year, we talked about the challenges we would face due to the effect of public policy-related price reductions on generic drugs. Over the course of the year, our Canadian team has worked to offset the impact of the price reductions. We focused on generic compliance gains with customers, expense control measures and capitalizing in global sourcing and branded generic pharmaceuticals. I'm pleased to say that these mitigation efforts have been very successful. To sum up. In Distribution Solutions, we had a good third quarter performance, resulted from our terrific combination of assets, and I have confidence in our full year performance. Turning now to Technology Solutions. In the December quarter, we announced a series of product strategy changes in our hospital business to converge our core clinical and revenue cycle solutions. And in conjunction, we announced that we would stop development of one of our revenue cycle management products, Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management.  As a result of this decision, our third quarter results included a pretax charge of $42 million. Excluding the charge, I'm pleased with our performance across the segment. The businesses that make up Technology Solutions performed well this quarter, resulting in strong revenue growth and adjusted operating margin enhancement.  With customers in virtually every healthcare segment, McKesson has a unique view of the healthcare industry. Over the past couple of years, with the introduction of Meaningful Use and the drive toward universal health IT adoption, the needs of the market and our customers have changed.  A top near-term priority for our hospital and health system partners is managing the increase regulatory complexity. We are committed to getting our customers through Meaningful Use 2 and 3, and ensuring our solutions comply with HIPAA 5010 and ICD-10. Our customers also need a path to the future as they assume greater risk, coordinate care, manage populations and collaborate with payers and others in the community. Through the strategic use of information technology, McKesson can provide our customers with a broad perspective on what it takes to solve complex issues that they face.  Across all of our technology businesses, we are continuing to invest significant R&D dollars to develop solutions that address the needs of our customers, both today and as healthcare reform unfolds.  Over time, we plan to converge our core clinical and revenue cycle health IT capabilities for the Horizon and Paragon product lines onto Paragon's Microsoft platform. Paragon is an integrated core clinical and revenue cycle suite built from the ground up over the past 12 years. With a single database that then becomes a complete clinical and financial repository. We are confident we can continue to serve our customers well with an integrated core clinical and revenue cycle solution as their foundation, complemented by our broader set of assets. With our payer-facing health solutions business and our RelayHealth Connectivity business, we can connect our hospital and health system partners to their communities, helping them align with physicians, coordinate care, create patient-centered medical homes and form relationships with payers and others.  This quarter we made good progress in our Provider Technology businesses with implementations of both of our Horizon and Paragon systems, and I'm pleased with how the implementations have rolled out during the quarter. In addition, our Transaction Processing business continues to steady - continues its steady performance. Overall, I'm pleased with our progress in Technology Solutions, and I'm confident we have the right set of assets. As the largest healthcare services and technology company, McKesson is committed to working with all participants in healthcare to develop innovations that lead to healthcare systems that are simultaneously high-performing, accessible and economically sustainable. In summary, I'm confident in the earnings potential of the company and pleased to have the financial flexibility to announce today's agreement with Katz Group, as well as the $650 million increase to our share repurchase authorization. I believe we are well positioned for continued success.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As you just heard, McKesson delivered solid third quarter operating results, in line with our expectations, but our results did include a $42 million product alignment charge in our Technology Solutions segment in the quarter. Overall, one month into the fourth quarter, we continue to expect a strong finish to the year. Let me briefly start by mentioning one other item that while not impacting our adjusted earnings, did impact our GAAP results this quarter, specifically the $27 million AWP litigation charge.  As you recall, McKesson had previously settled all private payer AWP claims during the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Since then, we have continued to work through the remaining public entity claims. We have been engaged in ongoing settlement discussions to resolve potential and pending federal and state Medicaid program claims relating to AWP. We have now reached agreements in principle with the Department of Justice and a coalition of state attorneys general to resolve both federal and state Medicaid claims relating to AWP. We expect substantial participation in the state settlement, although the final level is not yet known.  As a result of these agreements and progress made towards potentially resolving other public entity claims, the litigation reserve has been increased by a pretax charge of $27 million. This charge has been recorded in the Distribution Solutions segment, and it equates to $0.06 per diluted share. My remaining comments today will now focus on our $1.40 adjusted EPS, which as you recall, excludes 3 items: acquisition-related expenses; amortization of acquisition-related intangibles; and certain litigation reserve adjustments, including the $27 million pretax AWP charge I just discussed. The numbers I will review in my discussion can be found on Schedules 2 and 3, included in today's press release.  Let me now begin with our consolidated results for the quarter, which can be found on Schedule 2A. Consolidated revenues for the quarter grew 9% to $30.8 billion. Excluding the impact of US Oncology, total revenues increased 6% for the quarter, with both segments contributing nicely to this result.  Total adjusted gross profit increased 7% for the quarter to $1.6 billion. There are a number of moving pieces here in each segment so I'll leave further comment until we get to our segment discussion.  Total adjusted operating expenses for the quarter increased 9% to $995 million. Excluding the impact of US Oncology, overall adjusted operating expense grew roughly 3% year-over-year. For the full year, we expect our adjusted operating expense growth to be in the neighborhood of 2% to 4%, excluding the impact of US Oncology.  Other income was a loss of $2 million for the quarter, primarily driven by an asset impairment we recorded in our corporate segment.  Interest expense of $64 million increased for the quarter, primarily due to the debt we've put in place as a result of the US Oncology acquisition. Our full year assumption of $260 million of interest expense in fiscal 2012 remains unchanged. Moving now to taxes. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter of approximately 31% benefited from $5 million of favorable discrete tax items, but is otherwise roughly in line with the 32% run rate that we continue to expect for the full year. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $351 million, and our adjusted earnings per share was $1.40. As a reminder, this $1.40 adjusted EPS includes approximately $0.11 related to the product alignment charge John discussed earlier, that we took in our Technology Solutions segment this quarter. To wrap up our consolidated results, this year's earnings per share number was aided by the cumulative impact of our share repurchases, which lowered our diluted weighted average shares outstanding by 3% year-over-year to 251 million. We continue to expect our full year average diluted shares to come in a bit below the original guidance assumption of 253 million shares outstanding. Let's now move onto a discussion of our 2 segments, which can be found on Schedule 3A. Our Distribution Solutions total revenues increased 9% for the quarter versus the prior year. Direct Distribution and Services revenues grew 11% for the quarter to $21.6 billion. Excluding the impact of US Oncology, third quarter direct revenues increased 7%, primarily due to market growth rates.  Warehouse revenues were up 10% for the quarter to $5.2 billion, primarily driven by revenues associated with a new customer.  Canadian revenues, on a constant currency basis, declined 3% for the quarter, due in part to government-imposed price reductions on generics and one less sales day. Including an unfavorable currency impact, revenues decreased 4% for the quarter.  As John mentioned earlier, the team has done a good job thus far mitigating the regulatory challenges we faced coming into the fiscal year, and our Canadian results continue to track favorably to our original plan. Medical-Surgical revenues were up 2% for the quarter to $760 million, primarily driven by market growth, along with the fact, as John said, that we saw earlier sales of the flu vaccine this year as compared to last year in our Medical-Surgical business.  Adjusted gross profit for the segment increased 11% for the quarter to $1.2 billion. Excluding the impact of the US Oncology acquisition, Distribution Solutions' adjusted gross profit would be up approximately 3%.  Distribution Solutions' adjusted operating expense was up 10% for the quarter. But excluding US Oncology, our adjusted operating expense growth was just 2%. We are pleased with the team's ability to control expense growth.  The adjusted operating margin rate for the segment was 191 basis points this quarter versus 188 basis points a year ago. As you have heard me say many times before, given the quarterly timing fluctuations in this segment, we always focus on full year margins. Therefore, for full year fiscal 2012, we continue to expect Distribution Solutions' adjusted operating margin improvement in the high single-digit basis points. Moving now to Technology Solutions. Let me start by talking about the $42 million pretax product alignment charge, which equates to approximately $0.11 after tax. This charge, which was recorded in our Provider Technology hospital-facing business, was comprised of $22 million of non-cash asset impairments, $6 million for severance, $6 million for customer allowances and $8 million for other product alignment initiatives.  Total segment revenues were up 4% from the prior year to $823 million, primarily driven by growth in our Provider Technologies business as a result of progress made with customer implementations.  As a reminder, last year's third quarter included approximately $23 million of previously deferred revenue related to a disease management contract with CMS. So when you exclude the favorable impact of this $23 million in the prior year, Technology Solutions' revenues grew approximately 7% for the quarter versus last year. Technology Solutions' adjusted gross profit decreased 3% to $370 million, driven in part by the current year's product alignment charge. Of the total $42 million charge, $26 million was recorded in the cost of sales line. Excluding both the impact of $26 million from the product alignment charge this year and the $23 million of deferred revenue recognition in the prior year, Technology Solutions' adjusted gross profit increased approximately 10% for the quarter.  Technology Solutions' operating -- adjusted operating expenses increased 8% in the quarter to $282 million. $16 million of the total $42 million product alignment charge was recorded in the adjusted operating expense line. So factoring this out, adjusted operating expenses would have increased just 2% for the quarter. While we've had tight control on our expenses, we do continue to invest in the business for our customers. Total gross R&D spending in this segment was $113 million for the quarter, an increase of 4% versus the prior year. Of this amount, we capitalized 8% compared to 10% a year ago.  Our adjusted operating margin in this segment was 10.81% for the quarter compared to 15.32% in the prior year. If you exclude the current year product align charge, adjusted operating margin would have been roughly 15.92% for the quarter.  For the full fiscal year, excluding the product alignment charge, we now expect to be more towards the midpoint of our long-term adjusted operating margin goal range of 14% to 16%, given the good progress we have made with customer implementations. Leaving our segment performance, and turning now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. Here again, timing can have a meaningful impact on each of our working capital metrics. Our receivables were $9.7 billion, up from the prior year balance of $8.7 billion, and our days sales outstanding increased to 25 days from 24 days last year.  Compared to a year ago, inventories were up 9% to $10.4 billion, while payables were up 15% to $15.7 billion. So our days sales and inventory of 32 days was flat to the prior year, while our days sales and payables increased to 3 days from a year ago to 48 days.  These working capital metrics resulted in McKesson generating $1.7 billion in operating cash flow year-to-date. For the full year, we continue to expect to generate in excess of $2 billion in cash flow from operations.  We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $4.2 billion. Of this amount, approximately $2 billion was offshore and a portion of that balance is expected to fund the acquisition of the Katz Group assets that we announced today.  In thinking about our domestic cash balance, which does remain above our minimum cash balance needs, we will of course consider our portfolio approach to capital deployment.  Part of this approach, we are pleased that the Board of Directors recently approved an additional $650 million share repurchase authorization. Our total share repurchase authorization is now $1.5 billion, giving us additional flexibility to deploy our capital and maximize shareholder value in a variety of ways. Overall, our gross to capital ratio was 35% for the quarter, right in the middle of our target range.  Returning to our cash flows. Capitalized spending was $307 million for the first 9 months of the fiscal year, trending as expected at $450 million to $500 million for the full year. Now I'll turn to our outlook. As John mentioned earlier, we are maintaining our guidance on adjusted earnings at $6.19 to $6.39. The continued strength we saw across pretty much all of our businesses in both segments effectively offset the product alignment charge we took this quarter as we think about our full year results.  One final point about our fiscal 2012 outlook. We expect $0.07 for acquisition-related expenses and $0.48 for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. In addition, due to the AWP litigation charge we recorded this quarter, we are now assuming $0.37 for litigation reserve adjustments. In closing, we feel good about our operating results and about the strength of our balance sheet, which supports our portfolio approach to capital deployment. We remain optimistic about the future of our businesses. Thanks, and with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] First up is Robert Willoughby Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: John or Jeff, what are you buying with the Katz acquisition exactly in terms of bricks and mortar? And what are the gives and takes of the model? I guess with the current customer now, what kinds of adjustments do you anticipate as making from a revenue standpoint, if any?
John H. Hammergren: I think the way to think about this is that it's very similar to the banner operations we already are involved in operating in Canada. So we will take over the responsibly of owning the banners and operating the banners. And in Canada, I would say that our experience has been we have a more fulsome relationship with those banner operators and the ability to provide additional products and services to those customers that improve our performance and simultaneously improve their performance. So our goal always is to find tools that we can bring to our customers that make them more successful, and in return improving our business performance at the same time. So although, there won't be a lot of incremental revenue associated with the transaction, we certainly believe it will have a very nice returns and well above our cost of capital when you think about it from a financial context.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: So it's a franchise fee or something you're booking and the distribution revenues, you've probably already included already then?
John H. Hammergren: Yes, that's the way to think about it. We don't own the stores physical plant, and we don't own the "pharmacists." They still operate their stores, but we run the rest of it.
Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And any -- hazard a guess on the amortization on the deal?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: It's always difficult at this point in the process to know what's going to end up on the balance sheet, it's something we're not going to amortize versus something we're going to amortization. That's why we tried to give you a little bit of guidance on an adjusted EPS basis, so if we're not really sure final noncash amortization will be.
Operator: Next up, we'll hear from Robert Jones, Goldman Sachs.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just a follow-up on the acquisition. I think we've all known about some of the reimbursement pressures on generics from the Canadian government. I know this is just one quarter, but sales from the Canadian business looked a little soft this quarter. I guess maybe just why now on the Katz Group? What made the timing right now make sense?
John H. Hammergren: Well, as we mentioned -- as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we have been very successful at mitigating some of the efforts associated with the regulatory changes, and clearly we have better visibility into those regulatory changes today than we might have had even last year or certainly a couple of years ago. So we understand their effect, and we certainly can contemplate what effect they may have on a deal like this acquisition that we just announced. Having said all of that, we believe scale matters in all of our businesses, and our ability to bring our sourcing power together with their demand, coupled with our existing demand, will only improve our ability to help our customers get the right products at the right price and continue to deliver great service to patients throughout those markets. So we're very optimistic on how this looks to us.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Great. And then just switching over to the IT business, we saw the charge related to RCM this quarter. I was wondering, will there be -- sorry if I missed this, will there be another charge next quarter related to this? And then I guess more broadly, can you maybe talk about the outlook for Horizon Clinical and maybe the long-term impact this could have on the overall clinical franchise?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Let me start Robert. In terms of a charge, there maybe a couple million dollars that we incur in the March quarter, but all of that would be factored into both the EPS guidance I gave, as well as the comments I made about the margins for the full year that we expect in that segment. So we're, excluding this charge, pretty optimistic and certainly we took all the actions we did on these products, because we think it really positions us and our customers well for the long term.
John H. Hammergren: Turning to the Horizon Clinical question. And I guess just a clarification too, Robert, on revenue cycle management. We are no longer developing the Horizon platform of revenue cycle, our enterprise revenue cycle management, but the revenue cycle management business inside of McKesson is alive and well, both in the form of Paragon's revenue cycle and financial systems, but also Relay and other parts of our business provide revenue cycle tools that are very valuable to our customers. So the only business that we really shut down with this acquisition -- or excuse me, with this announcement was the development effort underway for Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management. On the Horizon Clinical side, we have a lot of work to do to continue help our customers get through Meaningful Use 2 and Meaningful Use 3, to make sure our products are all contemporary with the regulatory requirements that are necessary, and we plan to continue to support that product vigorously through that phase. There are no announced plans nor internal plans to sunset the Horizon Clinical product lines. We believe our customers will continue to get great value and utility out of Horizon Clinicals. But we also believe, over time, they'll begin to look at some of the other products and applications that we have in addition to Horizon Clinical as alternatives.
Operator: From Lazard, we'll hear from Tom Gallucci.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: First one was just a quick one on Katz. You already own some banner sort of franchises. Can you just describe the competitive landscape, will existing ones see this as an increasingly competitive move internally? Or how do you view that issue?
John H. Hammergren: Well we run over -- we're involved in over 600 banners in the country -- in the country of Canada now, but they're largely outside of the area where the Katz -- in fact, I think entirely outside of the Katz, where the Katz stores reside. So there isn't a lot of competitive overlap. Furthermore, there's probably more interest from our existing banners to see the benefit of a larger scale banner operation run by McKesson in Canada. So I think we will -- Katz has not experienced much attrition of their banners over time. They've had a great deal of customer satisfaction and loyalty, and we believe that loyalty will not only remain in place for us but perhaps even improve as we go forward. And we should be attracting more people into our banners across Canada over time because of that value we deliver.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. That's helpful. And then my follow-up, obviously there's been a lot of speculation, in the investment community any way, on potential customer churn and bringing generics in-house or not by various customers, just wanted to give you the opportunity for you to comment on -- on are there any customer specifically or the competitive landscape generally as you see it.
John H. Hammergren: Any year that goes by, there's always a few ins and outs in the customer base. And we clearly want to retain as many as we can, but we're also not unrealistic and know that occasionally, for whatever reason, we will win or lose a customer. We have a view, I think, that the market remains competitive but stable, and our sales forces are always out there trying to make sure that we're moving up the value chain with our customers, improving their performance and getting them to realize that through McKesson's service, they're getting a great result. Clearly as we did -- we began this year, I believe, we focused on expanding our operating margin in the 200 to 250 basis point range. We gave that guidance because we believed the markets will remain competitive and stable and that we would be able to drive value through the mix of business that we're selling to our customers, and through the efficiencies we can run on our operations. So we made -- we remain very focused on those objectives, expanding our margins, and that objective would not be attainable should we enter into a price-oriented sale into our marketplace. As it relates to generics in-house versus out of house, clearly we're always focused on helping our customers do a better job of buying products. We hope that their #1 choice of supply will come through us, and we have to earn that privilege. But frankly, none of our contracts acquire 100% use of McKesson from a generic sourcing perspective. And we do have specific contract terms with all of our customers when we set our pricing that lays out our expectations, and our customers meet the expectations as we've laid them out in our contracts. So we really don't leave this as an open-end question, Tom. It's a very thoughtful process, and we, as part of our discussions with our customers, when these contracts are put in place, we anticipate their desire to perhaps move in and out of the generic business a little bit on their own. But it really is, I think, the larger scale movement that we've noticed is our customers coming more to McKesson for generics en masse as opposed to leaving McKesson from the generics perspective.
Operator: And next is Glen Santangelo, Crédit Suisse. Sir, your line is open. Please check your mute function.
Operator: Up Next is Larry Marsh, Barclays Capital.
Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Two clarifications and a question really, if I could. Katz, are you saying $0.10 to $0.20 accretive to adjusted earnings for fiscal '13? And if so, that's about a $35 million swing factor, what would cause a variation to get to the high and low end? And then a quick follow-up on Horizon.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well Larry, what we're really saying is $0.10 to $0.20 in the first 12 months after it closes. We're anxious. We think this is a very straightforward transaction from a regulatory perspective, and we're hopeful to get it closed quickly. What we put in the press release, you'll note is, an expectation it certainly will get closed sometime during the first half of the calendar year. As to what would provide that big a swing, look, we haven't even closed the transaction. We haven't given guidance for FY '13. You're quite correct that we'll be able to narrow the range as each of those 2 things happen, but we're just trying to give people an initial feel for the magnitude of this transaction.
Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got it, okay. And then the $42 million for Horizon Enterprise, $20 million of that is cash expense. Could you elaborate on what those are? And is that -- any sort of guide of what we could think about in terms of ongoing cost savings now that you're not going to be supporting the specific development of Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management going forward?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Yes. I don't think I quite broke it out cash, non-cash, but you are correct that there's $22 million of writing stuff off on the balance sheet, mostly prepaid licenses, those sorts of things. A little bit of capitalized software. And you had $6 million of severance, because as John pointed out in his remark, the one place where we did shut something down is we have stopped development on the Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management platform. Some of those folks have been very usefully redeployed on our expanded development efforts on Paragon, and we certainly continue to develop the Horizon Clinical product. But there's some net savings from that severance. And then the other charge was for the modest number of Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management customers where we had contracts in place. We've clearly reached agreement with those customers on how we're going to proceed with them going forward.
Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And finally, just I know you've shown a very consistent rate of growth over a long period of time, I guess the 10-plus years that you have been CEO John, and for fiscal '13, communicating some potential accretion with Katz. But I know you're going to guide in May, but are there any other big puts and takes we should think about at this point of the year as we think about fiscal '13?
John H. Hammergren: Yes. As you said, it's probably a little early for us to think about fiscal '13. There are some headwinds and tailwinds as we think about that timeline. Clearly oral generics are going to be a positive, and the whole industry is expecting that. At the same time, we'll probably have a little bit of a headwind from a specialty generic perspective particularly on a year-over-year kind of compare. We believe that the balance sheet will continue provide significant opportunity for us going forward in our portfolio approach. Having said that, we also are going to probably face a little bit of a headwind from the VA contract, which as you know is 8 years old, and if we're fortunate enough to renew it, it will provide a little bit of a headwind even renewing it. But having said all of that, I think that we feel we're very well positioned in our industry, demographic support, the growth of our businesses, and I think we will continue to see good results out of our company.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: The only thing I'd add, Larry is as we've talked about in the past, some of the regulatory pricing step-downs in Canada, there's one further step-down and that will create a little modest headwind for us next year as well.
Operator: Up next, we'll hear from Steven Valiquette, UBS.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Another question here on the Katz Group. I think at one point in last year, I think they were testing that self-distribution model. I think it was ultimately terminated. But I'm just curious if the prospect of Katz moving to this self-distribution model. Does that play any role in this acquisition? Or does it really have nothing to do with it?
John H. Hammergren: Yes. I don't believe it had anything to do with it -- at least from our perspective, I don't know what the Katz Group had contemplated in that process. But we had already renewed the Katz agreement for both their corporate stores and these banners prior to us really entering into any significant dialogue about what they might do with their banner operations. And I think the corporate store agreement that's going forward hasn't been really materially impacted as a result of this arrangement.
Operator: Our next question today will be from Charles Rhyee, Cowen & Company.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: I just want to follow up on the Provider Technologies segment here. First off, Jeff, you said that for the full year, if we ignore the charge for the realignment plan for the full year, we're going to come into the middle of the range. That kind of suggests maybe a sequential downtick in the margin. Is there anything particular in the fourth quarter that we should be thinking about?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well I think at least as I do the math, Charles, depending on whether you're towards the high end of the midpoint or low end of the midpoint, you don't necessarily go down sequentially. We're not trying to telegraph anything about the March quarter and don't particularly expect it to be down sequentially. We have had a pretty good year in MTS. And so it probably is less March quarter-loaded than the history of that business might suggest. The other thing, if you've heard us talk about over time, is as the transaction processing and payer-facing businesses in that segment have continued to grow and become a larger portion of the total earnings, those tend to be businesses that are pretty steady quarter-to-quarter and it's really the hospital software business that historically has been pretty March-loaded. So you put all that together, and we really have a much more even flow of earnings, excluding the charge across the year, and we're not trying to signal anything other than that.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Great. And then just a clarification, when you're talking about the realignment plan and you're here calling very specifically that it's really stopping development on Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management, but at the same time if I recall, there was an earlier interview on -- that was in print, and I think it was with Dave talking about sort of the strategic roadmap here and offering the option for clients to go to Paragon. For Horizon clients on Clinicals that choose to go to Paragon, is this considered just a switchover that's counted within maintenance? Or would they have to repurchase the Paragon suite?
John H. Hammergren: Well I think that the simple answer is it depends. Each customer is really working with us on a specific plan. If they want to move to the Paragon product line, our role is to make sure that they feel good about a transition like that, and that they -- in the end of the discussion, get more. And when they get more functionality and lower cost of ownership, they're even more satisfied with McKesson. So I think that each relationship will take on a different tenor. I think there are some customers already that have already said to us, "You know what, this is good news from our perspective. We like the Paragon platform. We understand what you're trying to do with it from a development perspective, and we think it will position us very well when we think out to 2020 for the kinds of demands we're going to have around medical home and accountable care and other things we have to do that the existing marketplace products really won't deliver for us." And so those folks are already in in-depth discussions. But having been involved in some of them, there are no 2 alike, because there's no really 2 customer footprint that's identical to another. So I would say the most important takeaway from this is that we're doing everything we can to make sure that our customers are making the right decision for them at the right time, and this is just another alternative for them to evaluate, particularly if they're already on the Horizon platform that they have this as an option. We're not going to force them to evaluate it right now. We're not going to force them to make any changes until they're ready.
Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: That's helpful. And if I could just add one quick last follow-up here. As we think about the next phase of this space. I mean it sounds like you're -- with this development and focus on integrated sort of clinical to financial offering, also in conjunction with your sort of -- I mean the development on the Horizon ERM by itself. I mean is it really the next sort of phase of this industry that we'll be moving to a clinical sort of fully integrated platform that clients are looking for?
John H. Hammergren: Well we think there'll be 3 things they're going to have to focus on. Certainly one is the integration of clinical and financial records and the sort of a longitudinal view of the patient, both inpatient and outpatient. The second is going to be cost of ownership. And frankly, most of our provider customers are under tremendous pressure to reduce cost, and we believe that the Paragon platform, in particular, will provide a very low cost solution for our customers over time. And the third element that most of them are beginning now to come to grips with are probably 2 dual functions. One is the web enablement of products, the ability to have sort of access anywhere, anytime to the data they need from a myriad of sources whether they're payer sources or whether they're retail pharmacy sources or consumer-related connectivity. And the second dimension is the analytics on the data that they're getting access to. So we're investing heavily in both sort of the web strategy, the connectivity strategy, as you've heard us talk about with Relay and you've also heard us talking about advanced analytics as a component part. So product that's fully functioning, integrated single data view of the patient, low cost of ownership and increasingly flexible enough to integrate with the other constituents in healthcare realtime in a web friendly kind of Software-as-a-Service way, as well as this analytic engine.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Up next we'll take Ross Muken, Deutsche Bank.
Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Maybe on the generic pricing front, any updated thoughts sort of on the level of inflation we're sort of seeing and whether there's been any sort of change to the trend we've seen over the last couple of quarters?
John H. Hammergren: I don't think we've seen any significant trend changes. The price performance of generics is largely in line with our expectations and relatively stable.
Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. Maybe just quickly on the cap deployment front. I mean I saw you upsized, and Jeff you talked about the buyback. And we've obviously -- I think it's been 2 straight quarters where we've had little activity, and it makes sense given the M&A. Is sort of the signal here or at least maybe later in this year as we turn into your fiscal '13 given the size of the remaining buyback, we'll start to see that sort of activity pick up again?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, Ross, you know that we never comment on share buyback we're planning to do. I would just make or reiterate maybe the couple observations I made in the script. And that if you look at our domestic cash balance, it was a little over $2 billion. And we probably need in our domestic system, let's call it, $750 million or so. So there's a significant level of excess cash, which as you point out, has been sitting there for a while, and we don't try to every quarter sweep our balance sheet down to the absolute minimum cash balance level. On the other hand, we don't have a plan to forever sit on cash. You should expect to see us in the relative near to medium term deploy significant amount of domestic cash. And what you see from our board's action is we now have the flexibility, if the best way to do that is through share repurchase, to do that.
Operator: Lisa Gill of JP Morgan has the next question.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: John and Jeff, my first question would just be around your direct drug distribution revenue. John I mean up 7% is clearly better than what we're seeing anywhere else across the channel. Can you maybe talk about -- is it specific customers? Are your customers buying more product from you? How should we think about this and also think about it on a go-forward basis?
John H. Hammergren: Well we're clearly pleased with our revenue performance, Lisa. And I think it really is sort of strength across the board with our customers. I wouldn't want to forecast off of that kind of revenue growth, but I do believe that we're just experiencing a byproduct of our customers' continued success. We did -- on the indirect or warehouse revenue line, we did pick up an incremental customer there that's added to that strength.
Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then just a follow-up, John, on the VA contract. I understand there'll be a hearing on Wednesday. Any thoughts around what they're looking at as they look at the overall private vendor contract? And any thoughts as to what potentially could come out of this hearing on Wednesday?
John H. Hammergren: Well we are aware of the hearing, and we'll actually be participating in the hearing. We are proud of the service we've provided to the VA and the kind of savings we provided. We clearly -- I know there's been questions raised about certain elements of the way the VA has executed their activity under our agreement, and we continue to participate as asked in the discussions that are underway. We don't believe it will have any impact on their consideration of us as a potential awardee of this contract that's coming up in May.
Operator: Citi's George Hill has the next question.
George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And just a quick comment, I must not be getting north of the border too much because we call them Katz down here as opposed to Katz. Just on, circling back on the IT business for a second, is there any chance you'll be willing to quantify for us potentially the revenue at risk or the value at risk if we think of how much revenue is tied to the legacy Horizon Revenue Management base?
John H. Hammergren: Well we'd like to think that none of our revenue base in Horizon is at risk because we've committed to our customers to get them through the most important aspects associated with their near-term priority and that's Meaningful Use 2, Meaningful Use 3 and clearly some ICD-10 work that's going on in many of our product lines. Our commitment to their satisfaction and to them accomplishing their objectives is unwavering, and this announcement only affected a small subgroup of our customers that were developing strategies to implement Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management. Clearly those handful of customers we had to go to and have a conversation about the fact the product that they had ordered at had an interest in ordering is not going to be available, and their alternative would be to return to the STAR platforms, that many of them are on -- or stay on STAR, or consider the Paragon financial strategy. As it relates to Horizon Clinical customers, clearly there are some that are asking questions about whether they should stay on Horizon, whether they should go to Paragon or whether they should consider going to an alternative. I think the number of customers that are in that bucket probably, although it may not be the same names, probably hasn't changed an awful lot since we announced the Paragon strategy. And so we -- as you know, we've had some challenges with the Horizon Clinical implementations. We believe that we've made significant progress now. And to a large extent, the history of the product is overshadowed by our current success with the product. Having said that, clearly we always have customers that might be considering alternatives. But our goal here for that small set of customers that are considering an alternative is to give them one more, which is to move to Paragon, because we believe Paragon, for some of our customers, will be a nice choice, particularly if they believe Horizon isn't meeting their needs.
George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: That's great color, John. Maybe just a quick follow-up. Just remind me, if I'm remembering kind of the product roll-up right. So it was HealthQuest, STAR and Series that rolled up under the Horizon banner, and then Paragon was part of the acquired product that went in that direction?
John H. Hammergren: Well HealthQuest, Series and STAR were actually older brands that were acquired, or companies. And those products had remained and do remain largely unchanged, however, always updated for certain functionality and regulatory compliance. The Horizon financial product was a brand-new product that had, had no basis from an acquisition perspective. And the Horizon Clinical product line was not built off of the STAR, HealthQuest or Series platforms. It was a lot of internal development, as well as some acquisitions on the outside. So I think Horizon Clinicals and Horizon Financials were 2 different strategies from a product architecture perspective coming together later. And there's one other nuance that our customers and our shareholders should understand is that we use the Horizon name perhaps more liberally than just on the clinical products. You might recall that we acquired a medical imaging product that's leading in the industry from a company called A.L.I. that has been part of McKesson now for a long time. That's actually called Horizon Medical Imaging, for example, and that product line is on a Microsoft platform. It will not be touched by the changes we've just announced with Horizon Clinicals. So the Horizon name is used in the business as a branding tool, but it isn't necessarily accurate as it relates to architectural decisions or other decisions that might be made with the product.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Up next is Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So 2 follow-ups here. One on the potential headwind from the VA contract before we renew it in fiscal year '13. Should we think about the Katz acquisition as kind of like filling in that void if you achieve the upper end of the guidance range for the acquisition?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Ricky, I guess I don't see any relationship. We have a long track record of using our portfolio approach to capital deployment to make, what, everything smooths [ph], makes sense strategically and financially, and that's what Katz is. The VA is obviously a unique situation given the unique nature of the bidding process, and we'll just have to see how that comes out. But I wouldn't, in any way, tie the 2 together.
John H. Hammergren: I would say though, Ricky, our goal obviously is to grow our company and to grow it profitably and to deploy our capital intelligently. Those are not in conflict with our strategy with the VA contract, and I would say they're 2 parallel paths headed in the same direction, which is a high-performing company doing the right thing for our customers and our shareholders. But certainly we would have pursued the Katz acquisition sort of regardless of what happens with the VA, and we'll pursue the VA regardless of the fact that we acquired Katz. And so I think that's the point we're trying to make.
Operator: And Raymond James' John Ransom is up next.
John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: How are you guys thinking about the AMP effect that apparently is going to go in effect in 2013 both in terms of the Medicaid reductions number of [indiscernible] potential transparency it brings to generic [indiscernible] and the effect on margins?
John H. Hammergren: Well the AMP stands for average manufacturer prices, this is an activity our government has been pursuing for some time as it relates to the way they reimburse purchases to our customers. So it really is not something that would directly affect wholesaling in our country, and I think that we are continuing to study what's going on with AMP just like everyone else in the pharmaceutical business. And I don't -- other than the fact that we're always trying to optimize the performance of our customers and to make sure that they're being well compensated for the service they provide, our interest in AMP is more of an observer.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Eric Coldwell, Robert W. Baird.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: If you could, could you tell me what the average revenue for an independent pharmacy in Canada is, just big picture?
John H. Hammergren: I'm sorry could you repeat that question?
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Yes. The average revenue for an independent pharmacy in Canada, is it in the ballpark of $2 million, thereabout?
John H. Hammergren: Yes. I don't know. It's probably in the $2 million to $3 million kind of range. I'm just guessing based on these numbers. But Jeff, do you have...
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Yes. There is a wider range than that. So we have stores that are even a little under $1 million up to that $3 million range. But it depends a little bit on how you define independent as well.
John H. Hammergren: And how you define average.  Thank you very much for your questions today. I want to thank you all for getting on the call. I'm certainly pleased with our year-to-date performance, and I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. I'm now going to had the call off to Ana for her review of upcoming events for the financial community.
Ana Schrank: Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events. On February 8, we will present at the UBS Healthcare Services conference in New York. On May 8, we will present at the Deutsche Bank Healthcare conference in Boston. On May 15, we will present at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Healthcare conference in Las Vegas. We plan to release fourth quarter earnings results in early May. We look forward to seeing you at one of these upcoming events. Thank you, and goodbye.
Operator: Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. We would like to thank you all for your participation. Have a great day.

Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Ana Schrank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Ana Schrank: Thank you, Rebecca. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2012 Second Quarter Earnings Call. With me today are John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and Jeff Campbell, our CFO. John will first provide a business update, and we'll then introduce Jeff who will review the financial results for the quarter. After Jeff's comments, we'll open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after 1 hour at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results acquisition-related expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and certain litigation reserve adjustments. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for investors. Please refer to our press release announcing second quarter fiscal 2012 results available on our website for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results.  Thanks, and here is John Hammergren.
John H. Hammergren: Thanks, Ana, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. I'm pleased with the continued momentum in our business. For our second quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $30.2 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.63. This performance is a result of strong contributions from both Technology Solutions and Distribution Solutions and was helped by our acquisition of US Oncology. Based on the momentum from our first half results, we are now raising our previous outlook for the fiscal year and now expect adjusted earnings between $6.19 and $6.39 per diluted share for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012.  Before I turn the call over to Jeff for a detailed review of our financial results, I will provide some highlights from both segments of our business. In Distribution Solutions, we were particularly pleased to see steady demand across all of our pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical distribution businesses. We know that there are concerns in the industry about utilization trends, but we've seen healthy demand in our diverse set of distribution businesses. In addition to strong revenue growth, Distribution Solutions' operating margins expanded 19 basis points with U.S. Pharmaceutical, Canada, Medical-Surgical and Specialty Health all contributing to that outstanding performance. Our U.S. Pharmaceutical Distribution business continues to perform in an exceptionally high level. Again this quarter, the U.S. Pharmaceutical team did a great job controlling costs, resulting in a relatively flat expense for the quarter, which contributed nicely to the segment's operating margin expansion. We continue to benefit from our long-standing relationships with branded manufacturers, delivering great value to them and earning steady levels of compensation in return. Overall, U.S. Pharmaceutical is right on target for the year.  I'm extremely pleased with the results of our Specialty Health business, which includes the operations of US Oncology. We began this year with a set of priorities focusing on integrating the 2 companies and creating an expanded customer base and an expanded value proposition to these important customers that brings together all of our assets of both businesses. Thus far, we made great progress combining the 2 organizations, and the majority of the integration work is now complete and we are realizing synergies from the transaction. We're also creating real momentum in the marketplace.  At the end of the second quarter, our Specialty business launched a new name and offering to the marketplace, reflecting the expanded business unit created by merging McKesson Specialty Care Solutions and US Oncology. Now called the McKesson Specialty Health, the business empowers providers, from hospitals to community oncologists to other multi-specialty providers, to advance the science, technology and quality of care through innovative clinical, research, business and operational solutions. Our customers are responding very positively to our new, broader offering.  While we've expanded our value proposition considerably, I would note that generics continue to play an important role in Specialty's performance. We've had strong results year-to-date, and we expect the trend to continue for the remainder of the fiscal year.  Our Medical-Surgical revenues grew 13% in the second quarter, partially due to 5 extra days of sales but also as a result of very steady market growth in the physician office and long-term care segments and above-market growth in the home care segment for McKesson. This year, we saw slightly earlier sales of flu vaccine as well. We remain focused on delivering value to our Medical-Surgical customers by optimizing our sourcing of the McKesson brand where we deliver high-quality private label products at great savings. In addition, we continue to drive leverage through aggressive cost management. The team in our Canadian Distribution business has done an outstanding job of working to offset public policy-related price reductions on generic drugs. Solid top line growth, a continued focus on expense control measures and global sourcing of McKesson products led to a good performance for the quarter. Clearly, the environment in Canada has been challenging for retail pharmacies over the past year and, in particular, for independent pharmacies. McKesson Canada has a long history of supporting independent pharmacies through our banner offering and our retail automation solutions and, of course, our broad Specialty offering. We've built a strong brand in Canada with leading physicians in every market segment and close customer relationships. This continues to be a terrific business for us. Our comprehensive set of both distribution and technology solutions for customers clearly differentiates McKesson, and our goal is to continue to grow in Canada. To sum up Distribution Solutions, in Distribution solutions we had a strong second quarter performance resulting from our terrific combination of assets and a seasoned leadership team that continues to perform exceptionally well. I have great confidence in our full year performance.  Turning now to Technology Solutions. I'm pleased with our performance across the segment. All of the businesses that make up Technology Solutions performed well this quarter, resulting in strong revenue growth and operating margin expansion. As we look across our portfolio of technology businesses, we see steady demand resulting from a number of factors, including the government's focus on broad adoption of Electronic Health Record Solutions, the transaction-based nature of certain of our businesses such as RelayHealth and the increasing demand for solutions that help payers manage financial, administrative and clinical processes, all while improving quality.  This quarter, in our Provider Technology (sic) [Technologies] business, we made solid progress with implementations at both our Horizon and Paragon systems with several customers successfully attesting [ph] for Meaningful Use in both product sets. We also had good expense control, which helped drive financial performance beyond what we experienced 90 days ago. With the publication of the final rule for Medicare Shared Savings Program, sometimes referred to as accountable care regulation, we expect to see continued activity where providers are seeking to defend or grow market share in their area. With the revision of several major components of the regulation, we believe this will accelerate demand for our unique solutions.  To address the various approaches customers are taking, we recommend and offer solutions to our customers that include connectivity and patient engagement, analytics, care management and payment mechanics. McKesson's accountable care solution bundle combines RelayHealth Connectivity assets with the care and population management assets in our payer business, McKesson Health Solutions. These solutions can be combined with Horizon, Paragon and enterprise intelligence to help providers preserve and extend existing investments while managing to a strategic organizational structure that fits their needs. We believe our comprehensive set of solutions for hospitals, payers, pharmacies, physicians and patients is a strong differentiator for us.  Both our payer-facing Health Solutions business and our RelayHealth Connectivity business showed steady results year-over-year in the September quarter. As a reminder, these 2 businesses account for over half of the profits in Technology Solutions, and a number of these solutions require little capital investment by the customer. Therefore, they are very steady growth businesses that have continued to demonstrate considerable stability during the past 2 years of economic uncertainty.  In our Health Solutions business, we learned this quarter that CMS will use McKesson's InterQual criteria for the 12th consecutive year to support Medicare initiatives. The long-standing nature of this relationship is a good example of the value that our solutions bring to our partners year-after-year.  In our RelayHealth business, we focus on one thing, connectivity, so consumers and health care organizations can securely exchange information. This focus reflects our belief that a streamlined exchange of information is better for everyone touched by the nation's health care system. In the quarter, RelayHealth was awarded multiple contracts to support the Department of Defense and the military health system's strategic goals for a more patient-centric medical home model of care. RelayHealth will provide a full suite of secure online services to connect patients who are active-duty military, retirees, spouses and dependents with their health care providers and the care team, to a secure messaging platform and integrated personal health record. This capability provides the Department of Defense with the unique ability to deliver more advanced, patient-centric care directly and the ability to extend this connectivity out to the community providers, enabling an exceptional connectivity platform to improve patient-centric care across the country.  In summary, we're off to a good start to fiscal 2012. In addition to solid operating performance, our strong balance sheet and steady cash flow provide us with opportunities to deploy capital. And in the second quarter, we completed our $650 million accelerated share repurchase program. We target a portfolio approach to capital deployment, which should also include acquisitions. You should feel confident that we intend to continue deploying our capital wisely and strategically. I believe we're well positioned for continued success.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff and return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. McKesson posted another quarter of strong financial results with both segments contributing to our performance. Great execution is driving our operating results, and we retain the financial flexibility to create shareholder value over the long term.  Let me briefly mention one item that impacted our financial statements this quarter, specifically the $118 million AWP litigation charge. This charge was based on 2 primary factors. First, McKesson has now reached an agreement to settle the public entity claims brought by a nationwide class of cities and counties for $82 million. This settlement agreement in a case we refer to as Douglas County, Kansas included an express denial of any liability on the part of the company. As a result of this settlement and progress made toward potentially resolving other public entity claims, the existing litigation reserve of $324 million has been increased by $118 million, bringing the total reserve for AWP public entity claims to $442 million. This $118 million pretax, noncash charge has been recorded in the Distribution Solutions segment, and it equates to $0.31 per diluted share. My comments today will focus on our $1.63 adjusted earnings per share, which, as you'll recall, excludes 3 items: acquisition-related expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and any litigation reserve adjustments, including the charge I just reviewed. The numbers I'll review in my discussion can be found on Schedules 2 and 3, included in today's press release. I'll begin with our consolidated results for the quarter, which can be found on Schedule 2A. Total revenues grew 10% for the quarter to $30.2 billion. Excluding the impact of the US Oncology acquisition that we completed last December, total revenues increased 7% for the quarter versus the prior year with both segments growing at very robust rates.  Total adjusted gross profit increased 21% from the prior year to $1.7 billion with both segments contributing nicely to this result as well. As a reminder, last year's adjusted gross profit was impacted by a $72 million noncash, pretax asset impairment charge in our Technology Solutions segment. Excluding the impact of both US Oncology this year and the prior year asset impairment, overall adjusted gross profit would have increased 9% for the quarter versus last year. Total adjusted operating expenses were up 11% to $999 million for the quarter. Higher expenses in the quarter were primarily driven by the impact of the US Oncology acquisition, which contributed roughly 5 percentage points to the total adjusted operating expense growth.  Other income was fairly flat for the quarter, $6 million. Interest expense, $64 million, was $20 million greater than the prior year due to the debt we've put in place as a result of the US Oncology acquisition. Our full year assumption of $260 million of interest expense in fiscal 2012 remains unchanged. Turning now to taxes. Our adjusted tax rate this quarter came in at about 32%, and that remains our estimate for the full year. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $408 million, and our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $1.63.  To wrap up our consolidated results, this year's earnings per share number was aided by the cumulative impact of our share repurchases, which lowered our diluted weighted average shares outstanding by 5% year-over-year to 250 million. One other point about the share count. You heard John mention earlier that we completed our $650 million accelerated share repurchase program in August. This completion date was earlier than we originally anticipated. And due to overall market movements, the final share price came in slightly lower than we originally anticipated. Taking this into account, we now expect our full year average diluted shares to come in a bit below the original guidance assumption of 253 million shares outstanding.  Let's now move on to the segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3A. In Distribution Solutions, overall revenue growth was 10% compared to the same quarter last year. Direct revenues were up 11% for the quarter to $21.1 billion. When you exclude the impact of US Oncology, our second quarter revenues increased approximately 6%, primarily driven by solid performance across our entire customer base. Warehouse revenues increased 5% to $4.9 billion, benefiting from the revenues associated with a new customer. Canadian revenues on a constant currency basis grew 2% for the quarter. Including a favorable currency impact of 6%, Canadian revenues grew 8% for the quarter. Year-to-date, our overall Canadian results are tracking modestly better than our plan because of the team's ability to effectively mitigate the regulatory challenges we faced in that marketplace.  Medical-Surgical revenues were up 13% to $873 million primarily due to 5 extra days of sales in the quarter. Excluding the impact of these 5 extra days of sales, Medical-Surgical revenues increased approximately 5% versus the prior year, partially aided by earlier flu vaccine sales. Distribution Solutions' adjusted gross profit increased 16% for the quarter to $1.3 billion. Factoring out the US Oncology acquisition, adjusted gross profit would still be up a strong 9% for the quarter. The key drivers of this adjusted gross profit growth were increased profit from generics and the timing of the compensation we receive from branded manufacturers. Adjusted operating expense in the segment was up 12% to $628 million for the quarter. Excluding US Oncology, adjusted operating expense increased 5% versus last year with the 5 additional days in our Medical-Surgical business comprising 2 of these 5 points.  Adjusted operating margin rates for the quarter were 216 basis points, an increase of 19 basis points versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of US Oncology, we are showing an 11-basis-point adjusted operating margin improvement year-over-year in this segment. Given that quarterly timing varies in this segment, we always focus on full year margins. In this context, we continue to expect adjusted operating margin improvement in the high single-digit basis points for fiscal 2012.  In summary, we're extremely pleased with the first half performance and margin expansion for businesses within Distribution Solutions. In Technology Solutions, total revenues increased a strong 7% to $825 million for the quarter with all businesses in the segment contributing to this growth. Adjusted gross profit for the segment grew 41% to $394 million, driven by the prior year's asset impairment charge. Excluding the asset impairment charge, Technology Solutions' adjusted gross profit would have increased about 12%.  Our total gross R&D spending was $115 million compared to $107 million in the prior year. Of this amount, we capitalized 9% versus 16% a year ago.  Technology Solutions' adjusted operating profit this quarter was $126 million compared to $29 million in the prior year. Excluding the prior year asset impairment charge, Technology Solutions' adjusted operating profit would be up a healthy 25%. Adjusted operating margins in this segment were 15.27%. Based on our implementation progress to date, we have now modestly increased our full year forecast for this segment. We continue to expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the low end of our long-term Technology Solutions adjusted operating margin goal range of mid-teens. Said another way, I would expect our full year margin for Technology Solutions to be below the margin we experienced this quarter. Leaving our segment performance and turning now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. As you've heard me say before, we took -- our working capital metrics can be impacted by timing, including the timing of payments or what day of week marks the close of our quarter. Our receivables were $9.5 billion, up from the prior year balance of $8.2 billion, and our days sales outstanding increased by 1 day to 25 days. Inventories were $9.4 billion, an increase of 8% over the prior year, and our payables increased 16% to $14.9 billion from a year ago. This resulted in our days sales and inventory remaining flat at 30 days, while our days sales in payables increased 3 days from a year ago to 47 days. These working capital metrics resulted in McKesson generating $1.4 billion in operating cash flow year-to-date. Given this strong performance, we now expect to generate at least $2 billion in cash flow from operations this fiscal year. Capitalized spending was $227 million for the first 6 months of the year, and we continue to expect full year capitalized spending between $450 million to $500 million. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.9 billion. Overall, we are pleased with our year-to-date performance and expect that first half momentum to continue. As a result, we're raising our guidance on adjusted earnings from $6.09 to $6.29 to a new range of $6.19 to $6.39. As John and I have both now discussed, we have seen modest strength across pretty much all of our businesses in both segments, which drives the guidance raise.  Now keeping in mind that we do not routinely provide quarterly EPS guidance, we still do anticipate our fourth quarter to be unusually strong this fiscal year. As always, I would say that our quarterly progression could change from what we believe or can forecast today. That said, as a rough guide, I'd expect as of today that measured as a percentage of our overall earnings for the year, we expect this year's fourth quarter to be similar to our experience in the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter. One last point about our fiscal 2012 outlook. We expect $0.07 for acquisition-related expenses and $0.46 for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. In addition, due to the AWP litigation charge we recorded this quarter, we are now assuming $0.31 for litigation reserve adjustments. In closing, we feel McKesson has executed well across all our businesses through the first half of fiscal 2012. We have great financial flexibility, which provides us a good opportunity to continue our capital deployment strategy to enhance shareholder value. Thanks. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Steven Valiquette from UBS.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And on the -- this trend of "less generic deflation than normal" had been a tailwind for you guys in the first half of calendar '11. I'm just curious. Just given the strength in the distribution profits for this quarter, just want to get a sense for how much that might have helped you guys in the upside from this reported quarter as well.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, Steve, as you'll recall, our guidance for the full year is based on both the branded and the generic side, seeing price trends continue the pretty favorable levels that they were at in our prior fiscal year. Now we're only 6 months into the year, so it's too early to make a call for the full year. But I would tell you that those first 6 months on both the branded and generic side are certainly consistent with the levels we experienced for the full year last year and consistent with our assumptions. So that does help us as we look at the results from the first half of the year.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Tom Gallucci with Lazard.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Just wondering, where were you in the first half, and I guess the second quarter as well, relative to your own internal expectations? And I was wondering if you could just maybe explain the 5-day issue in the med-surg business.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, I'd say, Tom, as we look at the first half of the year and, more importantly, as we look at the components of what drives our earnings, we're a little bit ahead of where we thought we'd be at this time of the year, year-to-date, and we're confident that the momentum will continue. And that's why since we started the year, you've now seen us come up about $0.20 on the guidance. In terms of med-surg, when -- this really goes back -- well, I guess we acquired the company back in the 90s, and they just have a convention and a set of systems and an operational process that is based on what's known as a 445 close process in about every 5 years or so to keep them relatively in sync with the rest of the company. We have a quarter where they get these 5 extra days.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: I guess 2006 was a long time ago. So we probably all forgot about that. I appreciate it.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: I -- that's fair.
Operator: Next we'll hear from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.
Glen J. Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Oh, yes, I just wanted to ask about the timing of the price increases on the branded side. If I remember back to 4Q '11, the company had a very unusually strong operating margin in Distribution. And I think one of the reasons was that you got paid for some of those branded price increases. They got pulled forward into fiscal '11 and maybe that somewhat explained the pretty large drop-off in op margin into the first quarter of fiscal '12. And now, all of a sudden, the margin has kind of ramped back up pretty significantly. Is there something about the timing of when you're getting paid for these branded price increases that's impacting the quarterly fluctuations the way it is?
John H. Hammergren: Well, I think historically, Glen, it's always impacted our progression from a margin perspective, and that's why it's difficult for us to comment specifically about quarterly performance. We're pretty good about the year, but we can't control certain aspects to our business model directly and we certainly can't control the timing of -- the timing or magnitude of price increases or decreases in the case of the generic products. So I think that we try to spell those out for you at the beginning of the year when we give you guidance in terms of what our assumptions are. Clearly, people might have different assumptions than ours. And we know the progression is going to be uncertain, and that's, I guess, the fact.
Operator: From Barclays Capital, we'll hear from Larry Marsh.
Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So John, just looking back, another topic. I can't think in your tenure, your 11th year of being CEO, where -- you or McKesson lost a single super-sized contract. You've certainly won some. And so, obviously, VA's coming up. I know you've said it's hard to handicap. But I guess clearly, be a big disappointment given your relationship. And I guess just to make sure we're thinking the same way, if you were to lose it, would you anticipate giving some size to the impact of fiscal '13 given the turmoil we saw in the market last time? And I think, Jeff, you've talked about sort of the economic impact as really on a gross basis. So we should really think of it as closer to $6 billion even though it's $4 billion net?
John H. Hammergren: Well, I think, Larry, clearly, thank you for the acknowledgment about our performance with our major customers over the last 11 years. We have a great team and we deliver superior performance for our customers on almost every dimension, and we're pleased with the retention rate. I would point out, though, that this industry has typically not turned over a lot of big customers. The business is stickier than some people may realize, and incumbent relationships clearly are important and there's a cost to switching. So it is a good business, and it's a good business for McKesson. As it relates to specific comments related to the VA, we have talked in the past about how this is a unique contract by the character under which the government negotiates with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers and the type of service we deliver to them, and it's not fair to probably compare them on a revenue basis to other customers of similar size because of some of these dynamics. I think it's probably premature for us to speculate what the loss of this customer would mean to us financially and what offsets we might be able to find. And clearly, it's not a fiscal '12 issue. It would be a fiscal '13 issue, as you point out, and we would have some time before we arrive in fiscal '13 to build that into whatever outlook we're going to give you for fiscal '13 if that circumstance were to arise. And it's also difficult to comment or speculate about how our last 8 years of superior performance for them would weigh into their consideration relative to making an award decision. They clearly set out a set of criteria in their request for proposals, and we responded. And we certainly would like to believe that our incumbent performance would matter to them and there would be some value given to the cost to switch. However, we can't control any of those decisions. All we can do is provide great performance on the metrics that we do have control over and hope that they're valued by any customer at any time they're making a decision to either stay or go. So I wish I could be more specific about it or more optimistic or pessimistic. You should take this as a completely neutral comment. I really don't know how to handicap this one.
Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Right. Still thinking by the end of the year? I know they said at least early January.
John H. Hammergren: Yes, and we don't control it either, Larry. As you know, we certainly would -- and if it follows last or the last pattern, it would be sometime before the end of the year, and it could come this -- anytime. But we're -- we've given them all the information they need to make their decision and it's in their hands.
Operator: Our next question will come from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just looking at the back half guidance and some of the color you gave around 4Q, it looks like 3Q will actually be quite a bit lower than 2Q and lower than our expectations. Just thinking about that against some of the key generic launches that we should see in your fiscal 3Q, I was hoping maybe you could just help us reconcile maybe why 3Q would be below 2Q and obviously below 4Q.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Yes, it's really a function of about 3 things. First off, just the timing this year, as we sit here in October, of when the branded manufacturer compensation is coming to us will mean a significant sequential decline in the December quarter, and then January is generally the biggest quarter. So that's the first driver. The second thing is while you're correct that certainly, Lipitor launching November 30 will help, that's only 1 month of their quarter. It'll be much more important than the March quarter. And on the Specialty generics side, sequentially you have a couple of important drugs that will be entering a little less profitable part of their lifespan. And so that'll be a sequential drop from September to December. And third, as we just look at the way the implementation schedule has worked out in our hospital software business, we'd expect the December quarter to be down a little bit sequentially and then the March quarter to pop back up. You also had a -- in our payer-facing technology business, a pretty sizable disease management contract that we were winding up with the State of Illinois. We had expected to see that sequentially or fairly steadily recognized throughout the year, but we reached settlement with them, which pulled essentially the whole year into the September quarter. So that's the last component of why the sequential drop that you're describing is nothing to be concerned about. It's just sort of the way that the timing of these couple of issues has worked out this fiscal year.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. And then, Jeff, just one more on the back half. You mentioned the Lipitor. Obviously, there's been some speculation around different PBM strategies around Lipitor. I was wondering if you could provide some insight to how you guys are thinking about the generic launch of Lipitor today. And is there any reason for concern around your expectations for generic penetration relative to a typical generic launch?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Obviously, it is a big drug, and there's a lot of work being done on many parties' [ph] parts to make sure that this is handled properly. I think the view we had at the beginning of the fiscal year is still the view that we have today, and I would say that the economics we believed at that time that would fall to McKesson continue to be the economics we believed way back when we gave guidance for the fiscal year. So clearly, there's a little bit of noise in the channel around various alternatives that people might be pursuing. But as it relates to at least our business, I think we're still pretty confident that it'll fall, like we believed that it would.
Operator: We'll go to George Hill from Citi.
George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: A lot my basic ones have been answered. John, could you maybe talk a little bit on the -- talk a bit about on the HCIT side? You guys started to see some pull-through with respect to the clinical functionality, and McKesson has a pretty large footprint with respect to financial tools. Has the company had any conversations in hospitals yet about the need for ICD-10 upgrades? And can you talk about what that opportunity can look like?
John H. Hammergren: Well, I think everybody's concerned about ICD-10 upgrades, and I think we have an action plan with almost all of our -- in fact, all of our customers. We've had a discussion with them, and most of them are already building the implementation plans to make sure their products are ICD-10 compliant and ready. And it goes to the payer business as well and not just the hospital business. So it's a pretty significant change for our industry. It's consuming a whole bunch of resource when there's not a lot of resource available. But we would expect that not only will all of our products be ICD-10 compliant and ready, but our customers will hopefully be ready as well, and that's what we're working on. So that's part of the momentum we see in the business also.
Operator: Next we'll hear from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa C Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I just had a couple of follow-up questions. Jeff, on Lipitor, when you contemplated Lipitor in your guidance last year, were you expecting that Ranbaxy was going to launch? Or were you always anticipating that there potentially would only be one manufacturer? How should we think about that?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, when we -- as a reminder, Lisa, what we said is our basic assumption was the November launch with 2 players. We weren't speculating on who those players might be or how they get to market. That remains our assumption. Certainly, there's an almost infinite number of scenarios that are out there. But I think we feel confident within the kind of guidance range we've given you for the year. As we look at the landscape right now, we're pretty comfortable with our assumptions and what's built into our forecast.
John H. Hammergren: And I'll also say, Lisa, I think it's also important to know that these are -- this is a big product, but we also have a portfolio of margin that comes in not only from generics but also from branded companies. And if our speculation on Lipitor happened to be slightly off one direction or the other, I'm not sure that it would have a significant impact on our company, particularly with the fact that this is mostly an FY '13 opportunity for McKesson given that it falls late in our fiscal year. So I don't -- we're not particularly stressed by the various speculation that's out there and what it might do. Now clearly, they can be significantly different than what we think.
Lisa C Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then just one other thing. I know, Jeff, you normally don't like to give quarterly guidance. But based on the fact that we know now 2 quarters and you've given us some indication on the fourth quarter, just coming back to the third quarter if I do the math around the range, you're in essence saying that it would be flat year-over-year. Is there anything specific to this quarter or perhaps maybe some of the price increases that you saw on branded inflation where they pulled forward? Is there something that got pulled forward from the third quarter to the second quarter? How should we think about that?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Yes, there's about 4 components that explain the sequential move down from the September quarter. One is just the pattern this year of the -- when branded price increases are coming in. Second, on the Specialty generic side, you actually have a couple of large drugs that are entering the less profitable part of their life cycle in the December quarter. Third, you had a large disease management contract in our payer-facing business with the State of Illinois that we settled completely and, therefore, had a large drop to the bottom line in the September quarter. But that was something we had expected to see in the back half of the year. And then last, just the way that the implementations are playing out in our MPT or hospital-facing business, the December quarter will be the weakest quarter of the year and then March will pop back up. So those are really things, none of which has anything to do with the fundamental outlook for the year. It's just the way the timing has evolved.
Operator: From Deutsche Bank, we'll go to Ross Muken.
Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So as we look at the balance sheet, I mean, you've obviously amassed a pretty big cash hoard here. And certainly, you guys have been excellent historically on the capital deployment side. I mean, as you think about sort of where -- how you're prioritizing kind of uses of capital at this point given, one, where the stock is trading and, two, sort of the M&A environment, which should kind of come into your favor with the market multiple and valuations pulling in, how are you thinking about deployment? And how do you see multiples from the M&A standpoint kind of come into that degree? Or do you still see some parts where things are fairly frothy?
John H. Hammergren: Well, I think it's a good question, Ross. We have a -- we do have a significant opportunity in front of us to more deploy our balance sheet in a way that delivers incremental value for all of our shareholders. And I would imagine, consistent with our past practice, we will continue to take a portfolio approach, which includes clearly share repurchases that we talked about this quarter, and continue the acquisitions and, of course, our dividend policy at this point. So I don't think it'll be a change from what we've done before. We'll be -- you can control share repurchases -- purchases and dividends. In some respects, acquisitions kind of follow their own course, and opportunities come and go depending on value, as you point out, and multiples of frothiness, but also in terms of willing sellers and our view of our team's ability to get the appropriate synergies and value out of any transaction. So it's a multi-pronged approach when you analyze acquisitions. And I think we still believe there are targets out there for us to continue to follow. And as you mentioned, if multiples contract, it makes those targets even more interesting to us. So I think it'll be more of what you've seen.
Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And just quickly on -- from a size basis, if we were to see something more sizable, say, north of $500 million, would you assume that would be more likely to occur in the traditional Distribution business or in the Technology business where you've been doing more tuck-ins?
John H. Hammergren: No, I don't want you to misread this comment. I don't think we necessarily look at it based on our business segments. We look at it based on the myriad of factors we evaluate any acquisition on. Is it a business we know and understand? Does it strategically position us in a better place? Is the price reasonable from a financial perspective? How much dependence do we have on synergies? How much of those synergies are we giving back to the seller? And can we deliver value? Is it going to have the right characteristics, providing returns above our cost of capital, obviously. And the returns, frankly, over time, that should be far superior to a share repurchase, which is more simple to execute. So I think we look at it on that composite way. Having said all of that, most acquisitions in the technology space, particularly like hospital software companies, at $500 million or above would carry a multiple that would immediately stop us from going down that path. Having said that, I'm not sure that those multiples will hold after this buy cycle is done and people begin to look at other opportunities to spend their money. We think McKesson is very well positioned with our portfolio of technology companies to take advantage of the buying that will continue, like connectivity and transaction process and the kinds of things that are core to our business. And perhaps those companies that are dependent on single applications where the buying cycle may be less predictive -- predictable, those valuations could soften, so.
Operator: Next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I have a couple of follow-up questions. First of all, Jeff, on State of Illinois, can you quantify database management payments because I might have missed it?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: I don't think we gave a precise number, but I suppose the way I would think about it is this is revenue that pretty much drops straight to the bottom line and it added a couple of pennies to our earnings this quarter. And we thought instead what it would be doing would be adding a little less than $0.01 throughout each of the quarters of the rest of the year.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And then, John, you mentioned before that Lipitor contribution is going to be more significant for you in fiscal year '13. I mean, fiscal year '12 has 4 months of exclusivity versus 2 in fiscal year '13. So should we interpret your comment as Lipitor during multisource period being just more profitable for you than a usual, multisource-type drug?
John H. Hammergren: I think it's difficult to predict at any one drug what its profitability might be in one period versus another. I think we just look at it in a simple way than this. We're going to have more months in fiscal '13 to sell a product. It'll be in our plan -- in our business for a full year as opposed to only a partial year. And Lipitor is not the only drug, obviously, that's going to go through this cycle. So fiscal '13, frankly, will be a better year on generics because of that cycle, at least our fiscal '13. So each one of our companies in our sector have different fiscal years, and you're going to get different views on the product based on perhaps a person's view of the fiscal years. But that was it -- I was not trying to make a call on its profitability past exclusivity.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then just the last one is on the contribution from the new client win in the quarter that you mentioned in the prepared remarks. Can you just clarify to us? I mean, you've had phenomenal growth on the top line for drug distribution especially in light of the utilization environment. So when we think about that growth, like what percent came from that new client win in the quarter? And then should I think about the remaining of the growth really coming from just that branded price inflation that was stronger in the quarter? Is that a good way to think about it?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Well, I guess, Ricky, what I would say is the warehouse revenues would have been pretty flat year-over-year without the new customer. On the direct revenues side, the -- it's really just strong performance across all customer segments, and new business did not play the material role that it did play on the warehouse side.
Operator: We'll go to Eric Coldwell from Robert W. Baird.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Kind of a complex question, but I'm looking at some of the details you provided on OpEx and stripping out US Oncology and the selling day comparisons. A quick message is that OpEx in total is growing at about half the rate of, of course, same-day revenue. And I guess the question here is, is that leverage, that favorable trend, is that something that's sustainable? Or are you perhaps getting some additional benefit in the near term because of the strengths in branded and generic pricing, timing pull-forward, the sweet spot on some generics, et cetera? I guess what I'm trying to think of overall is OpEx as a percent of revenue on same-store, same-day basis and how much room we have left there.
John H. Hammergren: Well, clearly, our expectation is that our business will continue to drive efficiencies and that we should be able to grow OpEx slower than we grow revenues. Okay? Clearly, there's a crossover point. Particularly, if you think about the business less from a revenue perspective but from a gross margin or gross profit dollar growth perspective, that leverage should be retained. And as you think about the generic wave, our revenues may come under some pressure, but our gross profits shouldn't. And if we can keep growing our gross profits at or above the rates of our expenses, then we're going to get a very positive lift right to the bottom line. So that's the model. There's nothing in the model that should be changing going forward. And clearly, to the extent that there's inflation that's added into the model and it's something you don't have to add expense against, then that's certainly a helpful force. But I don't think the efficiency we've gained at McKesson is over yet.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Yes, that's great. I guess really, what I'm trying to drive to is that you've just done a really phenomenal job on this, and I want to make sure that we're not so hung up on generics, timing and pricing and specific drugs coming to the market that we lose sight of maybe future investments that might be needed in the core distribution platform, and whether we should be thinking about any future repositionings or growth in the distribution network, for example, things of that sort, especially given the strong top line growth you have.
John H. Hammergren: Well, I think we believe strongly that our model for 178 years is for us to deploy capital smartly in our distribution network to keep it contemporary and efficient. But we don't typically go to massive re-works to try to catch up with the productivity issues we haven't addressed. And so every year, we're investing in our capabilities and sequentially going through our network to make sure that its world class. And I think you'll see that continue. And we want to stay ahead of the expense pressures by producing leverage in our business through productivity and Six Sigma and Lean and lots of other things we think we have done a great job of rolling out. And those opportunities to reduce variability in our operation and to improve our efficiency have by no means been exhausted. And Paul Julian and the team and all of our distribution businesses have been, I think, really focusing on continuing the string of 11 years of investing in our business with the people and the systems to improve our results.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: That's great.
Operator: And we have time for one final question, and that'll come from A.J. Rice with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Albert J. Rice - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Just asking, obviously, about the trends in the medical-surg business. I guess even if you x out the 5 percentage point benefit from the 5 days, you've seen a sequential increase there. Can you comment on sort of the underlying, what you're seeing medical utilization-wise and whether we're seeing some stabilization to pickup there? And I think there was a comment about flu vaccine, that you've seen some early shipments there. What is your expectation for flu vaccine this year versus last year and timing versus the next 2 quarters?
John H. Hammergren: Well, I think our Medical-Surgical business continues to perform well. I think that we have had some positive flu this year, but I would say that it's not really an abnormal flu season. Our strength really has been across the board in our med-surg business. Brian Tyler was the President of that business until we brought him back to San Francisco to lead our Pharmaceutical distribution business. And Brian and the team at med-surg really built momentum around the products and solutions that we bring to our customers. And their -- that business is an example where I believe we are gaining incremental momentum in the marketplace and growing faster than the market because our solution set with our customers is more attractive. In particular, our long-term care business has been growing very nicely there. Our home care business. And even in the physician business, we have not seen the softness in utilization that some people have been concerned about. And perhaps it's because we're growing our penetration of our existing customers, particularly with things like McKesson brand, which carry significant operating opportunity for us to improve our margins and provide a better product at a better price to our customers. So almost without exception, as you dig under the covers of that business, we've performed well there, and I think we got a good team with the right strategy. I want to thank you, operator, and all of you on the call today for your time. We've had a very solid first half, and I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. I'm now going to hand the call over to Ana to talk about our upcoming events for the financial community. Ana?
Ana Schrank: Thanks, John. I have a preview of upcoming events. On November 10, we'll present at the Credit Suisse healthcare conference in Phoenix. On November 16, we'll present at the Lazard Capital Markets Healthcare Conference in New York. On January 9, we'll present at the J.P. Morgan healthcare conference in San Francisco. We will release third quarter earnings results in late January. We look forward to seeing you at one of these upcoming events. Thanks, and goodbye.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Ana Schrank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Ana Schrank: Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2012 First Quarter Earnings Call. With me today are John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and Jeff Campbell, our CFO. John will first provide a business update and will then introduce Jeff, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After Jeff's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after 1 hour at 6:00 Eastern time.  Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, in which we exclude from our GAAP financial results, acquisition-related expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and certain litigation reserve adjustments. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide useful information for investors. Please refer to our press release announcing first quarter fiscal 2012 results available on our website for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thanks, and here is John Hammergren.
John Hammergren: Thanks, Ana and thanks, everyone for joining us on our call. Today, we reported a strong start to fiscal 2012, with total company revenues of $30 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.27. This performance was the result of solid contributions from both Technology Solutions and Distribution Solutions and was helped by our acquisition of US Oncology, which has given us one of the most comprehensive service offerings available to a large and fast growing segment in the healthcare industry, Specialty Distribution and Services. Our first quarter performance positions us well for the remainder of the fiscal year. Due to a reduction in our estimated full year tax rate, we have raised our annual guidance assumption and now expect adjusted earnings between $6.09 and $6.29 per diluted share. Before I turn the call over to Jeff for a detailed review of our financial results, I will provide some highlights from both segments of our business.  Distribution Solutions started the year with solid revenue and gross profit growth, keeping in mind that in last year's first quarter, U.S. Pharmaceutical benefited from a $51 million antitrust settlement. The U.S. Pharmaceutical team did a great job controlling cost in the first quarter, which resulted in relatively flat expenses in this business. It's still very early in our fiscal year but we remain confident in our expectations. We anticipate generics will be a strong driver of our full year financial results, though as we've discussed, heavily weighted to the back half of the fiscal year due to the launch calendar. We also expect that our broad range of value-added services for branded manufacturers should continue to contribute to steady levels of compensation. We continue to build new service offerings that create demonstrated value for our large Retail National Accounts, as well as our independent customers.  Recently, our U.S. Pharmaceutical business held its annual trade show for independent retail customers. Thousands of pharmacy owners gathered in our hometown of San Francisco to learn more about the latest industry developments. During the event, we shared our vision to further strengthen the role of independent pharmacists, who are vital members of America's evolving healthcare system. We unveiled a number of innovative and integrated solutions, including our mobile messaging solution and our physician outreach program, to help independents become more integrated with patients and providers in their communities. At the conference, we demonstrated how McKesson's technology and clinical solutions work hand-in-hand. By using technology to become more efficient, pharmacists can free up their time to focus on delivering valuable clinical services that help their patients lead healthier lives.  We were also able to leverage our vision center, located here at corporate headquarters, to further showcase McKesson's full complement of solutions for the healthcare industry. Many of these solutions are integrated for members of our Health Mart franchise, which received recognition from Consumer Reports and J.D. Power and Associates for its outstanding customer service this year and was announced as the Chain of the Year by Drug Store News during the trade show. We also previewed our new store-branded line of over-the-counter products for Health Mart, which we'll launch this fall. Our Health Mart franchise has approximately 2,800 stores and is growing. We believe Health Mart is a critical part of our solution set because it offers our independent pharmacy customers an effective way to successfully compete against larger national players. Now let me turn to our Specialty business and in particular, US Oncology. We've made great progress integrating the legacy McKesson assets with our US Oncology business. We have a cross-functional team in place to manage the integration, and we are right on track with our plans. When you think about oncologists today, they are under tremendous pressure to deliver more cost-effective care while adhering to best practice protocols. We believe this is going to lead to the development of integrated care models, the transition of reimbursement risk to providers and an increased need to manage operating costs. Our broad solution set, which includes distribution services and integrated technology offering, best practices and managed care contracting, and a full suite of practice management solutions, helps enable the success of our oncology customers. With McKesson, an oncologist can elect to have a simple distribution or GPO relationship, a more comprehensive practice management relationship or choose something in between. Our offering is attractive because of the breadth of the alternatives available to our customers.  Specialty has had good overall performance this quarter. While the team is very focused on the integration, they've continued to execute on the core business with good success on all dimensions, in particular with generics and a growing pipeline of prospective customers. Turning to our Medical-Surgical business. We are really pleased that revenues were up 7% for the first quarter, primarily due to strong growth in our physician office business, resulting from acquiring new customers and further penetration of our existing customer base. We remain focused on optimizing our sourcing of McKesson branded products to drive margin expansion.  In our Canadian Distribution business, we performed as we expected in the first quarter, with flat revenues on a constant currency basis due to the impact of the government-imposed price restrictions on generic drugs. The team continues to work on mitigating the impact by focusing on generic compliance gains with customers and capitalizing on global sourcing of branded and generic pharmaceuticals. In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of our Distribution Solutions segment. The scale and efficiency across our distribution businesses allows us to serve our customers with a high degree of satisfaction. With our successful proprietary generics program, we are well positioned to benefit from a period of significant generic product introductions. We have also enhanced our overall value proposition with the US Oncology acquisition, which gives us a strong position in the fastest-growing sector of the market, specialty distribution. And our Medical-Surgical business is growing and generating solid financial results. We're off to a solid start and we're confident that the rest of the year will show strong growth. Turning now to Technology Solutions. I'm pleased with our performance across the segment and in particular, with the steady progress in our McKesson provider technology business, which drove improvement in our revenues and operating margins. As we said during our fiscal year-end call, our near-term priority is our customers' success. And right now, we are laser-like focused on getting our provider customers installed and eligible for the government's Meaningful Use incentives.  In the first quarter, our operating results were strong, aided by all of the changes we've made in this business. In addition, our results came in a little better than expected, mainly from hitting certain implementation milestones and the timing of payments from customers. While we are encouraged by these achievements, we have not changed our full year view of Technology Solutions.  In addition to the progress in provider technologies, 2 of our other businesses in this segment, our payer-facing health solutions business and our RelayHealth Connectivity business showed steady results year-over-year in the June quarter.  We recently completed our acquisition of Portico, which will be integrated into our payer business. Portico adds integrated provider management including value-based reimbursement solutions to the McKesson portfolio. These solution capabilities will help automate network management, provider enrollment, contracting and pricing. Health reform is bringing payment and delivery model changes, such as accountable care and bundled payments. In this environment, payers and providers must deepen their clinical and financial alignment to ensure optimal outcomes at the right cost. Our strong Health Solutions portfolio includes products to help guide decision-making, the delivery of care and the final transaction processing. Combined with Portico systems, our broad offering will help payers and care providers create new products that use value reimbursement to align payers and providers on achieving the right outcomes. The combination will also help us drive significant administrative cost reductions by enabling clients to optimize and manage their networks efficiently and enable new complex reimbursement models. The acquisition of Portico, along with our acquisition of System C, a U.K-based company that offers a suite of patient administrative systems and clinical solutions, fits nicely with our overall strategy in Technology Solutions. We have a comprehensive set of products and services to help providers reduce costs while maintaining quality, safety and efficiency through automation and connectivity. In summary, we're off to a good start in fiscal 2012. In addition to solid operating performance, our strong balance sheet and steady cash flow provide us with opportunities to deploy capital and in the first quarter, we executed a $650 million accelerated share repurchase program. Overall, I believe we're well positioned for continued success.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, and will return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?
Jeffrey Jeff: Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. McKesson delivered strong financial results this quarter, laying a solid foundation for the remainder of the fiscal year. My comments today will focus on our $1.27 adjusted earnings per share, which as you recall from our discussion in May excludes 3 things: acquisition-related expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and litigation reserve adjustments, of which there are none this quarter.  The numbers I'll review in my discussion can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 included in today's press release. I'll begin with our consolidated results for the quarter, which can be found on Schedule 2. Total revenues were $30 billion for the quarter, up 9% from the prior year. Excluding the impact of the US Oncology acquisition that we completed last December, total revenues increased 6% for the quarter. We are pleased to that both our Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions segments contributed nicely to this growth.  Adjusted gross profit for the quarter increased 8% versus last year. As a reminder, the prior year benefited from a positive $51 million antitrust settlement, which flowed through the gross profit line. Excluding both the impact of US Oncology this year and the prior-year antitrust settlement, overall adjusted gross profit would have increased 6% for the quarter versus last year. Total adjusted operating expenses were up 10% to $984 million for the quarter. US Oncology represented half of this total increase, in line with our original expectations. Now before I move on, I want to take a minute to clarify in a little bit more detail how US Oncology has been incorporated into the McKesson financial statements, particularly as it relates to cost of sales and operating expenses classification. Prior to the acquisition by McKesson, US Oncology recognized certain expenses on the cost of sales line in its income statement that are now reported in our McKesson results as operating expenses. These expenses generally run $20 million to $25 million a quarter and primarily relate to employee compensation and benefit costs, reclassified as operating expenses. So if you think about this for the first quarter, total US Oncology adjusted operating expenses were approximately $44 million, with roughly $20 million to $25 million of these expenses being previously classified as cost of sales in the US Oncology income statements. Next, other income was relatively unchanged from the prior year. Interest expense increased by $21 million to $64 million this quarter, primarily due to the debt we put in place as a result of the US Oncology acquisition. Our full year assumption of $260 million of interest expense in fiscal 2012 remains unchanged. Moving down the P&L to taxes. As you saw in our press release today, we have lowered our full year estimate of the tax run rate from 33% to 32%, as our estimate of the full-year sources of our earnings has changed. I would remind you that our tax rate is very sensitive to relatively small changes in our sources of income. So while 32% is our best estimate as of this quarter, the rate could vary from time to time.  Adjusted net income in the quarter was $323 million, up 3% from the prior year. And moving now to share count. While this past year, we completed our largest acquisition in over a decade, the $2.1 billion US Oncology acquisition, we've also done over $2.7 billion of share repurchases over the past 5 quarters. This resulted in our diluted weighted average shares outstanding coming in at 254 million for the quarter, down 7% from the prior year. With respect to full year share count, as discussed at our Investor Day in June, we continue to expect our full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding to come in at our original guidance of 253 million shares. Our first quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $1.27, an increase of 9% compared to last year's adjusted EPS of $1.16.  Now for those of you who follow us closely, I will be the first to admit that this year-over-year growth performance is more than up modestly versus last year's first quarter baseline of $1.03, which is what we directionally guided to back in May on our earnings call and again, at our Investor Day in June.  Since then, there were 2 key drivers that led to this better-than-expected strong financial performance. First, and most significantly, as you know, the end of the quarter is very important to us in Technology Solutions depending on what implementation milestones we hit and the timing of customer payments. The good news is that we made stronger-than-expected progress in the last few weeks of the quarter in both of these areas, and both of these items drive revenue recognition, as reflected in our results. Second, our estimate of our sources of income evolved a bit as we closed our books, resulting in a favorable reduction of our full year tax run rate, as I mentioned earlier. This had some impact, of course, in the June quarter.  Let's now move on to our segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3. Distribution Solutions, overall revenue increased 9% versus the prior year, with US Oncology contributing 3% to this year-over-year growth. Looking at the components, direct revenues were up 11% for the quarter. If you exclude the impact of US Oncology, our first quarter direct revenues grew a solid 7%, primarily driven by market growth and our mix of business. Warehouse revenues increased 3% from a year ago, benefiting from revenues associated with a new customer.  Canadian revenues on a constant currency basis were flat for the quarter, in line with our original expectations, as John said. Including a favorable currency impact, revenues increased 7% versus the prior year. Government-imposed price reductions on generics in certain provinces will continue to impact the revenue growth in our Canadian business throughout this fiscal year.  Medical-Surgical revenues were up a strong 7% for the quarter to $731 million, driven by increased volume from new and existing customers. Adjusted gross profit for this segment increased 6% for the quarter to $1.1 billion. If you exclude the impact of the US Oncology acquisition this year and the prior year antitrust settlement, Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit would be up roughly 3%. Distribution Solutions adjusted operating expense was up 12% to $622 million for the quarter, and excluding US Oncology, operating expense increased just 4% versus last year. Adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 176 basis points, which is flat year-over-year when you exclude prior year antitrust settlement.  Given the quarterly variability in this segment, we always focus, as you know, on full year margins. In this context, for full-year fiscal 2012, we continue to expect adjusted operating margin improvement in the high single-digit basis points.  In summary, we're pleased with the solid first quarter performance in Distribution Solutions. Turning now to Technology Solutions. Total revenues were up 6% to $802 million for the quarter, aided by some of the timing issues John and I have now both discussed. For the full year, we continue to expect Technology Solutions revenue growth to increase modestly from last year's 2% growth. Adjusted gross profit in the segment grew 16% versus the prior year to $383 million. Contributing to this result is the revenue recognition timing we have discussed, much of which drops almost straight through to the bottom line. Technology Solutions had total gross R&D spending for the quarter of $105 million, flat with the prior year. Of this amount, we capitalized 10% compared to 14% a year ago. Our Technology Solutions adjusted operating profit was up 49% versus a year ago to $119 million. Adjusted operating margin in the segment was up to 14.84% for the quarter compared to 10.54% in the prior year.  We are pleased with this margin expansion, although it was partly driven by the revenue recognition timing we've discussed. For the full year, we continue to expect our adjusted operating margin to be in the low end of our long-term Technology Solutions adjusted operating margin goal range of mid-teens. Leaving our segment performance and turning now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. Our receivables were $9.4 billion, up from the prior year balance of $7.8 billion and our days sales outstanding increased by 2 days to 25 days. Inventories increased just 1% to $9.5 billion, while our payables increased 9% to $14.5 billion. So our days sales and inventory of 30 days is down 3 days from a year ago, while our days sales and payables was flat at 46 days. These working capital metrics resulted in us generating $326 million in operating cash flow for the quarter. This is in line with our expectations. And for the full year, we continue to expect to generate approximately $2 billion in cash flow from operations. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.1 billion, down from our year-end balance of $3.6 billion. This obviously leaves us well positioned to create shareholder value through the use of our portfolio approach to capital deployment, as demonstrated in the first quarter when we completed a $650 million accelerated share repurchase, closed the System C acquisition and increased our dividend. Capitalized spending was $109 million for the quarter and we continue to expect full year capitalized spending between $450 million to $500 million.  Now I'll turn to our outlook. As John mentioned earlier, due to the change in our estimated full year tax rate, we are raising our guidance on adjusted earnings from $5.99 to $6.19 to a new range of $6.09 to $6.29. As we have discussed, we have now closed both the System C and Portico acquisitions since the beginning of the fiscal year, which drives the modest change in our guidance assumptions of $0.47 for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and $0.07 for acquisition-related expenses.  In summary, we continue to feel McKesson is on track to have another good year.  Thanks and with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions]. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Ross Muken, Deutsche Bank.
Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG: So when you think about the USO asset, now that you've owned it for some time, and you look at sort of the relative performance and the synergy capture that you've enjoyed, where have you been most pleasantly surprised or in general surprised with sort of the asset? And in terms of looking at other potential uses and other disease areas or other places you could take some of the service model offerings that, that asset brings, what else have you sort of discovered you could potentially do with it over time to kind of create value at a higher margin?
John Hammergren: Well, thanks for the question, Ross. This is John. I think that we are very pleased that we made the acquisition, and it's certainly progressing as we had planned. I think that the areas of focus or highlight I would say are that our employees, on both sides of the fence, have done a great job of getting together, both culturally as well as from a business operations perspective. US Oncology folks fit right in with the McKesson teams, and we're doing a good job of executing and organizing, so that we can continue to show success in this segment and drive value for our customers, most important. I think that the other areas of highlight would be that the customers, whether they're existing McKesson customers or US Oncology customers, sort of got the transaction right out of the gate. And whether they were a customer where we had a large management relationship or whether it was just a distribution customer, people seem to understand the synergies that we bring to both parties and are attracted to a model where they have the ability to, over time, continue to build out a value proposition with us that will improve the operating efficiencies of the practice, as well as improve the quality of clinical care provided. So in a myriad of dimensions, I think people get it and they're excited about it. And we are, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, seeing increased interest from a customer funnel perspective and exploring opportunities, either to migrate up, as the existing customer would from a basic distribution relationship, up the value chain or actually being attracted as a new net customer into our network. As it relates to other practice opportunities, clearly US Oncology over more than a decade has been building out a skill set that has been refined, both from a business model perspective and also from a financial and clinical perspective that will be applicable, we believe, to other clinical care areas or perhaps international opportunities. But I have to say right now, we're really focused on executing against the opportunity that's in front of us in oncology here in the United States and we plan to continue to do that, but we do think there are applications in other areas.
Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG: And maybe quickly just on the technology business, the margin has been sort of hovering here around the high 14s, low 15s on an adjusted basis for a couple of quarters. So I dare say we're sort of at a place of stability. I mean it feels like -- Pat's got a pretty good handle on sort of the trajectory of the business. What's sort of the next big steps there in terms of kind of driving incremental EBIT and growth?
John Hammergren: Well, I think we have made significant progress in the business. We made lots of changes last year, and we have done a lot of investment in the product to make sure the product is world-class. And we'll be ready for the Meaningful Use kinds of evaluations that will be necessary with our customers. I would say that our focus though right now is to make sure that our customers are migrating to our most recent platforms that will be required for Meaningful Use and our focus really is on implementation. Beyond that, you noticed in this quarter, we are continuing to build out our other business offerings. We acquired a company into our payer business called Portico, which we think will position us very well for the way healthcare is reforming in front of us, so that the payers and providers can connect together in a more complete way and deliver value that has a better transparency around cost and quality and more accountability for that care that's shared between the payers and the providers. And so we're excited about that. And clearly, we're continuing to make progress in the U.K., and this acquisition of System C will allow us to build out our offering there. So albeit, the big hospital systems business that we have in the U.S. is an important part of our focus. And implementation is the highlight there. We are continuing to strategically position the business for continued growth.
Operator: Up next, we'll take Robert Willoughby, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Robert Willoughby: Just one question. John or Jeff, I guess you got still a substantial bundle of cash overseas. Assuming something favorable at some point in our lifetime happens in D.C. here, what would the plans be for any cash you'd repatriate in?
John Hammergren: Well, I think we've done a very good job of optimizing the performance of our company in a way that takes advantage of the best practice around the area of cash management. And we believe that the offshore cash is a significant source of value and properly deployed. Our shareholders will realize that value. It's requiring us to be a bit patient, both in terms of evaluating what might happen politically and with our tax code. But we also believe there are opportunities, as Systems C showed in a small way, that we can deploy the cash also to acquisitions, which can create value. So we have a keen awareness that we're getting very low returns on that offshore cash, but we're also a little reluctant I think to bring it back and take the tax effect that would be required to bring it back into the U.S. at this point.
Operator: Up next, we'll hear from Glen Santangelo, Credit Suisse.
Glen Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG: Jeff, I just wanted to follow-up on some of the comments you were giving us on the Distribution Solutions segment. You gave us a lot of detail, excluding US Oncology and kind of backing out the litigation settlement from last year, and I'm trying to do the math. Could you just help me figure out where exactly the gross margins were this year versus last year in the op margins if I were to back out US Oncology in the game last year?
Jeffrey Jeff: Right. It's a good question, Glen. And I guess to simplify, when you do that backing out, you'll see that the gross profit growth, if you take US Oncology out of this year and the $51 million good guy antitrust settlement out of last year, you'll see the gross margin is down a little bit year-over-year. And there's always some variability in 2 things, of course, in our Distribution segment that drive big dollars. One is the timing of how and when we get paid by our branded manufacturing partners and the part of the impact you see in this year's June quarter is the fact that the March quarter was a particularly robust quarter. I won't go into the arcana of how all these agreements work, but that has some effect on the following quarter. We think we're right on track though, as we look at the full year. Similarly, on the generic side, as John talked about, we have, this fiscal year, a more back-end loaded generic launch calendar. And so while we were pleased with the performance of our generic businesses, both in our traditional U.S. pharma business and in our specialty business in the June quarter, on a year-over-year basis, you didn't see the kind of growth from a full year perspective we continue to expect. So that's why, while the gross margin is down a little bit year-over-year when you look at the 2 June quarters, we continue to be comfortable with our full-year assumption that the operating margin expansion in that segment should be in the high single-digit basis points.
Glen Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay. That's fair. Was the operating profit margins down a little bit as well? Or did they expand a little bit?
Jeffrey Jeff: Well, they're about flat. We didn't do the full math for you, Glen, of pulling the USON profits up.
Glen Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay, that's fine. I was just trying to get a sense for what happened in the base business. But that's helpful.
Operator: Our next question today will come from Larry Marsh, Barclays Capital.
Lawrence Marsh - Barclays Capital: I wanted to clarify, if I could, the variation in the quarter. Going back to your "up modestly" comments, Jeff. You'd mentioned that technology timing and payments and the tax rate, but it seems like if you add those together that's maybe a $20 million, $25 million delta, and I'm getting more like $50 million to $60 million. So I just want to make sure, is there any other good guy in the quarter versus your expectation to help us understand the quarter and why we should pull that out for the rest of the year? And then just on the tax rate, I know it's hard to predict over a longer period of time, but just for purposes of modeling, is it fair to say like anything else that 32% is a fair kind of go-forward rate over a longer period of time? Or do we think of that as a one-year phenomenon?
Jeffrey Jeff: Well, couple of good questions there, Larry. In terms of surprise versus what we believed at the time, say mid-June, when we did Investor Day. I suppose first off, the size of the gap depends a little bit on what your baseline is and what you think up modestly was. I'll tell you for us, the surprise was probably a little smaller in dollars than what you suggested, but the Technology Solutions implementation, timelines and the customer payments that we hit that was a very material move because as I explained, that's revenue that when it comes, pretty much goes straight through to the bottom line. So a small amount of revenue really moves the profits. The tax rate has been a couple of pennies. And you're correct. I mean versus what we thought in mid-June, there's another couple of pennies where across the board, our other distribution and technology businesses all did a little better than we expected. Frankly, if that's all that had happened, it wouldn't be drawing our attention or your attention. It's really because of the very unexpected tax change and the very large variance in MTS that you got to the results you saw, which was probably -- in our world probably more $40 million or thereabouts better than we have been expecting. In terms of go-forward tax rate, it's always a little tough to make long-term commentaries on tax rates because -- particularly in today's political environment, who knows where the tax code is going. But what you should see over the next few years, if all else were to remain equal, is some of the lower tax sources of income that we have in our businesses we think will grow a little bit faster than our overall business. So if that were to happen and if the tax code were to change, I am hopeful that you will see that 30% inch down a little bit over time -- 32% excuse me.
Lawrence Marsh - Barclays Capital: Right. And so it just sounds like then, the first quarter good guy on timing of implementation, as you think about it, it really should kind of be pulled out in consequent quarters on technology?
Jeffrey Jeff: Yes, exactly. For now, we are not changing our full-year view of technology. Because most of what happened we had in the plan. We just didn't think it would happened in the June quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lisa Gill, JPMorgan.
Lisa Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Jeff, just to follow-up on that though, the other $40 million that was better than what you expected when we saw you in June, is there any reason why that would come out of future quarters?
Jeffrey Jeff: Well, so if you think about the 3 sources, Lisa, the biggest source of course is just the revenue recognition in MTS and that's the piece that we really did have in the plan for the year. We just didn't think it would come in June. Now the tax rate, which helped us a little bit, we gave you an increase in our guidance because, sure, that impacts the whole year and that's why we pulled the year up by the $0.10 although it rounds to more like $0.02 in the June quarter.
Lisa Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Right. Okay. I guess -- and then just my second question would just be from a strategic standpoint, when we think about healthcare IT, maybe John if you can talk about this. Are you where you want to be in that business? How do you feel about the U.S. market? You're obviously meeting the milestones so that you can start to recognize that revenue, but maybe just talk about it strategically for a minute as you look out over the next couple of years.
John Hammergren: Well, clearly, we think that technology is going to continue to be a source of opportunity as this market gets more and more automated, and the clinical side of the business is where the focus is today, primarily driven by the government's insistence that people get these systems installed and used in an appropriate way. Beyond that, there will continue to be demand for buildouts of clinical opportunities for adjacent products and other kinds of solutions and services that kind of bolt into the core clinical systems. And if you think about McKesson's customers, many of our customers from a financial perspective are running on terrific systems that we installed 20 or 25 years ago that those financial systems eventually will have to be upgraded and changed in a way that will allow them to deal with the complexity associated with the way payments are going to be delivered going forward. And one of the acquisitions we made in the quarter called Portico, for the payer side, is positioning the payer software business for that complexity. The continued development of a product called Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management would be the provider side of that improved infrastructure and architecture to manage the financial side of the house. So I think that albeit we're in a big buying cycle now on the clinical side or implementation cycle for McKesson, we do think that we will transition into a focus on the financial side as we look into that 2-year horizon.
Lisa Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And, John, just as a follow-up, I mean in the past you've talked about the fact that acquisitions are quite expensive in the market. Are you starting to see prices come down at all? Are you seeing that things are more reasonable? If we're looking at your balance sheet, you clearly have a lot of cash, and healthcare IT is a big opportunity over the next couple of years. Should we be thinking that there'll be more acquisition opportunities in that area?
John Hammergren: Well, I think there will be winners and losers that are going to shake out in this environment. And the winners I believe will be the larger IT companies that have the footprints to be the anchor tenant, so to speak, with our clients. And I'd say that's true whether it's a payer client or a provider client, whether that provider is a hospital or a physician office. And that anchor position should allow for additional pull-through opportunities and products where smaller companies or companies perhaps on the margin can't get access to the customer. So I do think there'll be more acquisition opportunities as those valuations come down as a result of the complexity of getting into the business. And sometimes, we'll pay up a little bit for acquisitions when they're small-scale like System C and Portico, where on their own from a simple DCF perspective, would probably not be worth what we paid but when you put it into our enterprise with our pull-through opportunities, those customers will allow us to have a payback on that investment for our shareholders. But speaking broadly, we're not seeing valuations drop much for the big public companies yet, and that may take some time.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: Just a question around guidance, with this stronger-than-expected performance in the first quarter, will the year be more evenly weighted between the first half and second half? Or should we still think about first half at kind of like around 40% of earnings and then second half 60%?
Jeffrey Jeff: Well, Ricky, I guess 2 comments. I don't think the pull-forward of some items that we saw pretty evenly spread through the rest of the year and our plan changes our view of the year. Of course we haven't really said anything about 40% at the first half. The only comment we've made beyond the first quarter, which certainly still holds true is we would expect the March quarter to once again be unusually strong.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: Okay. I mean I'm saying 40/60 just because when I look back historically, I mean, I think last year it was around 42/58 before. So and if this is unusually -- if the back end is unusually strong because of the generic pipeline. Because like, we're making the assumption that the first half is going to be abnormally below that. And I know that you don't give quarterly guidance, but maybe you can help me then by thinking about the drivers in next coming quarter? Well what do you think about the key drivers of the business, whether it's the benefit that you get from the pharmaceutical manufacturers that make those products. How should we think about those in this upcoming quarter?
Jeffrey Jeff: Well, Ricky as you know, the reason we don't give quarterly guidance is because you have significant quarter-to-quarter variability in the timing of when we get paid by our branded manufacturers, which we don't control. We're often a little surprised by generic launches, which we don't control. And we just demonstrated in the June quarter that in our technology business, rev rec can vary a little bit from quarter-to-quarter. So I guess I really just have to go back to -- we've given you the commentary on the fourth quarter. You've got one quarter of actual results and you've got full-year guidance that we just updated. But beyond that, boy, it's just -- I think for us to try to get more specific, would almost imply that there we know more about the timing of certain things than we in fact do.
Operator: Next we'll go to Helene Wolk, Sanford Bernstein.
Helene Wolk - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: I have a question about the IT margin expectations for the balance of the fiscal year. I guess I heard that you're expecting to get to the low end of mid-teens and yet, I'm also hearing, I think, that you pulled forward what's probably high margin business in terms of the service revenue. So what am I missing in terms of what changes in mix or otherwise that helps me get to that margin outlook for the balance of the year?
Jeffrey Jeff: Well, I think the way to think about it, Helene, at the low end of mid-teens, we'd say somewhere around 14, which is about where we were this quarter. So first thing to remember is there's significant seasonality in this business just because you have to end the sales year some time, so the March quarter tends to always be this, like quite a stretch, the strongest quarter and the highest margin. Second point I make is what we pulled forward was revenue that, in our plan for the year in our original guidance, we had later on in the year. Regardless of whether it fell later in the year or in the June quarter as it did, it was very high margin revenue. So it really doesn't change our view for the full year. So while we're pleased to get some things done with our customers more quickly than we had anticipated, we're only 90 days into the year, and it's just too early to change our view of the full year, which remains as it was.
Operator: Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs has the next question.
Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Yes, you guys hit on most of the big ones but I guess just a couple of specific follow-ups. It sounded like there was some strong performance in medical this quarter. We've heard some mixed commentary on utilization, this quarter across healthcare. I was just curious to what you guys are seeing from your medical business as far as utilization.
John Hammergren: Well, I think we probably share some of that same view that utilization and physician office visits are down slightly or certainly softer than historical. I think that we had a view going into the year that we were going to grow slightly faster than the market as a result of the strength of our value proposition for the physician practices that we focus on, and I think that, that has probably shown itself in the first quarter. So I do think we're making some progress attracting new customers to our portfolio of solutions, and we're optimistic about this business and it continues to perform well for us.
Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Great. And I guess just quickly, if there is an update on the VA contract and any expectations around timing?
John Hammergren: Yes, there is really no new update. We've submitted, as others have, I would imagine, a reply to the requests for proposals and I would imagine that's being evaluated and considered now. And we would expect, I believe, to hear late this year or early next year at December, January type of timeframe as to what the outcome of those -- government evaluation of those proposals will be. But there really is nothing new other than that.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Ransom, Raymond James.
John Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Just a couple of questions on US Oncology, can you help us, with -- just the EPS effect of that acquisition this quarter? And was it better or worse than you expected?
Jeffrey Jeff: It's pretty much tracking, John, right in line with what we expected. And the way to think about it is we gave GAAP guidance that it would be accretive, excluding the one-time costs of $0.07 to $0.08, and then the intangible amortization related to it is about $0.20. So on an adjusted EPS basis for the year, it'll be in the $0.25 to $0.30 range and we're tracking right to that.
John Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. And secondly, do you have an update on the ASP plus 6%, maybe going to ASP plus 4%? And how should we think about that if that were to occur?
John Hammergren: John, when we did the acquisition, we knew there was going to continue to be a focus and question and concern around the issue of reimbursement and we continue to focus on that as a company as well. And clearly, it's our desire to avoid any additional adjustments to the way our physician customers are reimbursed. Having said all of that, we did factor reimbursement pressure into our models when we acquired US Oncology. And in some ways, that pressure increases the interest customers might have in looking at other opportunities to improve profitability and efficiency in their practices. So I think this clearly is a concern. We don't want our physician customers to experience a reduction in reimbursement around the medication dispensing attributes of the profitability that they enjoy today but there are a lot of other ways to drive improved financial performance for these customers in addition to the markup on the product that we continue to focus on to hopefully provide. As I said, offsets that we would believe will exist as this pressure continues over time. We don't have any near-term reason to believe that any changes in ASP is likely to occur but we certainly hear the same debates that are going on in Washington, everybody else does and we're not naïve about the risk.
Operator: Up next, we'll take a question from Eric Caldwell, Baird.
Eric Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Just some clarifications on Technology Solutions. Was the implementation milestone and payment timing, were those separate events, i.e. were they separated between MPT and maybe payer solutions where you got some disease management payments, something like that? If you could give some color there. And then John, I think you've mentioned that Provider Technologies showed improvement in revenue and profitability in your prepared remarks, and I'm curious whether that would also be the case had you not seen the accelerated timing event? Just some more clarification on the underlying performance net of the obvious benefits of the implementation timing.
Jeffrey Jeff: So Eric, a couple of good questions there. So all of the revenue recognition surprises that I was talking about, both the implementation milestones that we hit, as well as the customer payments that we received, that was 100% within the MPT or hospital facing business. Across a range of product lines within that business and a range of customers, but all within MPT. The other point I might make, just to maybe clarify something I said earlier, is when you think about what surprised us versus our own perhaps expectations for the quarter, probably the total surprise to us was maybe in the $40 million range. The biggest piece of that is then, the MPT surprise I just talked about, plus you have tax and maybe a little bit across the rest of the company. In terms of how, absent the acceleration we would have done in the MTS segment, you still would have seen that business up nicely from the prior year. You just wouldn't have seen 49% operating profit growth, which is in fact what we reported.
Eric Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: That's very helpful. And I just -- if I can clarify, you said MTS would have been up regardless of the timing. Would Provider Technologies specifically have been up?
Jeffrey Jeff: Well, we don't break out the specific results of MPT.
Operator: Steve Halper, Stifel, Nicolaus is up next.
Steven Halper - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: What was the reason for the increase in the DSO by 2 days?
Jeffrey Jeff: Well, 2 things. Day of week can actually matter to us, Steve, of course because we have rather -- some rather larger customers and whether they're due to pay us on Wednesday versus Friday and when the month ends, that can vary it. But there also have been a few cases over the past year where we've made an economic decision that it's in our interest, looking at all of the aspects of a customer contract, to use our balance sheet and occasionally extend a little longer payment term. So it's a mixture of those 2 things over the past year.
Steven Halper - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then going back to the revenue recognition, I hate to beat a dead horse here on Technology Solutions. I understand the software implementations, but can you just explain the customer payment comment and how it hits revenue?
Jeffrey Jeff: Yes, that's fine. The simple answer, Steve, is that there are certain categories of customers -- particularly in a time when there are a lot of struggling hospitals in the country financially -- so there are certain customers where we don't recognize any revenue until we get the cash in the door because we perceive sufficient payment risk that it would not be conservative in terms of accounting treatment for us to recognize the revenue and then hope we get paid. So we think that's conservative and a good accounting treatment. What it does mean is when you have some good work being done by our teams and some, frankly, customers who are happy with what we're doing for them and are paying us more quickly than we thought, boy, you get revenue that just drops straight through to the bottom line.
Steven Halper - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And lastly, can you tell us which businesses you would have an arrangement with that -- like that?
Jeffrey Jeff: Well, I'm obviously -- we would never comment, Steve, on specific customers. But if...
Steven Halper - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: No, no, no not specific customer names, but what type of...
Jeffrey Jeff: Yes. These are all within the hospital facing technology business, which we would generally refer to as MPT.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: Just 2 quick ones. On the IT side, I think in the past, we've talked about maybe seeing some increased costs as you're trying to sort of do right by the customer and get things implemented. Since certain things have gone faster, should we expect a little lower cost as you get through the year even though that revenue has pulled forward? I understand that part. But should the cost basis be a little lower later?
Jeffrey Jeff: Well, not really. Tom, as John pointed out, we're very committed to continuing the progress you saw in this quarter's results on implementations. And so while we're pleased with what happened this quarter, there are no plans to back off the level of resource we currently have planned for the year.
John Hammergren: Having said that though, Tom, I do need to point out that we did make some changes last year from a cost structure perspective that we'll be rolling in on a full-year basis this year. So I think -- and that was not really in terms of R&D or implementation resources, but we did some consolidation in our overhead and our selling infrastructure last year, and we are getting the benefit of some of that as you look into the first quarter as we think about the full year. So there are some structural cost changes that have happened but it's not because we're reducing the resources we have in place to deal with these customer implementations.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: Sure. And then maybe just one other on the traditional sort of drug distribution side. I thought it was interesting, ABC this morning had pointed to certain geographies that were growing disproportionately quick, I guess, relative to some others. Do you have any areas or regions that you would point to that are growing a lot faster than the average?
John Hammergren: I have to admit I haven't really looked at it on a regional basis. I can't comment. I would imagine, though, there probably is some strength in certain states and in certain areas of the marketplace that haven't been affected by unemployment as much as others. I mean so that would -- I didn't listen to the comments but if you were to ask me, my guess would be we see some of that variability but it's more related to the condition of the market from an employment perspective than it is anything else.
Operator: Next up, we'll hear from George Hill, Citi.
George Hill - Citigroup Inc: I will start off with one on the IT side as well. John and Jeff, there's a lot of -- seems to be a lot of private assets out there available for sale now, you had mentioned the evaluation of the public companies. I guess as you look across the Technology Solutions segments, can you talk about which segments of that business are more attractive and less attractive and where might be -- attracts candidates to apply some more capital?
John Hammergren: Well it's difficult for us to talk specifically in a forum like this as to what our strategy is in terms of capital deployment. I would say, however, that we don't limit our views in terms of synergistic acquisitions to a particular segment and we're fortunate that we're in almost every segment. So whether it's a payer asset or a hospital or a physician or a connectivity type of an asset or a retail pharmacy asset, we have the ability to at least evaluate whether or not there's a strategic fit and evaluate whether the financials of the proposed acquisition provide the kind of returns that we expect on behalf of our shareholders. And so I don't think we limit our views at all. But I would say that there's a couple of quick gates we can go through to quickly dismiss an opportunity as being realistic based on the expectations of the seller, in the case of a private transaction or the public market valuations, if you think about public company transactions. We do the same thing on the distribution side. We have the ability to really look across the globe at distribution assets, and we look at the same kinds of metrics.
George Hill - Citigroup Inc: Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow-up, some of the trade group information out there on the hospital [ph] side would show that you guys had a tough year in 2010 with respect to share retention. I guess do you feel like the customer base now has stabilized given that you guys have hit some of these milestones? Or do you feel like there could still be some further weakness?
John Hammergren: Yes. we certainly -- we don't like to lose customers anywhere. And sometimes we're faced with a situation where our past performance as opposed to our current performance is a lagging issue that we have to deal with. I think that we feel really good about the quality of our current product line, the amount of money we invested in the last 2 years in our products, make those products I think competitive if not superior to many products that our competitors have in the marketplace. And I'm certainly hopeful that the market share changes that happened last year are a trailing indicator of our customers' views of us as opposed to a current indicator because we believe strongly that customers that are installing our current products are very pleased with the performance of those products largely. And we would expect that this year, our market share positions would remain solid, if not, perhaps begin to rebound slightly, particularly in the smaller marketplace where our Paragon product line is very well suited as a replacement alternative to incumbent products in a market where we have smaller share and significant opportunities to grow with a world-class product. So I think you almost have to define our technology business by product and think about our success on a product-by-product basis and that's what we try to do.
Operator: Our final question today will come from A.J. Rice, Susquehanna.
Albert Rice - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Just looking at the strength in the direct distribution and services year-to-year, I mean if you look at some of the macro-commentary, IMS would have said script trend actually moderated somewhat in the June quarter versus the March quarter. I was wondering in your 10-Q, you highlight volume growth and pricing as drivers both new customer and existing customer. Can you just maybe flesh out a little bit there of what you're seeing in terms of where the volume strength is across the board and what are you seeing on pricing?
John Hammergren: Well, I think the pricing that we're referring to is product inflation to a large extent relative to the manufacturing behavior, and we think that environment in the first quarter was strong and that's why we referred to it in our documents. I do think that we have variability on occasion in our revenue number, driven by the performance of some of our large customers and their buying behavior. And just like on the receivables side, we can have variability on the sales side if somebody decides to place an order on the last day of the quarter or that's the way thing falls, we can pick up some additional revenue. And on occasion, we will pick up a new customer. We picked up a customer last year that flowed through this business as well, so I don't think it's time for us to think about revenue above what we've already indicated for the year and this quarter just happens to be a little bit stronger than we would have expected for the full year. And we don't have a different view on the full year, A. J.
Albert Rice - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Okay. And maybe just at the Investor Day, you guys were highlighting that you'd spent a lot of time realigning the sales force at US Oncology and sort of had positioned them to go out and heavily try to build on that CSA base of the 3,000 oncologists, as well as I think you identified JVs with acute care hospitals. Are we still sort of early stages there? Is there anything you can point to in the last few months that's sort of interesting to talk about?
John Hammergren: Well, I think when I talked about my satisfaction with the US Oncology activity, I think one of the things that it points to is that we can do this integration and reorganization and not lose our sales momentum. As we do feel strongly about the fact that we have a value proposition that's resonating very well with our customers and potential customers. So I think we remain optimistic there. And I was involved in a couple of -- we were involved in a couple of activities with acute care hospitals, where US Oncology might have been a competitor or a potential competitor, and we've now combined our forces to create a solution set that fits well in an acute care community-based setting. So we've found a way I think to continue to change our value proposition so it can meet a myriad of needs and that's our focus. So thank you for that question.  I want to thank you all for your time and attention today, and clearly, it's a good start to our year. We're excited about the opportunities ahead, and I'll now turn the call over to Ana for a review of our upcoming activities for the financial community.
Ana Schrank: Thank you, John. To preview our upcoming events, on September 8, we will present at the Stifel, Nicolaus Health Care Conference in Boston. On September 14, we will present at the Morgan Stanley Conference in New York. On November 10, we will present at the Credit Suisse Health Care Conference in Phoenix. And on November 16, we will present at the Lazard Capital Markets Healthcare Conference in New York.  We will release second quarter earnings results in late October. We look forward to seeing you at one of these upcoming events. Thanks, and goodbye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation.

Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Ana Schrank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Ana Schrank: Thank you, Melissa. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2011 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. With me today are John Hammergren, McKesson's Chariman and CEO; and Jeff Campbell, our CFO. John will first provide a business update, and we'll then introduce Jeff, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After Jeff's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 6:00 Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Thanks, and here is John Hammergren.
John Hammergren: Thanks, Anna, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Our fourth quarter results wrapped up another solid full year financial performance. We finished fiscal 2011 with fourth quarter revenues up 8% to $28.9 billion and net income, up 21% to $422 million or $1.62 per diluted share. For the full year, excluding the AWP litigation charges in the second and the third quarters, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $4.86, which included $0.14 per diluted share of US Oncology acquisition-related expenses.  Operating cash flow came in at $2.3 billion this year, and clearly, our strong cash flow creates additional opportunities for the company. So I'm extremely pleased that we exceeded our initial expectations for both earnings and cash flow. We very successfully executed near-record levels of capital deployment with a good mix of acquisitions, share repurchases, internal investments and a dividend increase.  Fiscal 2011 was a big year, not just for McKesson but in the industry as well. Healthcare topics continue to drive debate in Washington and around the globe. We believe that there are issues of quality, access and cost that will remain at the center of all of the healthcare discussions. These discussions create opportunities for McKesson. Healthcare providers, manufacturers and payers are looking for broad solutions to drive improved financial, clinical and operational performance. We have the tools, services and resources to support our healthcare industry's transformation. Moving on to some of the specifics for our fourth quarter and full year. Strong execution in Distribution Solutions drove overall company results. Our team has a long history of delivering outstanding performance. This year's growth is particularly meaningful considering our excellent performance last year, driven by the H1N1 flu-related demand. Growing from last year's result was a difficult but important priority for the team. U.S. Pharmaceutical delivered terrific results across all customer segments. Better generic compliance helped drive significant growth in generics gross profit. We also performed well for our branded pharmaceutical manufacturing partners, and maintained steady levels of compensation in return.  Our deep customer relationships, operational excellence and robust generics programs and expertise in global sourcing have enabled U.S. Pharmaceutical to expand margins consistently over many years. Additionally, the team diligently managed working capital to help deliver tremendous cash flow. I believe this business is extremely well-positioned for continued industry leadership.  Included in our U.S. Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services results are the results of Specialty Care Solutions. Our acquisition of US Oncology was a major highlight of fiscal 2011. US Oncology provides one of the most comprehensive service offerings available to a large and fast-growing segment in the healthcare industry.  Last week, I was in Houston at the US Oncology headquarters, and I'm pleased to report that we have created a strong integrated management team from both organizations that is making great progress as they extend our value proposition in the oncology market. Customers at both organizations are responding positively to the acquisition. US Oncology physician and hospital customers see value in the combined companies' expanded technology platform and will benefit from a broad source of capabilities.  McKesson Specialty Care Solutions legacy customers have embraced US Oncology's broad portfolio of services, including research, payer services and revenue cycle management solutions. Manufacturers see a great opportunity in the form of a larger network, deeper clinical expertise and a broader set of data assets available from the combined organization. And patients benefit from the high-quality integrated care delivered in a community setting.  The US Oncology acquisition solidifies our strong position and is an example of our strategy to expand our product and service offering in high-growth areas of healthcare.  Turning to other businesses in the Distribution Solutions segment. Our Medical-Surgical business continues to contribute to overall success of Distribution Solutions. The team in Medical-Surgical has demonstrated strong execution and improved operating results over a multiyear period. I'm pleased with the operating leverage and efficiencies that we continue to realize across our Medical-Surgical businesses.  Finally, our Canadian Distribution business had a solid year despite regulatory changes in certain provinces that caused price reductions on generic drugs. Clearly, this created real challenges for our Canadian business, but the teams successfully mitigated the impact in fiscal 2011 by focusing on generic compliance gains with customers and capitalizing on global sourcing of branded and generic pharmaceuticals.  Looking forward to fiscal 2012, we expect to face the full year effect of the Canadian regulatory changes. Although the team is working to offset these challenges, at this point, we believe we will see a modest decline in operating profit in our Canadian Distribution business.  Overall, I'm extremely pleased with our full year performance in Distribution Solutions. Next fiscal year, we expect that when you adjust for our mix of business, revenues in our Distribution segment will grow modestly better than market rates due to the impact of the US Oncology acquisition. More importantly, we expect continued leverage in Distribution Solutions, which will result in further expansion of our operating margins. Jeff will discuss our new operating margin target range in more detail. But I'd like to highlight the key drivers of our expected margin expansion.  We expect continued strong relationships with our branded pharmaceutical manufacturing partners, where we deliver a broad range of value-added services resulting in steady compensation. In fiscal 2012, we expect branded price inflation will be at similar levels to fiscal 2011. We also expect continued progress with our Generics business, where we are well-positioned with the proprietary programs and global sourcing initiatives. We approach generics as a single company across all of our customer segments in U.S. Pharmaceutical, Canadian Distribution and our Specialty businesses.  We are headed into a year with a robust launch calendar, although it is more heavily weighted toward the back half of our fiscal year, we do expect a great performance from that business. And we also expect generic price trends will be similar to those we experienced in fiscal 2011. Although we do not call out the economics of any particular drug, some of you have asked specifically about Lipitor. Our annual earnings guidance assumes that the generic version that launches in November with 2 manufacturers.  And lastly, the US Oncology business is additive to both our margins and our earnings growth rate. Overall, we have tremendous confidence in the continued success of Distribution Solutions, and we remain steadfastly focused on delivering superior value for our customers.  Turning now to Technology Solutions. Operating profit grew 38% in our fourth quarter. In our Hospital business, McKesson Provider Technologies, we are pleased that all of our clinical systems were certified as planned, and the most recent release of Horizon Clinicals is now generally available. These were very important milestones for us.  Overall, our Technology Solutions financial results did not meet our expectations as our Horizon product line profitability fell below our anticipated level. It's important to recognize that this financial performance is not an indication of problems or product functionality. The solution is working well in customer sites, and we are making steady progress every quarter. The profitability of our Horizon Clinicals product sales will continue to be negatively impacted by our top priority, which is getting our customers installed and eligible for the government's utilization incentives delivered to providers, when the so-called Meaningful Use criteria have been satisfied.  Our near-term priority is our customer's success. It's important to us to have a comprehensive set of solutions, not only for hospitals but for payers, pharmacies, physicians and patients. Today in the industry, these stakeholders have faced a broad set of challenges including new payment models, a number of regulatory changes, increased cost pressures and a higher bar for quality of care.  Recently, we saw the introduction of a proposed rule provisions for accountable care organizations, and we have a cross company group viewing the proposal and providing comments. Whatever form these organizations eventually take, ACOs, patient-centered medical homes or something else, there is no doubt that there is a need for a more coordinated approach to care. Importantly, this more coordinated approach to care will require the ability to integrate providers across multiple settings to support a new, more complex payment system with a technology infrastructure like ours that is contemporary and open.  With McKesson's broad set of assets, we are well-positioned to offer innovative solutions for all of our customers. This means that collaboration between our Provider Technology business, RelayHealth and Health Solutions will become more important as we go forward. Our RelayHealth Connectivity business differentiates our offering as we automate the operations within and across care settings and support the flow of financial and clinical transactions between health systems, physicians, pharmacies, payers and others regardless of their choice and underlying IT infrastructure products.  McKesson Health Solutions combined expert technology and evidence-based clinical information that enables payers to manage financial, administrative and clinical processes and improve quality. These 2 businesses are very important to our technology value proposition, and their momentum is building. Next fiscal year, we expect Technology Solutions revenue growth should increase modestly from the level of growth experienced in 2011. We expect continued leverage in our business, which should result in an expansion of our operating margin. Our key priorities in Technology Solutions are to continue the product implementations for our hospital customers to enable them to demonstrate Meaningful Use and receive the government incentives.  For our payer customers who are facing unprecedented levels of change, we will continue to partner with them to deliver innovative solutions to help them manage their medical and administrative costs. And in our Connectivity business, as care delivery shifts from traditional to alternate settings, we have challenged our teams to accelerate the pace at which we offer innovative new technologies to improve clinical integration and care coordination.  We are confident that as Meaningful Use and health reform drive new requirements, the assets across McKesson position us far better than the competition to help customers address the clinical, financial and administrative complexities of accountable care and other evolving care models. Before I end, I would like to spend a moment talking about capital deployment.  Over time, we've used our portfolio approach for acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and internal investment, creating significant value for shareholders. This year, we achieved near-record levels of capital deployment with share repurchases of $2.1 billion plus the $2.16 billion acquisition of US Oncology, our largest acquisition in a decade. In addition, in fiscal 2011, we increased our dividend by 50%.  We plan to continue our portfolio approach as we head into fiscal 2012. Our Board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $1 billion of common stock, bringing the total authorization to approximately $1.5 billion and approved a new policy, increasing our quarterly dividend from $0.18 to $0.20 per share. These actions demonstrate our confidence in the business and the stability of our future cash flow.  To wrap up my comments, our fiscal 2011 results provide us with a good foundation for continued success in fiscal 2012. Furthermore, if you look at our results over the past 4 years, you will see that revenues have increased at a compound annual growth rate of just less than 5%, which we leveraged into 8% growth in gross profit and further leverage into almost 14% growth in earnings per share.  We expect that many of the trends that have driven our past success will continue next fiscal year. Therefore, we expect fiscal 2012 earnings per diluted share of $5.55 to $5.75, excluding an estimated $0.06 of US Oncology acquisition-related expenses.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for a detailed review of our financial results. Jeff?
Jeff Campbell: Well, thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. McKesson capped off another year of solid financial performance, and we're pleased that we exceeded our original EPS guidance for the year and have laid a good foundation heading into fiscal 2012. In my remarks today, I'll cover both the fourth quarter and full year results. As you know, we provide our guidance on an annual basis due to both the seasonality and the quarter-to-quarter volatility that's inherent in some of our businesses. In this context, an annual look at our financial results can provide more meaningful insights into some of the key trends. So I will focus more on the annual numbers than the quarterly ones today, and I will also comment on what these trends mean to 2012.  Let me point out that my discussion today will focus on our full year FY '11 earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding adjustments of litigation reserves of $4.86, which you will see at the bottom of Schedule I in our earnings release. It is important to note, however, that this $4.86 includes $0.14 of US Oncology acquisition-related expenses.  Let me begin with our consolidated results. For the full year, consolidated revenues increased 3% to $112.1 billion from $108.7 billion a year ago. We had strong revenue growth in the quarter of 8% to $28.9 billion, primarily driven by organic growth in both segments, as well as our acquisition of US Oncology. Gross profit was up 5% for the year and 11% for the quarter, this is a tremendous result, given the higher-than-average gross profits generated by last year's incremental flu end. Total operating expenses for the full year were up 7% to $3.9 million, and up 12% to $1.1 billion for the quarter. Our full year and fourth quarter operating expenses were higher, primarily due to the US Oncology acquisition, and we recorded $43 million of US Oncology acquisition-related expenses on this line for the full year. If you think about this for fiscal 2012, the full year incremental impact of the ongoing US Oncology costs will drive about a 5% increase in the operating expense line for the overall company. About 1 point of this increase will be due to the expected $0.06 of US Oncology acquisition-related expenses that will also flow through this line in 2012.  Moving down the P&L. Other income was down a bit to $36 million for the year. I would note for modeling purposes that both fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011 benefited from one-time positive items that were each roughly $15 million to $20 million in size. Full year interest expense increased 19% to $222 million, which includes approximately $25 million of US Oncology acquisition-related expenses for the bridge financing we put in place. Excluding this $25 million, full year interest expense increased 5% versus the prior year, primarily due to the assumed US Oncology debt and the subsequent refinancing of the debt. This higher debt load will impact our fiscal 2012 interest expense. And for modeling purposes, we expect approximately $260 million of interest expense in fiscal 2012.  Turning now to taxes. Last quarter, we raised our full year estimate of the tax run rate to 34%. In the fourth quarter, however, we recognize some favorable tax discrete items, which drove our full year effective tax rate down to 31%. Going forward, our full year fiscal 2012 outlook assumes a tax rate of 33%. All of these factors we've now discussed gave us a full year earnings per share from continuing operations excluding adjustments to the litigation reserves of $4.86, which as I mentioned includes $0.14 of US Oncology acquisition-related expenses.  To wrap up our consolidated results, weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased 4% for the full year to $263 million and declined 5% for the quarter to $260 million. This year-over-year decline was primarily due to the cumulative impact of our share repurchases including $500 million in the fourth quarter, which brought our total share repurchases for the fiscal year to $2.1 billion. For fiscal 2012, we are assuming weighted average diluted shares outstanding goes down to 253 million.  Let's now turn to the segment results. Distribution Solutions overall revenues increased 3% for the full year and 8% for the quarter. To go to the components, direct revenues were up 7% for the full year and 12% for the quarter. When you exclude the impact of the US Oncology acquisition, which contributed about 5 points of growth in the quarter, our fourth quarter revenues increased approximately 7%. Warehouse revenues declined 13% for the full year and 1% for the quarter. Consistent with what we said over the past year, there were several factors that contributed to these result. Lower purchases from existing large retail chain customers, the effective shift of revenues to Direct Store Delivery completed in the first 3 quarters and the impact of brand to generic conversions.  Remember though that the impact on our earnings of lower warehouse revenues is much more modest as we earned lower margin on our warehouse revenues relative to the margin on our direct revenues. Canadian revenues on a constant-currency basis grew 1% for the full year and declined 3% for the quarter. Market growth throughout the year was partially offset by government-imposed price reductions on generics, which phased-in through the year and the generic to Lipitor in Canada.  Medical-Surgical revenues were up 2% for the year and up 5% for the quarter. Market growth this fiscal year was offset by the decrease in demand associated with the flu season. Excluding the incremental flu impact in the prior year, Medical-Surgical full year revenues grew approximately 6% compared to last year.  Gross profit in Distribution Solutions increased 8% for the full year and 10% for the quarter. For both the year and the quarter, gross profit is growing faster than revenues driven by strong branded manufacturer compensation and strong growth in our generics profits. Overall, this is a remarkable performance considering last year's incremental flu benefit primarily flowed through the gross profit line. As a reminder, we had $0.35 to $0.40 of incremental flu profits in FY '10, all of which flowed through Distribution Solutions at much higher than average gross profit margins.  Distribution Solutions operating expenses increased 9% for the full year and 15% for the quarter, primarily due to the acquisition of US Oncology. I would note that the $0.04 of US Oncology acquisition-related expenses in the March quarter primarily flowed through this operating expense line. For the full year, operating profit grew 6% to $2.1 billion. Our operating margin was up 6 points to 194 basis points, which is a tremendous performance given that the prior year's margin, excluding the incremental flu benefit was 172 basis points.  Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were up 2% for the full year to $3.2 billion and also up 7% for the quarter to $876 million. Recall that the sale of our McKesson Asia-Pacific business in July of this fiscal year cost us roughly 2 points in revenue growth for both the full year and the quarter. Throughout the year, as another example of our commitment to our customer's success, we continued to step up our investments in R&D. Technology Solutions and total gross R&D spending for the year are $436 million, up 5% compared to $414 million in the prior year. Of these amounts, we capitalized 12% compared to 16% a year ago.  Excluding the asset impairment charge, full year operating profit declined 3% to $373 million, and our operating margin rate was 11.67%. As John said, this is below our expectations and was primarily driven by the continued investment in the Horizon product line.  Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. For receivables, our day sales outstanding was flat to 25 days. Our day sales inventory decreased by 3 days versus the prior year to 31 days, and our day sales and payables of 47 days was down one day from a year ago. These working capital metrics, along with our continued focus on cash generation, resulted in cash flow from operations of $2.3 billion. This is well above our original guidance range and is a great result.  And when you look at our cash flow statement, you see that this is the second consecutive year in which we grew our revenues, we grew our earnings, yet we were also able to reduce our investment in working capital. Going forward, we have assumed this healthy level of cash generation will continue. As you can see that we expect our cash flow from operations to be approximately $2 billion for fiscal 2012. Capitalized spending was $388 million for the year, slightly below our original guidance of $400 million to $450 million. Moving forward to fiscal 2012 and with the addition of US Oncology, our guidance range for capital spending is between $450 million and $500 million.  Let me now provide some additional context for our fiscal 2012 earnings guidance of $5.55 to $5.75 per diluted share, which excludes $0.06 of US Oncology acquisition-related expenses. John already talked about our key business objectives, and in our press release today, you will find a list of key assumptions underlying this guidance. So I won't go over these again here. But I'd like to start by offering a few thoughts on segment margins. In Distribution Solutions, we expect operating margin improvement in the mid-single-digit basis points off our fiscal 2011 operating margin of 194 basis points. When you do the math on this assumption, you will see we expect to be around the top end of our Distribution Solutions long-term operating margin goal of 150 basis points to 200 basis points. This is an outstanding accomplishment, and it speaks to the true strength and sustainability of our business model.  Let me remind you that back in our fiscal year 2005, when we first provided this long-term margin goal, we had just ended that year at 141 basis points. We viewed then our long-term margin goal as aspirational, and the teams have worked hard to make steady progress. Sitting here today, we are in a position again, where we feel it is appropriate to set a new long-term margin goal. Therefore, our long-term operating margin goal in Distribution Solutions is now 200 to 250 basis points.  In Technology Solutions, we expect modest improvement in FY '12 over our fiscal 2011 operating margin of 11.67%, which excludes the asset impairment charge. While we continue to make progress towards our long-term margin goal of low to mid-teens in this segment, we do not expect to reach the lower end of this range in fiscal 2012.  Let me now turn to our decisions starting with our first quarter results of fiscal 2012 to report a new basis we call adjusted earnings. We have had many discussions with our shareholders and analysts in recent months about how we could make our reporting simpler and clearer. We have also had many discussions around the cash economics of our acquisitions and how to best communicate them.  After considering all these discussions, we have decided to move forward with reporting our financial results on the basis of adjusted earnings. Simply defined, adjusted earnings for FY '12 is our GAAP earnings from continuing operations excluding 3 things: acquisition-related expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and any AWP litigation reserve adjustments.  We believe this non-GAAP measure of adjusted earnings represents our core operating performance, and will provide useful information when using our past financial performance to help estimate the future financial results. It should also simplify and provide more clarity to comparisons of our results to other companies and to our expectations. Last, it will match how we run the company internally. We will, of course, continue to provide all of the GAAP information we have historically provided.  In thinking about our fiscal 2012 guidance and beyond, I think it is important to note that regardless of what EPS measure is used, our ability to consistently grow our earnings over the long term remains unchanged. One final and very important comment on adjusted earnings. With respect to consensus, we would ask that your models use this new adjusted earnings for fiscal 2012 estimates since this is how we will be reporting starting next quarter. We will provide historical financial information reflecting the adjusted earnings later this week, shortly following the filing of our 10-K.  Let me take a minute now to walk you through our adjusted fiscal 2012 guidance range, and let me emphasize that all of John's and my comments to this point today have been made using our historical reporting practices. So I now want to walk you from these historically based numbers to our new adjusted earnings basis. As you see in our press release today, we expect amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of approximately $0.44 per diluted share in fiscal '12. You will also see in our press release that we estimate that US Oncology acquisition-related expenses will be $0.06 per diluted share in fiscal '12.  Starting with our traditionally stated fiscal 2012 guidance range of $5.55 to $5.75, which is already adjusted for the $0.06 of acquisition-related expenses, you then add back the $0.44 for the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. This gets you to our adjusted fiscal 2012 guidance range of $5.99 to $6.19. So what does this new adjusted earnings mean for the segment guidance we have discussed up until this point today? In Distribution Solutions, our expectation for operating margin in fiscal '12 on an adjusted basis goes up a few basis points to high single digits basis points improvement, which we believe better reflects the operating performance of that business.  This margin growth expectation is off an adjusted fiscal 2011 segment operating margin of 204 basis points. Given these numbers, our new long-term operating goal of 202 to 250 basis points still very much applies.  In Technology Solutions, the impact of adjusting for the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets added 194 basis points to the operating margin in fiscal 2011 taking it to 13.61%. As a result, we are revising our long-term operating margin goal in this segment from low- to mid-teens basis points to an adjusted goal of mid-teens. And for fiscal 2012, on this basis, we would expect to be within the low end of this range.  Last, in terms of quarterly EPS, and you should know we do not provide quarterly EPS guidance due to the variability and the timing of certain items in our businesses. However, at this moment, we can directionally estimate that the June quarter of fiscal 2012 will be up modestly compared to the prior year once you adjust last year's first quarter to take out the benefit of the $51 million positive antitrust settlement. And again this year, earnings will be weighted towards the back half, and the fourth quarter will be exceptionally strong. In summary, McKesson delivered another year of solid financial results, and we feel we are well-positioned heading into fiscal 2012.  Thanks, and with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co: I guess, just a couple of quick questions. In this quarter, in the fourth quarter, can you call out any incremental expenses above and beyond what you called out for US Oncology around selling, general, distribution and administration? As I look at it versus our expectations, it just seemed like a higher number. So if there's anything you could call out there. And then secondly, John, can you just talk about how US Oncology is going, I think, you made earlier comments that you were down visiting with them. Maybe update us on where you are on retention, as well as garnering new doctors into your program.
Jeff Campbell: Sure, Lisa. If I've got your question right, the $0.04 that we called out of acquisition-related expenses, which is integration and relocations and severance and things like that all flowed through the operating expense line of Distribution Solutions. And I think it's fair to say that's really the only one-time in nature kind of cost that we incurred in the March quarter. You, of course, have the full run rate of the normal operating expenses of US Oncology that do appear in that line.
Lisa Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Was there anything else? So, Jeff, fuel costs or anything else that would impact those costs in the quarter?
Jeff Campbell: No, not really on the operating expense side, Lisa.
Lisa Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay.
John Hammergren: Yes, and Lisa, when we looked at the numbers, clearly at first blush before you realize that US Oncology is in that run rate, it looks like it's expanded quite a bit. But when we normalized it for the one-timers and the inclusion of US Oncology, it was right in line with what we normally would expect the run rate to be in Distribution Solutions. So there was nothing unusual or alarming by what we did there unless for some reason, we missed something. But it looked pretty normal to us when we did that reconciliation. As to US Oncology and the integration, we are very pleased with the progress we've made there. It's generally in line with the plan that we had made as an assumption in the acquisition case, if not a little bit ahead in some cases. And our management team has pulled together as I've mentioned, we reorganized and set the leadership in place from a go-forward perspective. We've met with the main constituents on the customer side and reorganized our sales force as well. So, I think, that we feel really good about the progress we've made. As to retention, I don't know of any customer losses as a result of this merger or frankly, at all. Although I'm sure there is some in the normal course. And as you know, the US Oncology physicians in particular have very, very long-term relationships with us. And if anything, the McKesson customer base is looking forward to understanding more about the services and capabilities that we can now make available to them as component parts to the US Oncology offering as well. So as you know, we plan to continue to be just a world-class distributor for those customers, who want to continue to use us in the fashion of pre-US Oncology. But we also want to allow our customers the opportunity to explore additional services that we would not have had available to them as simply McKesson. So we're pleased with where we are.
Lisa Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co: John, as a follow up there. You said you were ahead of plan, is that timing or margin expansion or something else? Can you just expand on that a little bit?
John Hammergren: I think it's not really financially related. It's more organizational related and sort of momentum related. I think the teams are getting after the plans even more rapidly than we would have expected. I'm not trying to make a financial statement here. It's really a qualitative rather than quantitative statement about our progress.
Operator: That will come from Tom Gallucci from Lazard Capital Markets.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: Jeff, I just wanted to make sure I heard something right first. The adjustment, the way you're reporting numbers now for fiscal '11 on the drug segment or was it Distribution segment, that increases the margin by 10 basis points roughly last year? So you get the 2.04%, is that it?
Jeff Campbell: Yes, exactly. And roughly speaking, probably 6 or so of those basis points in FY '11 are from amortization and 4 are because you've got the $0.14 of acquisition-related expenses from US Oncology mostly flowing through Distribution Solutions.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: So the amortization alone is somewhere around 6 basis points?
Jeff Campbell: Right. And then of course, that would grow significantly next year probably to 8 or 9 basis points, where the acquisition-related expenses go way down.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: Right. Okay. And then obviously, you're talking about a higher goal in terms of operating margin expansion in that business. Obviously, a lot of generics in the next year or 2. As you think about sort of the longer term, can you maybe just discuss the sustainability of related profitability on generics, as well as any other sort of key drivers as you think about expanding that goal?
John Hammergren: I guess, Tom, this is John. I think we believe strongly that this is going to be another very good generic year for us, and we're very optimistic about what fiscal '12's results will be from a generic perspective. The pipeline is expanding. Our sell-through to our customers continues to improve. The customers, we've been bringing value to it, and our ability to continue to source and do a good job of purchasing on behalf of our customers are all helping to fuel this. And then obviously, the schedule of launches is very attractive. And I would imagine the next couple of calendar years are going to experience that same kind of phenomenon. For our fiscal '12 though, I would say, the company is not carried entirely by generics. The rest of our business is going to perform well, and we expect that we will continue to be able to enjoy margin expansion, not attempting to put long-term guidance on us here. But we would not have come forward with a 200 to 250 basis point target range for our Distribution Solutions segment if we didn't believe that margin expansion over a long haul wasn't part of our plan. So is it possible that we'll have a year that's better than another year? Yes, maybe, but I think as we see it now, we expect to continue to grow, and I wouldn't expect at least certainly on here that we're going to have any real abnormal things other than continued strength in our business.
Operator: And we'll now go to Larry Marsh with Barclays Capital.
Lawrence Marsh - Barclays Capital: My question really is just on the follow-up on the generic question, which is maybe more specifically on OneStop. If you think about sort of one of your expert advantages as your ability to source, globally, as you talked about, how are you thinking about OneStop specifically in helping to drive that margin expansion? And how fast is it going to continue to grow for you as you think about increasing your penetration? And then just to follow on, I think the move to adjusted earnings makes a lot of sense. I just want to be clear. Is your message, it seems like your message for the fourth quarter was a little disappointing on Technology Solutions. You're saying first priority get customers to Meaningful Use. So in your messaging, it sounds like you're adjusting your expectations down a little bit from what you would have thought 6 months ago in Technology Solutions. Am I hearing that correctly or is there something else there that's going on?
John Hammergren: Well, let me start with Technology Solutions. I think that our view is that we're quite pleased with the progress of the organization, and you know we've made many changes in our leadership team there. And frankly, if you go into the organization, we've made great progress in our development organizations and our implementation team. So I think we're doing, frankly, a great job of getting after the issues that we would have faced 2 or 3 years ago that are now rapidly behind us. I think from a go-forward perspective, the clinical products are going to be a little less profitable than we had expected primarily because of the work required to make sure that our customers got them installed, got them installed quickly and are getting to Meaningful Use. And the compression of the buy cycle and the compression of the implementation installation cycle required by Meaningful Use, requires that we apply resources perhaps in a way that's less efficient than we would have otherwise experienced had we been able to do this in a more kind of normal course of business way. So that compression was felt in the fourth quarter. We had to use good judgment in applying resources to meet the requirements that we felt were appropriate with our customers, and to make sure they are successful and that's why, frankly, we underperformed a little bit there from a margin perspective. So I don't think you're going to see a big "recovery" or bowl of this going into the next quarter. I think you're going to see the general trends continue and what we talked about was revenue growth kind of in line with the markets and margin expansion in that business, which is sort of the typical speech we give on that business, and we would expect that to happen next fiscal year as opposed to some big bowl of success. As it relates to OneStop, yes, it is a very successful program for us. It continues to grow nicely and we're continuing to gain opportunities and penetration. And clearly, global sourcing is an important point in that. One of the things I think that we are beginning to experience is that our customers are not only signing up for OneStop, but in some cases, they may be willing to, especially some of the larger customers, source a product or 2 from us as opposed to the entire portfolio. That's also provided us an opportunity to fuel our growth, where they might have otherwise gone into the market, they'll come to McKesson because of our sourcing power. And as you mentioned, I think, penetration continues to improve as well. So we're optimistic in where we stand with generics. I think the Technology business, the most difficult days are behind us. But it's not going to be sort of gravy going forward, it's going to be a lot of hard work, and we'll get after it.
Operator: Our next question will come from Glen Santangelo from Credit Suisse.
Glen Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG: Jeff, I just want to ask you a quick question on margins. I just want to make sure I heard you correctly. So you sort of suggested for this fiscal year that you basically expanded your op [operating] margin in Distribution Solutions by 22 basis points to 194 basis points. Did I hear that correctly?
Jeff Campbell: Right. And just to be very clear, Glen, if you go back last year, what we talked about year ago on this call is that if you pull out the extraordinary H1N1-related profits we experienced in FY '10, our margin in Distribution Solutions last year was 172. So you would compare that to the 194 this year and just to say it, if the 194 does include a big chunk of those acquisition-related cost from USON, if you would have stripped those out, you actually be up at 198.
Glen Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG: Right. So just to follow-up on that, so it kind of sounds like you're forecasting pretty conservatively here, only about mid-single digit basis margin improvement. And as I think about the generic launch calendar falling very heavily in your fiscal third and fourth quarter you sort of, and I know you don't want to get in the business of quarterly guidance here, but should we assume less margin expansion in the first 2 followed by much more margin expansion in Q3 and Q4?
Jeff Campbell: Right. I think it's probably fair to directionally look at it that way, Glen. In particular, when you look at the generic calendar as we see it and we're going to be more back-end loaded and if you just take a product like Lipitor and my public comments about our expected launch date, we're going to get a little less than 2 quarters' worth of value out of that. And so when you think about our industry, the players in the industry with different fiscal years are going to experience perhaps different dynamics related to these generic launches. But I think that we believe we can get margin expansion again next year. We had a terrific year this year and as these things play out, we should have momentum as we move into fiscal '13 as a result of the calendar of these launches.
Glen Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG: John, can I just ask one follow-up question on HCIT. So it says in your press release that your margins were impacted by continued investment in the Horizon product line. So if I heard your comments correctly, it's not that you're investing in the technology of the product, is that you're investing in your customers basically with additional consulting services that are not billable. Am I hearing that correctly?
Jeff Campbell: Yes, I think that's generally correct. R&D investment is up slightly, and we are expensing the R&D associated with our revenue cycle product, AGRM, [ph] when we had that write-off, we're continuing to invest in that product, so that when customers come back around the buy cycle, we'll be ready for them. But I'd say that the thing that was probably a little bit more of the surprise in the quarter versus what we normally would see in development expenses, et cetera, was the manpower investment that we did make and are going to continue to make, to make sure that our customers are successful in this implementation. In our view, it's really critical that McKesson customers get to this Meaningful Use as fast or faster than their peers and that we build this solid base of customers, so we have a go-forward platform that continue to add value to them and to our business over time.
Operator: And we'll now go to Helene Wolk from Sanford Bernstein.
Helene Wolk - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: Just to start with on the fiscal '12 guidance for generic pricing trends, can you tell us a little bit about what you saw in the quarter and what you expect in terms of sustainability going into fiscal '12?
John Hammergren: Well, Helene, I think that we -- this is obviously a comment on McKesson's view of generics and our portfolio of mix of business and how we look at the market. I'm not sure that I'm not intentionally not making an industry comment. But as it relates to pricing trends, we see that they will be similar to what we've experienced in the prior year from a trend perspective and that we should see nominal deflation as opposed to what it had historically perhaps happened. So we have a pretty positive view on that component of what drives the business for us from a generic perspective.
Helene Wolk - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: And does that include any comment on supply availability or supply disruption going forward?
John Hammergren: Well, it's difficult to obviously break this apart and answer the question, what are the drivers to the stability or to our view of pricing. Clearly, availability plays a role in where people set their prices, as well as what the market's willing to pay for the product that is available. So I think that a combination of forces including market or manufacturer strategy and behavior have an impact on our view of pricing.
Helene Wolk - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then just last question on the technology side around the investment in the Horizon Clinicals, is that something that you think of or seeing from an industry perspective, this is what all vendors need to invest in, in order to meet Meaningful Use or is this McKesson specific?
John Hammergren: I'm not really inside their businesses, so it's very difficult for me to comment on what investments they're making and how they're making the investments and the timing of those investments. But I just think from our perspective it's a priority for us to make sure that our customers have got these tools up and running, and we're making those investments. So it's just impossible, Helene, for me to comment on other's peoples P&L's especially at the levels that we would see them.
Helene Wolk - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: Okay, I appreciate that.
Operator: And that will come from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs.
Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Jeff, just to go back to the quarter, quick housekeeping. So the tax is clearly a big swing factor, I'm getting $0.20 plus in the quarter. Can you just go back and give a little bit more detail on what exactly that was?
Jeff Campbell: Well, one of the things you hear me say pretty much every quarter is there's always some quarter-to-quarter volatility in the tax rate, Robert. I'd point out that we went into the year, 12 months ago, with a tax rate assumption for you of 32% for the year, and we ended up at 31%, which is pretty close. But in between, we had some ups and downs. In this quarter, I guess I'd point 2 things really. One you've got ongoing discussions we are always having with tax authorities around the world and when you reach certain points in those discussions, you make adjustments to your tax reserves, and we had some positive adjustments on that front this year. The other thing is you do things in the business that cause you to reflect correctly that your estimate of future tax liabilities changed. So for example, we made some decisions about where we put distribution centers in the U.S. that actually will have a pretty meaningfully positive future benefit for us in terms of all of our state tax liabilities. So those are really the 2 things that drove the March quarter change. But, I guess, I'd finish where I started, which is for the full year at 31% versus our 32% plan, we were pretty close to what we thought at the beginning of the year.
Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. That makes sense. So on the full year number, excluding the $0.14 from USON, that's $5 number that compares to the most recent guidance of 42 to 5 02?
Jeff Campbell: Yes.
Alexander Draper - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, and just the last question I had just on the new long-term operating margin expansion guidance for the Distribution Solutions. Can you talk a little bit more specifically about how Specialty plays into that? I know obviously the old band did not have the contribution from USON. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about how USON plays into that expansion goal?
John Hammergren: Well, I think it's probably fair to say that the more value and service we can provide to a customer, the higher likelihood there is that we'll have a margin to reflect that effort, energy and investment. So I think the US Oncology business is accretive to our overall margin structure. So just the additive nature of bringing them into McKesson's financial statements has a positive lift on our business. I think furthermore, the comment we made around adjusted EPS, if you don't have to put the amortization of the intangibles associated with this in there, which we think artificially depresses sort of a cash view of this, that the business actually is nicely accretive to our company and to our margin structure. So I think that, overall, we think it's a good place to invest, and we'll get a return on that investment that's above our cost of capital.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Robert Willoughby from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Robert Willoughby: Jeff, quickly just to step up in CapEx, is that all US Oncology related or is there's some other project going on? And then the second one maybe for John, we've never been an advocate of splitting the business, the 2 businesses. But a critic might say that the provider technology shortfall isn't much different than giving up margin to get a retained business. If you can get forward multiples that are out there for some of these competitors, when do you have to go back and revisit your strategy, particularly if that profit trend isn't going to be there for you as you expected?
John Hammergren: I'll let Jeff talk about CapEx, while I think about my answer.
Jeff Campbell: Mine is easy, John. So CapEx, you're correct. There is the addition of US Oncology. There's also a little bit of a step up in our spending around distribution centers tied a little bit to some of the tax comments I made a minute ago.
John Hammergren: On the multiple question. Clearly, our focus is really on making sure that our customers are going to be successful and that our team isn't distracted in the process of fixing the business on several dimensions. So our challenges there have primarily been in the McKesson provider technology portion of McKesson Technology Solutions. So it's in the subset of the business, and I believe that our focus has been appropriate on making sure that the business is running the way we need to have it running before we sort of revisit the question of, "Where does this business reside?" Like always, I think it's our responsibility to look at our portfolio of companies, whether we're buying or selling we've shown evidence of our willingness to address those issues on an ongoing basis, and I think we'll have to continue to. But right now, our job is to focus on the business to make sure we're delivering for our customers.
Operator: And we'll now go to A.J. Rice with Susquehanna.
Albert Rice - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Two questions about Technology Solutions, I guess, [indiscernible]. One is, obviously, you laid out the long-term goal for profitability there. What are some of the hurdles between where you're at now, what you need to achieve sort of gating factors to get to that higher end of your target range there? What do you have to accomplish? And then can you just remind us, how do you see meaningful -- I know that's one factor in Technology Solutions, but how do you see the layout of Meaningful Use impacting the business over the next year or 2? I mean, when do you think you sort of get to the peak benefit of that and when does the benefit of that from your perspective sort of start to taper off?
John Hammergren: Well, I think what's good about our business is that it's a portfolio of businesses. As we've talked about repeatedly on these calls, the RelayHealth business is a Connectivity business that largely is a transaction business that has pretty steady and visible levels of income. Our payer business has grown in a steady way, and our technology business in provider facing technologies, where this issue is most acute has been focused really on buying clinical products for the sole purpose of accomplishing Meaningful Use. And as that focus went in that direction, frankly, some of the purchasing that would have taken place in other of our products that might have even carried higher margins has diminished. And so I think we have the benefit of having the portfolio, which means that we have steady growth in our business hopefully over time. The downside on that is we're not a clinical hospital-only company, where the benefit of stimulus is going to catapult us to some level of record achievement and then we're going to face this issue of falling off that cliff going forward. So I think we should expect this business to just perform steadily over time.
Operator: And we'll now go to our next question from Eric Coldwell from Robert W. Baird.
Eric Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Mostly covered here. I just wanted to do one final clarification. You certainly would have, I assume, some tail of amortization from prior acquisitions before US Oncology. Are we to assume that you're also going to pull out all prior amortization from previous acquisitions? Or are we simply starting with US Oncology? And then as a follow on, if you do additional tuck ins through the course of the year, would you additionally call that out or do they have to meet some kind of hurdle for materiality?
Jeff Campbell: Two good questions, Eric. So our intention is to be completely consistent. So we will pull out all amortization related to any acquisitions including some as you point out that are quite old, where it's actually running off. And just for perspective, the total amortization in FY '11 was $0.31 as compared to the $0.44 that we see in FY '12. Similarly, even when we do small acquisitions, we will track all of the amortization or their acquisition-related expenses, and to the extent it's material enough to even round to one on our financial statements, we will always show that to you.
Operator: And we'll now go to Steve Halper from Stifel, Nicolaus.
Steven Halper - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Could you do a sort of walk through the delta between the 2011 operating cash flow, what you reported and the guidance for 2012? What were some of the positives in 2011 that might not repeat in 2012?
Jeff Campbell: So, Steve, just to level side everyone. So this year in FY '11, we had $2.3 billion in operating cash flow and our guidance is roughly $2 billion for next year. As some of you have heard us talk about and Steven, you and I have had this conversation, it's remarkable in our U.S. Pharmaceutical Distribution business in that the day of the week the year ends on, can mean a swing several hundred million dollars year-to-year just because of the pattern of when we bill customers versus when they pay. And so that really -- that's change in working capital in '12 versus '11 accounts for pretty much the entire difference between what happened this year and what you see next year. It's also why in many ways, when you look at our cash flow performance, I always encourage people, and in fact, I usually try to show in investor discussions the cash flow on a multiple-year basis because any 12-month period can really get skewed by that last day of the year.
Operator: That question today will come from George Hill from Citigroup.
George Hill: Maybe, Jeff and John, can you talk about as we think about your fiscal third quarter and your fiscal fourth quarter generic Lipitor will come on, you talked about it coming on from 2 sources. Do you mean that by 2 generic sources or Pfizer and one other manufacturer?
John Hammergren: Two generic sources.
George Hill: And then, I guess, can you talk about, how do you expect the pricing for that product to look as you think about it? And the third and fourth quarter will be -- do you expect to be typical rapid falloff in the acquisition in the A to B pay or do you expect it to be more -- to retain, to stay at a higher level given the 2 manufacturers.
John Hammergren: I think it's impossible probably for us to forecast what will happen with pricing. A lot of it will depend on how those 2 manufacturers decide to go to market, so I'm reluctant to guess.
George Hill: Okay. I only asked because I figured that's probably got -- I mean, that's probably $1 billion or so on how you model the year, depending upon which way that goes.
John Hammergren: Well, I think that -- Lipitor is important to us, but I think, as we said in the past even with Lipitor, we have a portfolio of generic opportunities. And I don't think our business is as sensitive to the pricing of Lipitor, the month it launches as much as it is to in aggregate that our team understands what we're buying in aggregate, what it's likely to sell for and that we get our customers on our program. So I don't think that our earnings guidance range is that sensitive to some of the nuances associated with the Lipitor launch. It's clearly important to us. I'm not trying to downplay it. It will help make FY '12 even stronger than FY '11 from a generics perspective, but it's not the sole driver of that success.  Operator, I want to thank you for time today. I want to also thank all of you on the call for your time. We have terrific customers, a great team and a solid plan. And I'm confident that our current solution portfolio, coupled with our balanced capital deployment will deliver solid annual earnings growth in fiscal 2012 and beyond. This is a great business in a terrific industry. So thank you again for your time. Ana?
Ana Schrank: Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events. We will participate in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Health Care Conference in Las Vegas on May 10, the Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference in New York on June 1 and the Goldman Sachs Healthcare Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes on June 7. We will release first quarter earnings results in late July. We look forward to seeing you at one of these upcoming events. Thanks, and goodbye.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect, and have a good day.

Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Corporation Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to introduce Ms. Ana Schrank, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Ana Schrank: Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2011 Third Quarter Earnings Call. With me today are John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and Jeff Campbell, our CFO. John will first provide a business update, and we'll then introduce Jeff who will review the financial results for the quarter. After Jeff's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 6:00 Eastern Time.  Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements.  Thanks, and here is John Hammergren.
John Hammergren: Thanks, Ana, and thanks, everyone for joining us on our call. I'm pleased with the company's third quarter and year-to-date operating results. This quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $28.2 billion and fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.12 excluding the $180 million pretax AWP litigation charge. Although we've not reached any final settlement of the remaining public entity AWP claims, we are making progress toward resolving these matters. Jeff will provide more details on the litigation charge in a moment, and all of my comments today will focus on our operating results excluding this charge. Our third quarter earnings included $0.10 of transaction expenses related to our acquisition of US Oncology, which closed on December 30. Let me highlight the third quarter trends in both segments, starting with Distribution Solutions. We had very strong results in this segment considering the exceptional increase in demand related to the H1N1 flu virus that we experienced last year. Our third quarter operating margin of 174 basis points is the result of outstanding performance in U.S. Pharmaceutical, Canada, Specialty Care Solutions and Medical Surgical.  Generics continue to play a significant role across our Distribution businesses. In the third quarter, sales of generics through our proprietary program OneStop grew 29% due to the study pace of launches and a high degree of compliance that our customers have with our value-added programs. We've also been pleased with the relative price stability within the generics market and the steady stream of launches where we have been able to negotiate great savings for our customers. In addition, our global sourcing approach to buying generics maximizes efficiencies and optimizes the value we deliver to our customers because we coordinate purchasing across the various businesses and geographies of McKesson. With a favorable generics launch schedule and our comprehensive offering, we anticipate continued profit growth in generics. Turning to U.S. Pharmaceutical. This business consistently performs at a very high level and contributes nicely to margin expansion. In addition to the strong contribution from generics, we continue to benefit from our long-standing relationships with branded manufacturers, delivering great value to them and earning steady levels of compensation in return. We have an outstanding value proposition that continues to register with our customers. We have a complete offering to help retailers and hospitals, whether large or small, operate their pharmacies. For example, retailers can benefit from our Health Mart offering with inventory management, branding and signage, business software and claims adjudication. We also offer Central Fill services, filling the patients' prescriptions in a lower cost setting right in our own distribution center. This offload some of the labor expense from the pharmacy. In addition, we have a robust offering that can help hospital pharmacies lower their medication-related expenditures and simplify their inventory reporting with our Fulfill-Rx solution. By taking a customer-centric approach to the needs of all pharmacies, we differentiate ourselves and earn long-standing relationships with our customers. As you know, we report the revenue of our Specialty Care Solutions business in U.S. Pharmaceutical. The big news for us in Specialty is our acquisition of US Oncology. We have been building our offering in Specialty and in particular for community oncologists for some time. We started out small over a decade ago and built the businesses internally before we added to our base business with the 2007 acquisition of Oncology Therapeutics Network. OTN gave us a significant scale in an industry-leading technology platform designed specifically for community oncology practices. With our recent acquisition, the combined organizations of McKesson Specialty and USON now offers oncologists and other specialty providers one of the industry's broadest arrays of technology, pharmaceutical distribution, reimbursement services, research and clinical services and back-office support, as well as the continued flexibility to select the business relationship model that best meets their needs. Oncologists in particular will have the option of choosing from a wide range of products and services beginning with our world-class specialty distribution. They can then add automated inventory management solutions as the need arises. The practice can also choose to be a comprehensive strategic alliance customer, which provides technology, practice management services and other resources designed to help community oncologists achieve long-term success. Community oncologists face business challenges such as declining reimbursement, movement toward bundled payments and accountable care organizations and the capital required to grow their practice. USON provides a full range of clinical and back-office services for doctors so they can concentrate on delivering the best clinical care to their patients while improving their financial performance. Not only do we provide a broad service offering to community oncologists, but we also expand our capabilities over time, and we can provide oncology-specific services and solutions to our hospital customers advancing the development of their cancer care programs. US Oncology supports 14 hospital partners in the expansion of their cancer care services. Our combined organizations will continue to explore strategies that extend value to hospital customers who wish to form partnerships with community-based oncology practices. With the combination of USON's physician-driven, evidence-based medicine program and McKesson's leadership in distribution and hospital automation technology, we have an unbeatable set of assets to help hospitals succeed. We believe that our specialty business and USON's are complimentary. Oncology is a high-growth part of the healthcare industry and the area with the most pharmaceutical innovation. USON will be additive to both our operating margin and earnings growth rate in our Distribution Solutions segment. We are extremely excited and optimistic about the future growth of this business. I will briefly touch on our other Distribution businesses. Medical Surgical revenues were down 2% in the third quarter, but this was due to the challenging comparison to last year's third quarter, which benefited significantly from the increased demand related to the H1N1 flu virus. We remain focused on delivering value to our Medical Surgical customers by optimizing our sourcing of the McKesson brand, and we continue to drive leverage through aggressive cost management. Combined, these conditions are resulting in margin expansion. Our Canadian Distribution business had a solid performance in the third quarter. Revenues have been impacted by price reductions on generic drugs driven by changes in public policy in certain provinces during the year and the launch of the generic version of Lipitor, which happened earlier this year. But, the team has done an outstanding job of offsetting these challenges. It is still our expectation that we will work through the public policy changes in Canada with only a modest financial impact that we can manage for this fiscal year. We are still evaluating the longer term impact of the changes and our response to them. In summary, the third quarter results in Distribution Solutions were outstanding, and I'm proud of the team's ability to continue to deliver value to our customers. We have a terrific combination of assets and have great confidence in our full year performance. Turning now to Technology Solutions. Over time, we've built a large and differentiated technology business with offerings for hospitals, payers, pharmacies and physicians. We have an intimate understanding of the market and a unique perspective on both the challenges and opportunities. Our technology segment is designed to meet the needs of our customer base using all of our assets, whether those assets reside in Provider Technologies, our RelayHealth business, our Payer business, our Ambulatory businesses or even within our Distribution business. As a result of stimulus, much of the industry focus and our internal focus in our Provider Technology and Ambulatory businesses has been on clinical solutions to position our hospital and physician customers to qualify for incentive payments under ARRA. This year, our teams have worked diligently to deliver the clinical solutions our customers need to enable them to demonstrate meaningful use, and we are pleased that our clinical systems are receiving certification. We are committed to partnering with our customers to ensure clinical solutions meet their needs. Customer installations of clinical solutions are progressing and given the implementation schedule we worked out with our customers, we still expect our fourth quarter to be our strongest. What's great about our business is our broad portfolio of technology offerings puts us in a unique position. The integration of clinical and financial information has become increasingly important to our customers who must demonstrate high-quality clinical care while managing the cost associated with that care.  We are a market leader in establishing connectivity in healthcare. We are the largest connectivity business in the industry with a significant footprint that allows us to move financial transactions across complex networks to help manage the information that is processed. Increasingly, customers are looking for us to connect them from a clinical perspective as well. We believe this is not only one of the fastest growing businesses inside McKesson, but will remain a very interesting and fast-growing business for us in the decade ahead. The team in our Technology Solutions segment is focused on developing and implementing the solutions that our customers need in this age of healthcare reform, and we remain confident in our future prospects.  Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I want to mention that even after closing the USON transaction, our balance sheet and cash flow strength continue to provide us with flexibility to deploy capital. You should feel confident that we intend to use our balance sheet and cash flow wisely and strategically. I believe we are well positioned for continued success. Based on the operational momentum in our Distribution Solutions segment, we are raising our fiscal 2011 guidance range, which is now for $4.82 to $5.02 per diluted share from continuing operations, excluding the adjustments to the litigation reserves and the full year US Oncology transaction expenses of approximately $0.15 per diluted share.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff and will return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?
Jeff Campbell: Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. McKesson posted solid operating results this quarter. Strong execution in our Distribution Solutions segment is driving our results. And with the acquisition of US Oncology, we successfully leveraged our balance sheet and healthy cash flow, positioning us to create shareholder value over the long term. Overall, we continue to expect a strong finish to the year. Let me start by walking you through a couple of items that impacted our financial statements this quarter, starting with the $189 million AWP litigation charge. This charge represents an increase to an existing litigation reserve for current and possible future public entity claims against McKesson relating to drug reimbursement benchmarks known as average wholesale prices, or AWPs. As a reminder, we initially established $143 million reserve for these public entity claims during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 when we settled the private payer AWP claims. Since then, we have continued to work through the remaining public entity claims.  The pace and progress of discussions involving state and federal Medicaid claims accelerated during and after the third quarter. As a result of these settlement discussions and our most recent review of these claims, the litigation reserve has been increased by a pretax charge of $189 million. This $189 million charge has been recorded in the Distribution Solutions segment. It equates to $0.52 per diluted share.  So when you look at the bottom of Schedule I in our earnings release, you will see our third quarter EPS from continuing operations, excluding adjustments to the litigation reserves, is $1.12. My discussion today will focus on this number. It is important to note, however, that this $1.12 EPS includes approximately $0.10 of transaction expenses related to the US Oncology acquisition. As one other point of clarification about the quarter, the balance sheet of US Oncology is included in McKesson's balance sheet as of December 31, 2010. Given the December 30 close date for the transaction, however, the operating results of US Oncology will not be included in our Distribution Solutions segment until the March quarter of the current fiscal year. Let me now talk about our consolidated results. Total revenues and gross profit were flat for the quarter compared to last year. Market growth across our businesses was offset by lower warehouse purchases by two of our U.S. pharma customers. We also are now lapping the incremental revenues and higher than average gross profits generated by last year's incremental flu demand related to the H1N1 flu virus. As a reminder, the overall impact of the demand related to the H1N1 flu virus was approximately $0.25 per diluted share in last year's third quarter. Total operating expenses for the quarter increased 2% to $965 million. This line includes $24 million in transaction expenses related to the US Oncology acquisition. Excluding these costs, our operating expenses were roughly flat year-over-year. We have been saying that we expected year-over-year operating expense growth to moderate in the back half of the year as it now has, and we expect this to continue in the March quarter. Other income was $7 million compared to $25 million in the prior year. The prior year benefited from the sale of our equity interest in McKesson Logistic Solutions in Canada, which resulted in a pretax gain of $17 million or approximately $0.05 per diluted share. Interest expense this quarter includes $10 million related to the bridge financing we put in place for the US Oncology acquisition. Excluding this $10 million, interest expense declined 9% year-over-year to $43 million, primarily due to the repayment of $215 million of long-term debt in March 2010.  Moving now to taxes, excluding the impact of the litigation charge and similar to last quarter, we experienced a change in our expected foreign domestic income mix for the year. As a result, our estimate for the full year tax run rate has been raised to 34%. Net income for the quarter was $288 million, and our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the AWP litigation charge, was $1.12, which as I mentioned, includes approximately $0.10 of transaction expenses related to the USON acquisition.  To wrap up our consolidated results, our diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 258 million for the quarter. We continue to expect our full year average share count to come in a bit below the original guidance we provided, 267 million shares outstanding. Let's now move on to a discussion of our two segments, in Distribution Solutions, revenue growth overall was flat compared to the same quarter last year. Total U.S. Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services revenues declined 1% versus the prior year. I will point out that this quarter was unfavorably impacted from having one fewer sales day this year. Direct revenues were up 2% for the quarter. When you exclude the impact of the incremental flu demand in the prior year, our direct distribution revenues grew by 3% to 4%. Our warehouse revenues experienced an 11% decline year-over-year primarily due to the lower purchases from two of our large retail chain customers. I would also remind you that brand-to-generic conversions particularly impact warehouse revenues. As we discussed during our last earnings call, however, the impact on our earnings of lower warehouse revenues is more modest as we earn lower margins on our warehouse revenues relative to the margins on our direct revenues. Canadian revenues on a constant currency basis grew 2% for the quarter. Including a favorable currency impact, revenues increased 6% versus the prior year, while market growth rates were above 2%. Government-imposed price reductions on generics, combined with the launch of generic Lipitor in Canada, continued to impact our Canadian revenue growth. Medical Surgical revenues declined 2% for the quarter to $744 million driven by the decrease in demand from the H1N1 flu virus. Excluding the incremental flu demand in the prior year, Medical Surgical revenues were 4% to 5% compared to last year. Gross profit for the segment declined 2% to $1.1 billion with gross margin down seven basis points. Here again, you see the impact of the prior year's incremental flu benefit as most of the $0.25 of H1N1-related profits last year flowed through the Distribution Solutions segment.  So in fact, it was a very healthy performance to be only down seven basis points against this comp. This was driven by strong growth in our generics profits along with the volume and timing of when we receive compensation under our agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. Overall, year-to-date price increases through December 31 have been in line with to a bit better than our original expectations. Our Distribution Solutions operating expenses increased 7% to $608 million, which includes the approximately $24 million of transaction expenses related to the acquisition of the US Oncology. Excluding these transaction costs, our operating expenses were up approximately 3% with the year-over-year growth moderating sequentially as we expected and as you saw in the company's total operating expenses. Operating margin for the quarter was 174 basis points and year-to-date, we are now at 185 basis points versus 176 basis points in the prior year. We are encouraged by our year-to-date operating margin and as a result, now expect our full year operating margin to be up versus last year's GAAP margin rate of 188 basis points. This is a remarkable performance given the earnings last year from H1N1 demand, which flowed through to the Distribution Solutions segment at a higher than average margin. In summary, we are extremely pleased with the strong year-to-date performance and margin expansion for our businesses within Distribution Solutions. In Technology Solutions, total revenues increased 2% to $790 million for the quarter. Service revenues were up 3% in the quarter, reflecting the more stable nature of these revenues. This quarter, we recognized approximately $23 million of previously deferred revenue related to a disease management contacts with CMS, which roughly offset the impact of the sale of our McKesson Asia Pacific business in the second quarter of this fiscal year. As a reminder, this Asia Pacific business generated approximately $18 million in revenue in last year's third quarter, and we will continue to see the McKesson Asia Pacific revenues impact our year-over-year comparisons through the first quarter of 2012. Software and software systems revenues of $135 million declined 2% from the prior year. Hardware revenues of $26 million in the quarter were up 13% from the prior year. Technology Solutions gross profit was up 8% versus the prior year to $379 million, driven primarily by the recognition of the $23 million in deferred revenues, which had related expenses that were recognized in previous years. Operating expense increased 1% in the quarter to $273 million. Our continued cost containment efforts across the segment have allowed us to maintain our investments in R&D, while keeping expense growth low. Our total gross R&D spending was $108 million compared to $103 million in the prior year. Of this amount, we capitalized 10% versus 13% a year ago.  Technology Solutions' operating profit increased 31% versus year ago to $106 million. Our operating margin in this segment was 13.42% for the quarter compared to 10.51% in the prior year. For the full year, our assumption of modest operating margin improvement, excluding the second quarter asset impairment, remains unchanged. Now if you do the math on this assumption, you will see it assumes an unusually strong March quarter. This remains our expectation based on the implementation schedules we have worked out with our customers along with various product certifications and GAs, which are scheduled to conclude in the fourth quarter. Leaving our segment performance and turning now to the balance sheet. Let me remind you that our financial statements include US Oncology's balance sheet but not their income statement for the quarter. As a result, it is more relevant to discuss today our working capital metrics excluding US Oncology.  Our receivables were $8.6 billion, a 4% increase over the prior year driven primarily by the addition of USON's receivables. Excluding these USON receivables, our days sales outstanding decreased to 23 days from 24 days last year. Compared to a year ago, inventories were up 8% to $9.5 billion, and payables were up 4% to $13.6 billion. So our days sales in inventory of 32 days was up two days from a year ago, while our days sales in payables increased one day from a year ago to 45 days. These working capital metrics have resulted in $1.3 billion of operating cash flow year-to-date. Given that we had another good quarter of cash generation, we are feeling more positive for the year, and we now expect it to be in the higher end of a range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion in cash flow from operations for the full year. This healthy cash flow generation led to a cash balance of $3.2 billion at December 31. And with the assumption of the outstanding US Oncology debt, which we plan to refinance, our balance sheet is now in the middle of our target range of having a gross debt-to-capital ratio of 30% to 40%. All of this positions us well for continued capital deployment.  Capitalized spending was $268 million for the first nine months in line with the $271 million we spent in the prior year. Our annual guidance for capital and software expenditures in the range of $400 million to $450 million remains unchanged.  Now, I'll turn to our outlook. As John mentioned earlier, we are raising our guidance on diluted EPS from continuing operations, excluding adjustments to litigation reserves, from $4.72 to $4.92 to a new range of $4.82 to $5.02. This new guidance range excludes transaction expenses related to the acquisition of US Oncology, which we expect will approximate $0.15 for the year including the $0.10 we incurred in the December quarter. You heard me last quarter talk about seeing a pathway to achieving our original guidance range. Since then, that path has become much clearer. Our Distribution Solutions segment delivered strong third quarter results beyond our forecast and overall for the year is performing at a very high level. This strength in Distribution Solutions has given us confidence in our ability to achieve our new higher guidance range despite the increased in our full year tax run rate assumption from 33% to 34%. Obviously, to achieve this guidance, we expect the fourth quarter to be unusually strong in both segments. One last point about our fiscal 2011 outlook, we continue to expect US Oncology to have a neutral impact to earnings this fiscal year excluding the approximate $0.15 of transaction expenses. In summary, we are pleased with our third quarter financial results and believe our year-to-date performance positions us well for a strong finish to fiscal 2011.  Thanks. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time In the interest of time, I would ask that you limit your questions to just one per person to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Larry Marsh, Barclays Capital.
Lawrence Marsh - Barclays Capital: I really wanted to get your comments, John, on the statement you made about seeing relative pricing stability in your generic marketplace. I know you've called that out in the past, but how do we put that in context? I mean, you guys have a great buying program under Saul Factor, but yet this has to do with individual prices. Is this somewhat of an anomaly, or do we think that this is signaling a more significant trend as you think about the big generic opportunity in '11 and '12?
John Hammergren: That's a good question, Larry. I think the comment really refers to the behavior of pharmaceutical manufacturers, not the wholesalers, just to be clear, is the inbound price we are experiencing from the manufacturers or that we're seeing as market level pricing. And one of the concerns that investors have expressed in the past is the deflationary effect that generics have not only in our pre-branded revenues, but once they become generic, there's always concern about it deflating further or coming out at such a low level there is not enough gross profit dollars in the sell price to properly fund the system, so to speak. And I guess my comment was really meant to say that we are seeing less deflation in generics, and in fact, are seeing more inflation on some of the generics that have been market for a while. And as long as McKesson is able to get a very good buy for our customers, that pricing stability actually bodes well for us because it provides for enough margin in the marketplace for us to be properly paid for the services we provide.
Lawrence Marsh - Barclays Capital: Just a clarification then on your buying opportunities. How quickly are you going to be able to leverage some of your buying into the specialty oncology marketplace now that US Oncology is completed? And would that fall under Saul Factor's team as well?
John Hammergren: Well, I think we're already beginning to see some opportunities from our coming together with US Oncology. Our teams have gotten off to a great start. Our organization has been locked in place, and in fact, it was basically announced the day that we closed. And we have got all of this under our Global Sourcing business, and Saul runs our Global Sourcing activities. So this is a combined operation. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we really look at generics on a company wide basis, and frankly, we look at brands also on a company wide basis. And as you might guess, we purchase a lot of branded product for the specialty market both on the hospital as well as the community side, but we also purchase a lot of generic products. So we try to take a holistic approach, and US Oncology is already a part of that holistic approach.
Operator: Let's move on to JPMorgan, Lisa Gill.
Lisa Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co: John, when we look at your healthcare IT business, you recognized $23 million of deferred revenue in the quarter. But, it looks like you still have north of $1.3 billion on the balance sheet. Can you maybe just talk to us around some of the metrics that you have to meet in order to be able to start recognizing that revenue and when you expect we'll start to see that?
John Hammergren: Well, yes. Jeff can jump in here, but just in terms of our revenue recognition, a lot of our revenue is dependent upon our ability to successfully implement our customers on our product lines. And we follow a very stringent and significant process called percentage of completion accounting. And for a lot of that revenue, we are focused on recognizing as we get our customers successful. There's also a significant portion of revenue, obviously, that comes in through maintenance on a regular basis, and we do have service revenues. So they're all important to us, but we do have bookings that we have in our backlog. I'm not really sure if they appear on the balance sheet per se, but I'll let Jeff talk about that.
Jeff Campbell: Yes, two things, Lisa. When you look at that $1.3 billion that's on the balance sheet, I think it's important to realize that the majority of that number actually just represents the timing difference between when customers give us the cash on annual maintenance contracts and when we recognize it over the course of the year. So there's a minority portion of that $1.3 billion that is really the kind of revenues hung up on the balance sheet that you're talking about where we have, in many cases, a product that is either fully installed or close to installed, but the rev rec [revenue recognition] is hung up for any one of a number of reasons: getting to the final end of the completed contract on all the products with the customer. In some cases, right now we have products that depend on certifications that we still expect to come in the next couple of months. And in some cases, we have revenue rec that's dependent upon when products become generally available. And in fact, that's why in my prepared remarks I pointed out that our strong fourth quarter does depend on a number of things in all of those three areas following on to our existing schedule.
Lisa Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And so when we think about margins, Jeff, kind of longer term, clearly, the margins were solid this quarter. You had $23 million that you recognized. Should we think about that you'll have a chunk that will be recognized where there is not necessarily cost to go with it in the fourth quarter? And how should we be thinking longer term around the IT business and how the margin structure looks?
Jeff Campbell: So for the full year, Lisa, we still expect some modest operating expansion over our full year margin for last year, which when you look at it, it means you probably see a margin for the full year a little below 13%, which will mean a very strong margin in the March quarter for the reasons you cited: a fair amount of revenue dropping to the bottom line without a lot of cost. When you think about the future, I think you should expect to see us make modest progress on expanding the margin in that segment on a full year basis. The one thing I think John and I caution people on is don't take the March quarter margin and annualize it because it would be unusually strong.
Lisa Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And then just one follow-up on the lower warehouse purchases. Is that because of the dynamic that you talked about in shifting product from branded to generic, or is that some of your customer relationships on the warehouse side have changed?
John Hammergren: I think its probably a combination of both, Lisa. And clearly, we have been working with our customers to provide the best possible service to them. And some customers choose them to not really be involved in the logistics any longer of their products, which means that our warehousing activity is more direct to store as opposed to our warehouse to their warehouse. So that elimination of that extra step saves them money and provides a better productivity. And then clearly, the other factor that Jeff mentioned is the movement of product to generic just has a negative effect on revenues. And sometimes they'll source those generics, especially the biggest customers, they'll source those generics directly into their warehouse as opposed to running it through a McKesson operation. So I think its really a threefold phenomenon. We're serving more customers directly to the store, generics depress revenues overall even though they help us with profitability and then this idea of the mix changing when they move direct on generics.
Operator: And we'll take our next question, let's go to Steven Valiquette with UBS.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank: As far as the transaction expenses, I just want to confirm, that was about $40 million pretax based on my math and was that all in the operating expenses line?
Jeff Campbell: Yes, to be very clear, and I probably should have been clearer. There's $24 million that appears in the operating expense line and that's professional fees and a settlement we had with [indiscernible] in closing the transaction. And there's $10 million that appears down in the interest expense line, and those are the fees associated with our bridge financing. Just due to the tax attributes of those items, that $34 million of pretax cost translates to $0.10 after tax.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank: And then just quickly, on the Canadian operation, any update on the IPC situation?
John Hammergren: Well, the IPC operation is actually a U.S.-based customer, and we have, obviously, a long-term, very solid relationship with IPC. And although we're disappointed with the place we are today relative to the litigation that we're discussing with them, we are continuing to service the business and we're hoping to get to a positive resolution. In Canada, our discussion has been primarily on two subjects, and that is the subject of the generic policy changes, which I covered in my earlier discussion. And we have a large customer up there called the Katz Group, and on occasion, we get asked a question about that relationship. And similar to IPC, we have a contract that's in place, and we're continuing to work with them to make sure that we continue to meet their needs and deserve the valued spot that we have in their business practices.
Operator: Let's go to Ross Muken with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG: Jeff, I just wanted one quick clarification in terms of the bridge loan, and then in turn what we're doing with the cash in terms of the existing US Oncology debt. So on a go-forward basis, should we assume that the bridge gets paid down and we're kind of back by the beginning of next year, kind of back at the sort of normalized run rate of interest, or what are the sort of moving parts on a go-forward basis?
Jeff Campbell: Yes, it's a good question. To simplify all the ins and outs, the way I would think about it is if you take the $10 million out of the December quarter, take that number and then add the interest on, let's say, roughly $1.7 billion or $1.8 billion of new debt that we will take out sometime this quarter in all likelihood at our kind of financing rates, and that will be the incremental interest expense I would annualize. The bridge other than the one-time cost should more or less wash up.
Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG: And in terms of now that we've obviously been fairly active both via M&A and earlier on a share repurchase perspective, and now that we're kind of through quite a period of activity where, obviously, given all that, we didn't do much on buyback in the quarter. What sort of the go-forward thought in terms of the share repurchase and kind of your intent to be active in the remainder of the year?
John Hammergren: Well, clearly, I think we have tremendous flexibility with our balance sheet. And as Jeff mentioned, we actually believe that our cash flow this year will be stronger than we originally anticipated when we started the year. And those are both very positive things for investors, and we plan to continue to use our balance sheet to grow our business and to properly deliver returns for our shareholders. And clearly, share repurchase is always a safe bet for us, and it's something that needs to be compared, in every case, to any acquisitions that are brought forward to us. The most important thing as we look forward is we continue to execute, and we have to execute with generics. We have to execute with the branded manufacturers. We have to get this US Oncology acquisition integration work continued on its right path. And clearly, we have opportunities to improve the performance of our technology business through the way we implement our products and develop our products. And so all of those work streams are underway, and we will not distract those with any, certainly, acquisitions that we might consider. On the other hand, we're not out of the acquisition business. We we'll look at it as they arise.
Operator: And at Sanford Bernstein, let's go to Helene Wolk.
Helene Wolk - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: To start with a question on the HIT business, I'm just curious how you think about sort of what's going on in D.C. around perhaps revisiting some of the investment piece? And then I guess questioning whether that's making any inroads or impact on new investment decisions by providers?
John Hammergren: It's an interesting question, Helene, and clearly, we just had this across-the-wire discussion from a Florida judge that talked about healthcare reform in its entirety. Frankly, we haven't heard a lot of discussion around the retraction of the stimulus money related to ARRA. So I think we have to separate in our minds the ARRA stimulus money versus healthcare reform. The ARRA stimulus money has significant benefit to our providers to complete their implementations and get to meaningful use and get that reimbursement. It also has a stick associated with that carrot, and that's if they don't get there, their reimbursements will go down. In talking with members on both sides of the aisle, I think everyone believes healthcare technology is an important part of our go-forward plan regardless of what shape reform actually takes. So I have my own personal doubts about them coming back to the issue of paying for the ARRA stimulus money. To the extent that, that does become a discussion or a debate, I don't think it will have any effect or much of an effect, I should say, on spending in this area as most of it is already in-flight and a lot of this work is underway. And frankly, most of our customers believe clinical investments were very important for both the issue of patient care and quality, but also the issue of cost. So I think they believed before and believe today that it's in their own best interest to implement this technology. What the stimulus did was provide inertia and a deadline around getting going with it. And many of our customers have plans that might extend five or 10 years to get to where they need to get to in the next couple of years. So those plans have been accelerated, and I can't imagine that they've put themselves back on a 10-year plan across the board. So there might be some risk, Helene, that they would do that, but I don't think that that's something we see right in front of us.
Helene Wolk - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: And then just a second question on US Oncology. I know there were these questions we received on the third quarter performance. Can you give us any sense in terms of what the fourth quarter performance was, whether it met your expectations or some semblance of understanding?
Jeff Campbell: Well, Helene, a couple of comments. As you recall when we announced this, we made the point that this would be additive to both our growth rates and margin rates. Over time, we expected it to be neutral to our results in the March quarter and then accretive beginning with our fiscal '12. Their December quarter results, which, as you point out, aren't available publicly, are consistent with all the assumptions we made going into the transaction and consistent with all of the guidance we've given you for the future.
Operator: And Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Robert Willoughby: You saw the CDC update, their forecast for diabetes patients. Do you guys pay attention to that data? Or is it anticipated in your numbers, or is it just consistent with the trend?
John Hammergren: Well, I think that diabetes clearly is a very important issue for our country as it relates to our business that clearly are pharmaceutical and medical issues related to diabetes, and probably the closest thing to us is in disease management where our programs have proven the ability to reduce the impact and the severity of diabetes and help prevent the disease or certainly control it once people have been diagnosed with it. So I clearly think there are some discussions and dialogues going on in DM. It can be helpful. Med Surg [Medical Surgical], we have test strips and all kinds of other things that we sell for diabetes. And clearly, drugs in the pharmaceutical side, but they're probably not that material to our business. Certainly, not yet. I think the places where we get the biggest pop from diabetes would be in disease management when we get those kinds of contracts.
Robert Willoughby: And the data itself, how do you view the CDC data quality wise? Is that consistent with your expectations, or do you discount that?
John Hammergren: Well, I have to admit that I'm probably not a good critic of their data, and we sort of take it at face value. I think that anecdotally, everything we see from many of the industry pundits and data sources could tell us that diabetes continues to be a high growth problem for our country. And I guess on the positive side of that, high-growth problems from a healthcare perspective are usually opportunities for us.
Operator: At Lazard Capital Markets, let's go to Tom Gallucci.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: I guess, we've sort of been hearing the same thing for the last couple of quarters. It's all been good news, but your strength on the generic side, strength on the volume, I guess, as you put this quarter and the timing of branded manufacture payments. What are the keys that have been better than what you expected beginning of the year in the distribution side of the business?
John Hammergren: I think overall we're very pleased with the results. And as usual, I think we do a pretty good job of planning the business. And there's always things that disappoint and things that surprise us on the positive side, and our job is to try to balance those risks as we sort of forecast the year. So I think the Distribution business has performed well, particularly from a cost management perspective and a generic perspective. And I'd say on those two frontiers in particular, I think I'm really pleased with the results. We had some early price increases. And as we see what happens here in the fourth quarter, the branded price increases probably were also beneficial to us. But overall, all of our businesses are executing. And for Specialty and Medical and Canada had overcome some of the challenges they've had are all quite significant in and amongst themselves, and if all of them to be doing it simultaneously is also helpful.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: And then I think you sort of rolled over your guidance in terms of the range. But $0.20 with, I guess, one quarter to go, can you just maybe highlight what the wildcards might be if you're thinking about coming at the end of the quarter at the higher end versus lower end?
Jeff Campbell: Well, I'd really point, Tom, just to the usual things that we don't always have full control over, exactly what happens in the 60 days or so on generic launches; exactly what happens on the next 60 days around branded price increases, which is more of a timing of our compensation than total over the year; and exactly how we do, I'd say, on the very complex and large number of implementation, certifications and GAs that we have scheduled in technology in the March quarter.
Operator: Let's go to Robert Jones at Goldman Sachs.
Robert Jones - UBS: Just a follow-up on US Oncology. Now that you've closed the deal, obviously understanding it's still early. I was wondering if you could give us the initial broad reaction from the USON oncologists? And then as a reminder, maybe could you just highlight what the key drivers of accretion are as we move into fiscal 2012 and beyond?
John Hammergren: US Oncology doctors have had a great experience with US Oncology before the acquisition of McKesson, and they've been adding to their number of doctors in a quite significant way. So I guess the first thing I'd say coming into this is it's nice to have a customer base that's very satisfied in their relationship with USON. And the management team there knows the business exceptionally well, and they do a great job of delivering value in a myriad of dimensions, many of which I outlined in my prepared remarks. So we have a happy customer coming in. And I think that they are pleased thus far with their knowledge of McKesson. We bring a great, obviously, a great deal of financial strength to the partnership with USON. We alSo as we mentioned, have clearly a significant sourcing operation and an understanding for IT and the implementation of IT, which they're all in the midst of trying to do in their practices. So on a myriad of dimensions, I think we have skills that can help them. They don't want to get lost in the size of our company. They don't want to have relationships change. And I think, first of all, they're not getting lost. And secondly, the relationships they had before are the same relationships they have today. So all in all, I've dealt with many of them, clearly the largest of them, and I think they're very optimistic about what this partnership and the coming together of our companies will mean to them. And on the drivers of synergies, yes, I think they come in a lot of different ways as well. But, I would tell you, because we, I think, bought this asset at the right price, we don't necessarily have to get tremendous synergies to make it a good investment for our investors. And the synergies are largely -- some cost synergies are made on the corporate side, but many of the synergies will come through the areas that we just discussed: the IT side, the purchasing side. And then clearly, we think the growth rate and the margin structure of this business are additive to our underlying Pharmaceutical distribution business. So on the dimensions that we care most about, growth rates and margin expansion, this business should help us.
Robert Jones - UBS: And then I guess just thinking about USON, obviously, being something that could help drive margin expansion further and then in light of the continued margin expansion we've seen within Distribution Solutions segment, is there any update on the long-term operating margin goal? I know there was some discussion around this last quarter.
John Hammergren: Well, we always hesitate to put the cart before the horse, and we have not accomplished the end of our range that we gave you probably eight or 10 years ago. So we're pleased to have made so much progress over that period of time, and we clearly understand that having a goal that you've already accomplished isn't much of a goal. So we will look hard at that as we think about next year's guidance. And when we discuss it with you in May, we'll probably be prepared to provide some type of an update.
Operator: And let's go to A.J. Rice with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Albert Rice - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: On the Med Surg business, up 4% or 5% on an apples-to-apples basis excluding the H1N1 contribution last quarter. That seems like a fairly decent showing in this weak patient volume market. Can you comment on what might be behind that strength?
John Hammergren: Well, thank you for the complement, and we think it is very solid performance as well on the Med Surg business and we're pleased with how the team is executing. We actually do believe in that business where it's highly fragmented with many competitors, we're able to take some share because we're able to deliver better value and a more complete offering for our customers. You might also recall the business sits in a bunch of different spots. We're not only very large in the physician office market, which has had some pressure from a visit perspective, and even that business is performing well, we also have a large position on long-term care and a very significant growing business in extended care and homecare. So that platform of businesses is the right place to be, and I think that we are continuing to find synergies between the businesses and grow the margin rate as well as the revenue rate at or above market levels.
Albert Rice - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: And then just briefly on thinking about the acquisition landscape, can you just comment on maybe deal activity behind the scenes or are there a lot of things that might be of interest that are floating around out there right now in this environment? And maybe update us on any thoughts about areas of interest as well as how quick you might be back to the acquisition market given that need to integrate on US Oncology?
John Hammergren: Well, the fortunate thing is the US Oncology resides in our Specialty business, and the management team there is very skilled and adept. And as I mentioned, there's not a great deal of integration to go on there. We're not closing thousands of facilities and firing thousands of people. We basically have a line of sight on what we're going to do, and we're after it. So I don't think that our acquisition appetite is being diminished as a result of USON, setting aside the comments made earlier about execution. Clearly, the deal activity ebbs and flows. We are in or view of most deals. Hopefully, we review them early, and hopefully, we view them often. And when we don't do them, it's because we've decided that we can't either make it fit financially or that it doesn't fit strategically. And So I think our job is to be on top of it. And I'd say the other positive comment on this is that we are in a lot of different businesses. So it gives us the ability to have a 360 degree view on acquisition opportunities. And so we will look at things that only IT companies would look at, and we look at things that only distribution companies would look at. And that puts us in a unique place, I think, to deploy our balance sheet.
Operator: A question now from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: So a couple of follow-up questions. First of all, on the Distribution Solutions segment, I think last quarter you talked about improved generic compliance rate with the institutional customer segment. So did this trend continue in the December quarter? And alSo as we think about CapEx modeling future periods, is US Oncology going to be part of kind of like the institutional customer segment when you think about your customer mix? And does this mean that we should model further improvement in compliance rate for that particular segment?
John Hammergren: Well, I'll let Jeff think a little bit about where it fits in our segmentation. We talked about it being in U.S. Pharmaceutical. The generic compliance opportunity for us, I think, continues in all of our businesses. Clearly, we're further ahead in some than we are in others relative to the customer sets. And what we've been talking about as an industry in the last year or so has been our ability to partner with group purchasing organizations to meet their hospital generic opportunities or requirements. And So McKesson has benefited from going back to our hospital customers with a generic portfolio that we previously would not have marketed, and we are not marketing today. And So I think we're in the early phases of realizing the opportunity in the hospital market from a generic perspective. In US Oncology, clearly, the practices they own will buy exclusively from McKesson, like they bought exclusively from US Oncology. The practices they manage, I should say, through the CSAs. So I think that our ability to help them purchase generics and to be "compliant" will obviously be very strong given their aligned interest with us. But Ricky, I think we're making progress really across the board. Some of our customers that have been with us a long time and have been fully compliant along time will benefit from new generics more so than from just increased compliance.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: And then one follow up on the operating margin. I think, Jeff, you said that the operating margin for the Distribution segment is going to be slightly above last year's level. So are you also excluding US Oncology, the hit that you've seen this quarter and what you're going to see in the fourth quarter from this calculation? Because when exclude it, we get to an even higher margin expansion for the full year.
Jeff Campbell: No, I'm really just comparing full GAAP to full GAAP. So last year, we were at 188 basis points for the full year in the Distribution Solutions segment, and what I said is we should be up. I don't think I said a little, I just said up versus that number.
John Hammergren: That's all-in then.
Jeff Campbell: Yes, it's all-in. It's a very strong performance.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: Okay, because when we include US Oncology, we get to another about nine basis points of expansion.
John Hammergren: You're saying if you eliminate the one-time charges associated with the purchase price or the one-time cost associated with the purchase price, is that what you're saying, Ricky?
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: Yes, exactly.
John Hammergren: Yes, and I think what Jeff is saying is those numbers are in his.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: Right, okay. So that's the source of the difference. Okay.
Operator: That will come from Steve Halper at Stifel, Nicolaus.
Steven Halper - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: If you look at the GAAP tax rate in the quarter, it was around 40%. If you take out the AWP litigation expense, it goes to around 27%. And then you indicated that going forward it would be 34%. So could you just reconcile those three numbers for me?
Jeff Campbell: Yes, Steve. This is a confusing point. Here's the way I would think about it. If you look at the Schedule I of the press tables, where we pull out the AWP charges and the related tax amount...
Steven Halper - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: The $189 million and the $56 million?
Jeff Campbell: Correct. So if you make that adjustment, you'll get to a rate for the quarter of about 36%, and that's the new 34% run rate. But because we booked the first two quarters at 33%, you have a catch-up adjustment, which for the quarter, takes that rate from 34% to 36%. But if you think about this from a modeling perspective, for the full four quarters, if you assume that we will have a 34% tax rate, if you apply it against the earnings excluding the litigation charges.
Steven Halper - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So when you say 34%, that's for the entire year? If you were to smooth that out?
Jeff Campbell: Exactly.
John Hammergren: And excluding the litigation charges. Well, I want to thank all of you for your time and energy and attention today. And I certainly want you to believe that we remain very excited about our unique offering across all of healthcare, and obviously, our ability to turn that into value for our customers and our shareholders. I'm now going to hand the call off to Ana to talk a little bit about our Wall Street activity for the next quarter or so.
Ana Schrank: Thanks, John. I have a preview of upcoming events. On February 8, we will present at the UBS Global Healthcare Services Conference in New York. On February 21, we will host a booth-side briefing at HIMSS in Orlando. On March 1, we will participate in the Oppenheimer Healthcare Information Technology One-on-One Conference in New York, and we plan to release fourth quarter earnings results some time in early May. We look forward to seeing you at one of these upcoming events. Thanks, and goodbye.
Operator: And that now concludes today's conference call. Thank you very much for your participation. Have a great day.

===== 2011 Q2  (2010-10-27 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Corporation Fiscal 2011 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ms. Ana Schrank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Ana Schrank: Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2011 Second Quarter Earnings Call. With me today are John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and Jeff Campbell, our CFO. John will first provide a business update, and we'll then introduce Jeff, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After Jeff's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meanings of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Thanks, and here is John Hammergren.
John Hammergren: Thanks, Ana, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call today. Let me start by saying that I'm pleased overall with our company's results for the second quarter and the first half of our fiscal 2011. This quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $27.5 billion and fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.3, excluding adjustments to the litigation reserves. Let me quickly highlight three items that impacted our financial statements this quarter. As we announced on October 19, we reached an agreement to settle an action filed by the state of Connecticut relating to First Databank's published drug reimbursement benchmarks, which are commonly referred to as Average Wholesale Prices. The settlement resulted in an after-tax charge of $0.06 per diluted share. This agreement includes an expressed denial of liability, and as we've consistently stated and continue to believe, this case is without merit because McKesson does not and never did set PWPs. We will continue to work our way through the remaining public entity matters, and our goal is to resolve them in a reasonable manner that is in the best interest of our shareholders. This quarter, we're pleased to complete the sale of our McKesson Asia Pacific business. And as a result, we recorded an after-tax gain of $0.28 per diluted share. The sale of this business is a great example of our ability to create shareholder value. And lastly, we recorded a noncash, pre-tax asset impairment charge of $72 million related to our revenue cycle management product, Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management. Both Jeff and I will discuss this in more detail on this call. Looking beyond the asset impairment charge, our results were strong for the company as a whole, particularly for Distribution Solutions and there's a lot to like about our second quarter results. Additionally, during the first six month of our fiscal year, we made significant progress deploying capital, including fully using the $1.5 billion available on our share repurchase authorization and increasing our dividend. Based on the operational momentum in our business and the results of our share repurchase activity, we are maintaining our fiscal 2011 guidance range of $4.72 to $4.92 per diluted share from continuing operations, excluding adjustments to the litigation reserve. Let me highlight the second quarter trends in both segments. In Distribution Solutions, we had a strong double-digit growth and operating profit, with margins expanding an impressive 25 basis points. U.S. Pharmaceutical, Canada, Medical-Surgical and Specialty Care Solutions all contributed to that outstanding performance. Our market leading generics offering filled much of the margin expansion in the second quarter. Over the years, we built solutions based on the differing needs of our customers, and we've been very successful at demonstrating the value of our generics offering to our customer base. In addition, we use a global sourcing approach to the procurement of generics, with coordinated purchasing across the various businesses and geographies at McKesson. This maximizes efficiencies and optimizes the value we deliver to our customers. With a favorable generics launch schedule and our comprehensive offering, we anticipate continued profit growth in generics for fiscal 2011 and beyond. Our U.S. Pharmaceutical Distribution business is performing at an exceptionally high level. We continue to benefit from our long-standing relationships with branded manufacturers, delivering great value to them and earning steady levels of compensation in return. Again, this quarter, U.S. Pharmaceutical's results benefited greatly from generics. Sales of generics through our proprietary program, OneStop, grew 21% due to the steady pace of launches and a high degree of compliance that our customers have with our value-added programs. Generics have also been very beneficial to our Specialty Care Solutions business, and we expect that trend to continue for the remainder of this fiscal year. We have been talking a lot about oxaliplatin for the past year, and we are still benefiting from this generic drug with sufficient inventory that last through the end of our fiscal year. In addition, we are now increasingly optimistic about two other specialty generic introductions, so we expect another outstanding contribution this year from our Specialty business. Our Medical-Surgical revenues grew 5% in the second quarter. We remain focused on delivering value to our Medical-Surgical customers by optimizing outsourcing of the McKesson brand, where we deliver high quality, private label products at great savings. In addition, we continue to drive leverage through aggressive cost management. Combined, these initiatives are resulting in margin expansion. Our Canadian Distribution business had solid performance in the second quarter. Revenues had been impacted by price reductions on generic drugs, driven by changes in public policy in certain provinces during the year, as well as the launch of the generic version of Lipitor, which happened in May of this year. The team has done an outstanding job to offset these challenges and deliver solid results this quarter. In our Canadian business, we have a comprehensive set of solutions and leading physicians in every market segment. It is still our expectation that will work through the public policy changes in Canada with only modest financial impact that we can manage within our guidance range for this fiscal year. We are still evaluating the longer term impact of the changes and our responses to them. I'm pleased with the second quarter results in Distribution Solutions. We have a terrific combination of assets and a seasoned leadership team that performs exceptionally well. I have great confidence in our full year performance. Turning now to Technology Solutions. Setting aside the asset impairment charge for Horizon ERM that I mentioned earlier, let me point out that as expected, our first half results are down quite significantly versus prior year. For the full year, we still expect modest operating margin improvement, heavily weighted to the back half. While this quarter's results are in line with our expectations, they are certainly not indicative of what we expect from this business long term. Now let me come back to Horizon ERM. This is McKesson's next-generation revenue cycle management solution that we designed to improve the economics of patient care for our hospital customers. Revenue cycle management products must keep pace with the changes in health care because the environment is only going to become more complex. Horizon ERM is one of the most functionally rich solutions available to hospitals. Given all of the changes that RO is driving and the rapidly changing needs and priorities of our customers, we are continuing our product development efforts on Horizon ERM. Over the past few quarters, we have been focused on improving our customer and quality focused by strategically prioritizing our investments and delivering integrated solutions that enable greater customer success. We've also ramped up our Six Sigma efforts to prioritize opportunities for process enhancements, including streamlining our product focus and improving speed of installations. We continue to make organizational changes that will further our efforts to provide integrated offerings and a greater focus on customer success. We are now combining our Horizon clinical and revenue cycle groups to form a new organization known as Health Systems Enterprise Solutions, which will be lead by Rod O'Reilly, reporting to Dave Souerwine. Rod has been running our very successful Medical Imaging Group for some time. He's got a great track record of innovation, execution and collaboration. And I know many of you on the call know Rod personally. The integration of the clinical and financial systems has become increasingly important for our customers who must demonstrate not only the clinical quality of care they provide, but also the costs associated with that care. We are always committed to supporting our customers, and in particular with their current priority, clinical implementations as they navigate the RO requirements and the changing healthcare environment. We are increasingly confident in our clinical products and the value they would bring to our customers. We have confirmed test dates for most of our EHR products starting to mid-November, and we expect to achieve certification shortly after testing is complete. We are pleased to report that one of the first products we submitted for testing, our RelayHealth platform, which is a Software as a Service offering, received the modular certification this week. Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I want to spend a moment on capital deployment. In addition to the $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program we completed in July, we subsequently repurchased $531 million in stock during our second fiscal quarter, fully using our authorization. Today, the board approved a new $1 billion authorization. Along with our increase in the dividend earlier this fiscal year, the share repurchase activity demonstrates our confidence in our business and in our future cash flow generation. We continue to target a portfolio approach to capital deployment, which would also include acquisitions. You should feel confident that we intend to continue deploying our capital wisely and strategically. In summary, we are seeing solid overall performance, and our strong balance sheet and tremendous cash provides us with many growth opportunities. I believe we are well positioned for continued success. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, and we will return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?
Jeff Campbell: Well, thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Our overall second quarter results reflect the solid performance at this halfway point fiscal year. We're showing operational results in Distribution Solutions above our initial expectations coming into the year. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we're pleased with our progress on capital deployment. Our Technology segment performance, while weak for the quarter, was in line with our expectations other than the asset impairment charge, which I'll explain in more detail in a few moments. We continue to expect a strong finish to the year and remain committed to enhancing shareholder value through a measured and thoughtful capital deployment approach. Before I begin reviewing our financial performance, let me start by pointing out that we completed the sale of our McKesson Asia Pacific business this quarter. The $0.28 after-tax gain on sale is recorded as a discontinued operation. And as you know, we focused on our results from continuing operations. Therefore, my discussion today will focus on our $1.3 EPS from continuing operations, which also excludes the impact of the $0.06 AWP litigation charge this quarter. It is important to note, however, that this $1.3 EPS that we'll focus on does include the asset impairment charge of approximately $0.18. With this background, as always, I'll begin with a review of our consolidated results and then provide additional color when I discuss each of the segments in more detail. Revenues for the quarter grew 1%  to $27.5 billion from $27.1 billion a year ago, and total gross profit increased 2% from the prior year. Outstanding gross profit growth in Distribution Solutions were somewhat offset by the asset impairment charge in Technology Solutions, which was recorded in the cost of sales. Excluding the asset impairment charge, overall gross profit would have increased 8% for the quarter versus last year. Moving below the gross profit line. Our total operating expenses are up 4% to $925 million for the quarter. For the full year, I would continue to expect our operating expense growth to be more modest than this 4% as our back half results will face easier year-over-year comparisons. Other income was relatively flat year-over-year, while interest expense declined 6% to $44 million for the quarter. Interest expense has been favorably impacted this fiscal year, primarily due to the repayment of $215 million in long-term debt in March of fiscal 2010. Moving now to taxes. We have raised our full year estimate of tax run rate from 32% to 33%, primarily driven by a change in our domestic foreign business mix. As a reminder, last year's second quarter's tax run rate was 32%, and we benefited from $13 million of favorable discrete items, equating to about $0.05 per diluted share. Net income for the quarter was $271 million, and our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the litigation charge, was $1.3, which, as a reminder, includes the approximate $0.18 asset impairment charge. To wrap up our consolidated results, this year's EPS number was aided by the cumulative impact of our share repurchases, which lowered our diluted weighted average shares outstanding by 3% year-over-year to 262 million shares for the quarter. Earlier, you heard John talk about our year-to-date fiscal 2011 share repurchases of over $1.5 billion. Taking this into account, we now expect that our full year average diluted share count will come in a bit below the original guidance assumption, 267 million shares outstanding. Let's now move on to our segment results. In Distribution Solutions, total revenues grew 2% in the quarter to $26.8 billion. Looking at the components, our U.S. Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services revenues increased 1% versus the prior year, with direct revenues up 6% and warehouse revenues down 15% for the quarter. The warehouse revenue decline, when adjusted for shifts of customer business to direct-store delivery, was something closer to 10% to 11%, which is still a significant decrease. Drivers of this decline were brand-to-generic conversions, which particularly impacts our warehouse revenues as well as some of our customers' business losses. However, when you look at direct distribution revenue, which is our most profitable revenue stream, we're pleased with the good growth we showed. After adjustments for shifts from warehouse to direct distribution, we grew direct revenues by 4% to 5%. Importantly, I'd remind you that we typically make lower margins on our warehouse revenues relative to the margins on our direct revenues. So to sum up, while our total revenue growth may look low, it was driven by trends that allowed us to, in fact, significantly grow our gross profits this quarter. We've been saying for a while now that it is important to focus more on gross profit rather than revenue, and this quarter's results really exemplify the strength. Moving on to Canada. On a constant currency basis, revenues declined 1% for the quarter. Including a favorable currency impact, Canadian revenues increased 4% versus the prior year. The combined effect of government-imposed price reductions on generic drugs and the launch of generic Lipitor in Canada resulted in about a 5% decrease to revenues. Medical-Surgical revenues were up 5% for the quarter to $770 million. In addition to a solid performance from our core business, we have also seen earlier sales of flu vaccine this year, which essentially offset the large amount of revenue from flu test kits that we shipped in the prior year. Gross profit for the segment was up 14% to $1.1 billion. On 2% revenue growth, this represents a nice improvement in gross margin of 43 basis points versus the prior year. The increase in gross profit for the quarter was primarily due to strong growth in our generics profit and the timing of the compensation we received from branded manufacturers. Distribution Solutions' operating expense increased 5% to $574 million for the full year, similar to our expectations for the overall company. I would expect our growth and expenses to be more modest. Operating margin rates for the quarter were 192 basis points, an impressive increase of 34 basis points versus the prior year. Given the quarterly volatility in this segment, we always focus on full year margins. In this context, based on our strong first half performance in this segment, we now expect our full year fiscal 2011 operating margin to be within the range of our prior-year GAAP operating margin of 188 basis points. Now we're very pleased with this forecast. As I remind you, the prior year benefited from the positive impact of our efforts around H1N1, making it a particularly difficult benchmark to match this year. Turning to Technology Solutions. Let me start by talking about the $72 million noncash, pre-tax asset impairment charge, which is approximately $0.18 after-tax based on our effective tax rate. Here at McKesson, we amortize our capitalized software over three years. As you recall, we began amortizing our Horizon ERM product late in the second quarter of our fiscal 2010, and it has been running approximately $8 million of expense per quarter. We do a calculation each quarter comparing the unamortized capitalized software costs to the projected net revenues during the remaining amortization period. Based on our most recent evaluation, the net revenues we foresee in the remaining 24-month amortization period were not sufficient to recover the unamortized costs, which resulted in the asset impairment charge. We remain committed to the product and would expect to expense most of our future development costs. Now turning to the rest of the segment results. Total revenues were down 3% from the prior year to $770 million. Part of this result was driven by the sale of our McKesson Asia Pacific business. While the profits from this business were financially insignificant, it did contribute approximately $17 million in revenues in last year's second quarter. We will continue to see the McKesson Asia Pacific revenues impact our year-over-year revenue results in the services line of our P&L through the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Also, as a reminder, the prior year was favorably impacted by the recognition of $22 million of previously deferred revenues. Majority of these deferred revenues were associated with ancillary products included as part of a bundled purchase, and were triggered when our Horizon ERM solution became generally available late in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. So adjusting for these two items, you'd see revenue growth of about 3% this quarter. Moving on from revenues. Excluding the asset impairment charge, Technology Solutions' gross profit declined 7% to $348 million for the quarter. Contributing to this year-over-year result is the prior-year deferred revenue recognition, which had equated to $16 million in gross profit. Operating expense increased just 1% in the quarter to  $263 million. We had total gross R&D spending of $107 million compared to $102 million in the prior year. This is a demonstration of our continued commitment to developing our products for our customers. Of this amount, we capitalized 16% compared to 20% a year ago. Our Technology Solutions' operating profit was down 26% versus a year ago to $86 million, excluding the asset impairment charge. To summarize, excluding the asset impairment charge, the overall Technology Solution results, while weak, were in line with our original expectations. We continue to expect a stronger back-half performance from Technology Solutions this fiscal year and modest improvement in the full year operating margin rate, excluding the asset impairment charge. Leaving our segment performance now and turning to the balance sheet and our working capital metrics. Our receivables were $8.2 billion, which is up from the prior year balance of $7.8 billion and our days sales outstanding increased by one day to 24 days. Inventories increased 2% to $8.8 billion, while our payables increased 1% to $12.8 billion. This resulted in our days sales and inventory remaining flat at 30 days, and our days sales and payables remaining flat from the prior year at 44 days. These relatively stable working capital metrics resulted in McKesson generating $798 million in operating cash flow year-to-date. Based on the start to the year, we now expect to generate a bit more than our original expectation of $1.5 billion in full year cash flow from operations in fiscal 2011. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.1 billion, down slightly from our first quarter balance of $3.3 billion. Our great financial flexibility provides us good opportunity to continue our portfolio capital deployment strategies. Capitalized spending was $182 million for the first six months of the fiscal year, and we continue to expect full year capitalized spending between $400 million and  $450 million. And the last, let me turn to our outlook. Our guidance range remains at earnings from continuing operations of $4.72 to $4.92 for fully diluted share excluding litigation charges. What this means is that we have absorbed in our range both the $72 million pre-tax asset impairment charge and the related increase in our full year tax rate assumption from 32% to 33%. These two items are significant hurdles, but we can see a pathway to achieving our original guidance range due to the outstanding performance thus far in Distribution Solutions, our expectation of a stronger back half in Technology Solutions and our lower full year share count assumption. One other point about the rest of the year, keeping in mind that we don't routinely provide quarterly EPS guidance. Sitting here today, we anticipate our fourth quarter to be unusually strong this fiscal year, both measured by its growth year-over-year and as a percentage of our overall earnings for the full year. Given the timing shifts in some of the economics we have with branded and generic manufacturers, we can directionally estimate that our December quarter EPS will be more in the range of our first and second quarters. In closing, we're pleased with the overall performance across McKesson, and we believe our financial flexibility positions us well for future capital deployment. Thanks, and with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I would ask that you limit your questions to just one per person to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And first we'll go to Glen Santangelo with Crédit Suisse.
Glen Santangelo: John, just a couple of quick questions. I mean, the margins in both your businesses were clearly higher than I think what most of us were expecting. For years, I kind of feel like you've been targeting an operating margin goal in Distribution Solutions of between 1.5% and 2%. Now you're continuously bumping into the upper bend of that. Can you maybe talk about what's driving that? Is there anything beyond generics? Is it more on the specialty side? Just listening to Jeff's comments, you're talking about a big March quarter already. I mean, are we now going to be looking at sustained operating margin north of 2%, and is that really just generics driving that?
John Hammergren: Obviously, we have continued to focus on margin improvement, particularly in our Distribution businesses and in particular, U.S. Pharmaceutical. When we guided to the 150 to 200 basis point range, we were probably down to mid-120s. And I think people believed that was a stretched objective and perhaps we were out of our minds to target that kind of improvement. We believe it was possible by looking at our historical performance and really, global performance of wholesalers and we believe that margin rate is still a great tribute to our success and our teams. I think it's a little premature for us to guide to future revenue goals or targets other than to say that our, I would say, we are continuing to focus on margin improvement as part of our business model, and that clearly a mix is assisting us there. We are selling more generics, as you mentioned. We are also selling a more private brand, and we continue to have great relationships with the branded benefactors. And so a combination of all of those things. Disciplined cost management and disciplined sell-side management as it relates to our relationships with our customers are all coming together to allow us to expand our margins. So we're really pleased with the results, and we're pleased that we're able to do that while we're still saving our customers' money.
Glen Santangelo: John, maybe if I could just ask one quick follow-up to that. I mean, are you having success going to some of your big chain customers in selling your generics offering into those guys? I mean, ultimately, as we look out over the next 12 to 24 months, given the patent cliff, are you nervous about some of that branded volume? Any leakage outside of the system as those guys go direct, or have you been successful selling generics into some of those big chain customers?
John Hammergren: Well, clearly, we continue to penetrate the marketplace with our generics programs because they're increasingly more and more competitive than people might be able to achieve on their own. Clearly, there's an infrastructure cost that our customers can deleverage. And as I mentioned, we have a great portfolio of products where we do a terrific job of buying them. I think it probably is a stretch to think about the very largest customers buying their generics from us because they're very sophisticated in their own buying. But on occasion, we do sell generics to them, particularly when their own supply is not available to them. And we do see some revenue impact when our large chain customers buying a brand from us. And when it goes generic, they buy the generic on their own. But frankly, our margin structure and a lot of those relationships, particularly on the warehousing side, is so low that even if we lose the revenues, it's not a significant impact to us. And clearly, it's more than offset by the generic pull-through in the rest of our customer base where we have significant opportunities to save them money, take the patient money and include better margin structures for ourselves simultaneously.
Operator: Next, let's go to Larry Marsh with Barclays Capital.
Lawrence Marsh: The way I'm looking at it is your Distribution Solutions business, given your margin guidance, is about $0.20 accretive to earnings relative to what I think we assumed earlier this year. Without going through specific nuances, I'm curious how much of that do you think is driven by incremental margin in your Specialty business? And in the context, just sort of customer relationships, are you in a position to comment about the IPC serve-all relationship and the value add you have there?
John Hammergren: Sure, why don't I talk about the IPC serve-all situation, and Jeff can talk a little bit about the margin and its accretion to our earnings. And the IPC serve-all relationship has been a long one for us. It's obviously unfortunate that they've elected to take this action as filing a lawsuit. But we believe, obviously, the case is without merit and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves. In the meantime, we continue to focus on servicing our IPC customers and doing the best job we can as we have over the past decade, delivering high-quality product, highest service levels in the industry and great customer relationships. So I think that we have to focus on the customer, and we have to see if we can come to some mutual, acceptable end to this. And that's our goal, but we'll have to see where it lands.
Jeff Campbell: And Larry, on the Distribution outperformance, we could calculate the number a different way. But I think you're in the ballpark with the tremendous strength that, that collection of businesses is showing relative to our initial expectations. And there's really a lot of drivers. I would agree with you that generics are the biggest driver, and it's important to think about the fact that that's generics in Canada, it's generics in our traditional U.S. Pharma business and it's generics in our Specialty business. And we're gaining in all three of those areas. We also, as John talked about, continue to we create growth in some of our private brand efforts, which is helping us in the Canadian environment. Some of the regulatory changes have been deferred a little bit from what we initially thought in our plans. And frankly, our team up there is doing a little bit better job than we might have anticipated it, managing their way through that. So it's really a function of all those things combined with the steady and strong economics we have in our relationships with the branded manufacturers that is so far driving us to a much stronger year than we have initially anticipated in those Distribution businesses.
Lawrence Marsh: And John, I know in Canada, just a quick follow up, you quantified kind of how we should think about potential impact this year. Given your record of performance, are you able to quantify how we should think of mitigating factors as we think about next year? And should we think about Canada as being a little bit more uncertain in its visibility for next year? Or is that way too soon to come to that conclusion, given customers and mix?
John Hammergren: Clearly, the regulatory changes around generic pricing has a negative effect on that business. And this year, as we've mentioned, we've been able to offset and mitigate most of that risk, partly because we've had a lot of actions and plans underway that have been very positive for us. And partly because, as Jeff has mentioned, some of this has been rolling out later in the year, which gives us less of the challenges. If you think about the full year impact in the next fiscal year, it's probably premature to say what we'll be able to mitigate and offset versus what will perhaps be a visible drag in the business. Our goal, clearly, is to offset as much of this as we can and to work with our partners in Canada to find ways to do that, and hopefully, come out to the other side in good shape. But clearly, it's a challenge as we think about fiscal '12.
Operator: From Lazard Capital Markets, let's go to Tom Gallucci.
Thomas Gallucci: I was wondering if you could comment on the OneStop growth driver. Is there any new customers in there that we could think about some other sort of adjustment number? Or is that sort of the real number? And how much of that thing is newer generics that are available versus maybe growing your penetration within your customer base?
John Hammergren: Well, clearly, I think it's driven by many factors, including more generics in the marketplace. But we are growing faster than the market. So it would show that we are taking a larger portion of our customers' generic spend. So our goal has been, and we'll use the words penetration and compliance, we are focused on really trying to make sure that our customers understand that we have the best basket of generic products available for them at the best possible price and it's to their advantage to buy the holistic portfolio of products and not to attempt to go around it and construct activities. It would not be beneficial to them and clearly, would be dilutive to our compliance and penetration of the total spend. So I think I share of their wallet is growing up, and I think that's showing in our OneStop generic performance. We've also talked about the fact that we're expanding the program into other sectors, including the hospital sector, which we've talked about on previous calls. So we have new customer bases. We're starting out with a very little market share of their existing generic spend, and we're pointed into our proprietary programs. So I think it's a combination of a good market in the right time with the right dynamics. A great program, well developed, it's capturing a fair share of the margin structure available for us. And then lastly, laying the pipes into our customers and then getting them to buy our solution set.
Thomas Gallucci: And then to follow up, Jeff, could you just clarify some of the issues that are sort of driving that unusually strong fourth quarter? You mentioned maybe the timing of some branded manufacturing payments. Anything else there that you're thinking about?
Jeff Campbell: It's really, in Distribution Solutions, just that, just the way the year has worked out on both generic and branded economics. And then of course, we've been talking all year about the unusually strong back half in Technology Solutions, particularly the March quarter, just the way that the implementation schedules, and frankly, some of the certification and other product development issues around our clinical product suite have played out.
Operator: And Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Robert Willoughby: Jeff, you mentioned flu vaccine contribution in the quarter. Could you throw out a number of range of contribution from that? And I guess, we dropped that down then in the third and fourth quarter that we won't see that number again. And then if you had some reasons for just the sequential uptick in profitability for that IT business. It's a good effort. Just wanted to know what you thought the main drivers there were.
Jeff Campbell: Well, one at a time. So if you start in our Medical-Surgical business, I'd remind you that, that, in the context of overall, McKesson is a small business. And our seasonal flu profits are modest by the standards of the company overall as you're talking a couple of pennies a year. When you look, however, at the year-over-year results this quarter, we have gotten off to a much earlier start with seasonal flu vaccine. And that's a good thing. I will tell, I won't really know until we get to the end of the next quarter, whether it's a good thing but not that great because demand didn't continue or whether in fact it continued and we sold the rest of our vaccines. That business is important to us because it's important to our customers that we provide that service. There's always a little bit of variability here in how it goes. Today, we have in Technology business, really the drivers, as we've talked about are that, in our Hospital business, you got customers almost exclusively focused on buying and implementing clinically oriented systems. We have made significant investments in our people to make sure we've got the right teams in place to both finish the necessary development on the products, to meet the final requirements as well as get implementations done quickly for our customers. There's just a lot of implementation schedules to be done in both the December and March quarters. You also got a couple of the key clinical products that have both a  certification that needs to be done as well as a general availability target time line that needs to be hit. And both of those things, for certain customers, are tied to when we recognize revenue as well. So it's really that focus that drives the strong back half.
Robert Willoughby: I was actually wondering about the quarter itself, Jeff. You were up a few hundred basis points sequentially, and I just thought that was a bit more than I would have thought you would have been able to do.
Jeff Campbell: Well, it's nice to get a pat on the back, and maybe we're so just focused on it. It's down year-over-year, and as John said, that's not the kind of result we expect to the business in the long term. But everything I just said applies to this quarter. So it was at its trough, if you will, in the first quarter of this year as we had invested a lot in additional people and a lot of resources and had very little getting through to the end of implementations, and got a little bit better this quarter. We'll get, I think, more significantly better next quarter and then a lot better in the March quarter.
Operator: Lisa Gill at JPMorgan.
Lisa Gill: Jeff, I was just wondering if you could talk about the timing aspect on the new $1 billion share repurchase? And what is currently built into the expectation for your '11 guidance?
Jeff Campbell: Well, we certainly, Lisa, never made comments about when we might buy shares back. We're opportunistic on that, and we think about it in the context of our overall portfolio approach to capital deployment. It's our commitment to our shareholders that we've talked about it, and we do intend to close for our target leverage and that could be through acquisitions, could be through using the new share repurchase. And we'll make those decisions as we go forward. If you think about the guidance, what I said is that while we started the year with an assumption that for the full year our weighted average shares outstanding would be 267 million, just based on what we've already done, we will clearly be a little bit below that. But we haven't necessarily built into our guidance additional share repurchase.
Lisa Gill: And then can you just remind us, John or Jeff, as to how you are looking in acquisitions and areas that you think you would potentially be interested in? And maybe John, just talk about the competitive landscape right now and where you think there might be opportunities from a acquisition standpoint.
John Hammergren: Sure, Lisa. I think the first thing we have to think about is whether the acquisitions make financial sense. And clearly, if you look at the effect of the use of the cash, the value of the target alternatives for use of that same cash, and it has to make financial sense. Perhaps not in the acquisition quarter because of one-time related issues, but certainly over time, it has to make sense. And we have to get a return for our investors that is superior to other alternatives that we might be evaluating, including the safer versions of share repurchases and dividends. It has to have a strategic sense for us. It has to be something that we know and understand and can build upon and we can grow and leverage. And hopefully, there are synergies that can be captured that our shareholders wouldn't be able to capture on their own if they purchase the asset on their own, particularly if it was a public company and they're holding it that way. So I think those are the big buckets. I don't feel like we're particularly constrained on our view of which segments we would buy into. And I don't think we're particularly constrained on geographic preferences. I don't think we're particular constrained on the size of the deal as long as you can kind of fit in those three broad sweeping categories. And we, frankly, are evaluating acquisitions all the time and have been for as long as I've been here. So you will hear from time-to-time that we're looking at something, and then you'll either hear that nobody bought it or it was never for sale or somebody else bought. But just because we're involved in evaluating transactions, it doesn't mean that we're always going to end up with the target in the end. So I think it's an ongoing process. I think we've got a skilled team with a proven track record of being able to pick the right targets, integrate them appropriately and get the value for our shareholders. And clearly, as was discussed earlier on this call, things like Oncology Therapeutics Network, OTN, which was a drag on us, I think, for almost two years, as I recall, we told you it was going to be dilutive upfront and it was going to be very beneficial for our shareholders over the longer haul. Frankly, it positioned us extremely well in a very high-growth sector in specialty and oncology, and we're really pleased we have that asset. So it may not be apparent always upfront. But the value of paying for the acquisition is equated in the near-term results. But clearly, if we have a plan that we can execute, then we'll go forward and we'll deliver against those expectations that we have in that acquisition as well as per se and the many distribution acquisitions within where we just rolled companies into our Distribution structure so...
Lisa Gill: So having said all that, I think that this management team has done a good job around making acquisitions and laying out the prospects, for example, around OTN. So what's holding you back right now, John? I mean, you have a great balance sheet. You've got lots of cash. Is it that the price of the assets in the marketplace or something that you think would fit in isn't currently available in the marketplace? I mean, how would you characterize it?
John Hammergren: Well, I think sometimes it's a combination of all of those things. It might be the assets we want are not available, or maybe the assets we want are not priced where we want them to be priced or we're busy doing something else that it's got our team focused on another activities. And so now you may not see results from those activities. It could be that we're rebuilding our technology management team right now. And we may not be actively pursuing technology acquisitions. Dave Souerwine is there focused on that recovery of that business. So from time-to-time, we're in and out of the markets, and I don't think you should draw any major conclusions out of it other than when we are able to successfully execute on one, you'll hear about it. And also, Lisa, I might just mention it. It's clear that when we don't have acquisitions in front of us, we're not afraid to do share repurchases, and we've done over $1.5 billion this year. And I think our shareholders should be comforted in the fact there we're not waiting around for decades to deploy capital, that we understand the value associated with doing it sooner rather than later.
Operator: Next, let's go to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Jones: I just wanted to touch on the Medical side and utilization. I was curious if you guys could delve a little deeper into what you're hearing and seeing out there just given the IT exposure to hospitals and the distribution exposure to the physician office. As far as it relates to the trends throughout this year, has it stayed the same, gotten worse, maybe gotten a little bit better?
John Hammergren: Well, I think that the trends we see in our Medical businesses, and to remind you, we're not really involved in the acute care medical supply business. And our systems business in acute care is really not affected by patient demand levels. So we see very little -- we don't track data related to admissions in hospitals or surgery procedures in hospitals because the sale of our product in the hospital marketplace, the system sale, is not really related to that. It's more driven by the need to upgrade their systems or they'd become our compliant, et cetera. On the nonhospital business where we are strong, physician offices, home care, long-term care and emergency centers, emerging care centers, those kinds of things, surgery centers, we have seen relatively flat demand. But I think our team has done a particularly good job of continuing to expand our footprint, not only within our existing customers like selling through our private label product, but also expanding beyond our existing customer base and probably taking a share, in particular, in home care, where we've got a very good presence. So I think we are continuing to see our ability to grow revenue in Medical-Surgical as evidenced by the 5% growth this quarter, and we hope those trends will continue. And our team is now really focused on continuing to execute. And a larger view of physician office visits, et cetera, clearly, I think that those really haven't changed much in the last 12 months. But that's sort of a 40,000 foot view.
Robert Jones: And I just have one follow-up on the Technology business. As we think about the improvement in the segment in the back half, I was wondering if you could just remind us how much of the pickup is related to you lapping the increased expenses, or investments, I should say, versus incremental sales recognition as we move to fiscal 3Q and 4Q?
Jeff Campbell: It's really almost all just seeing the revenue pick up. So our expense base, operating expense base, like we mentioned, was only up 1% this quarter, for example, and is fairly flat going forward. So it's really all about hitting the milestones around implementation, certification and GAs between now and March 31.
Operator: And with Morgan Stanley, let's go to Ricky Goldwasser.
Ricky Goldwasser: I have a few follow-up questions on guidance. First of all, Jeff, to make sure that I heard it right, the third quarter guidance you said between first quarter to second quarter level, so for first quarter should we use the $1.10 and then for the second, $1.03 (sic) [$1.3]?
Jeff Campbell: I think the answer is yes, and I'm just searching for a piece of paper, which I will confirm that answer to you in one second. So why don't you go ahead with your next question while looking that up.
Ricky Goldwasser: Sure. And then if it is $1.07 then, which is the midpoint, what are the swing factors to the third quarter? So what could grow better than what you're kind of factoring it now? And then secondly, I think you gave us all the pieces of the puzzle, except for the new share count that you are seeing in guidance. So I think the prior share guidance was 267 million? If you can provide us the new share count.
Jeff Campbell: Well, we didn't give a specific number, Ricky, because as you know, it's going to depend on exactly where our stock price is, exactly how many people exercise options. So there's always a little bit of uncertainty. So that's why we went with just telling you, look, it's going to be down a bit. And you can kind of do the math based on what happened this year. That's probably going to get you to a number likely somewhere between 261 million and 265 million.
Ricky Goldwasser: And then on Horizon, can you walk us through by how much you lowered your revenue expectation for Horizon?
Jeff Campbell: Well, I didn't break out a specific number, Ricky. What I would tell you is that the revenues from Horizon ERM in fiscal '11 were not material. If you look out over the next two years, the remainder of the amortization period, we certainly had an original plan to sell and implement sufficient customers to justify the asset that we had on the balance sheet. What's really happened is that our customers in there, complete focus on clinicals, have not just stopped buying things for now other than clinical, but they've also pushed out implementations and stop implementing. You combine that with the fact that as we look at the way the environment and requirements to what this product needs to do has evolve, we also, frankly, decided that given what was going on with our customers, it made sense for us to step back, and frankly, focus on finishing out the development of this product to meet all the new and latest requirements. That's going to take us a number of quarters. And as we do that, we're going to aim for those few customers that want to implement. We're going to push some of those implementations out. The combination of all those things is what pushed the revenues out beyond the remaining amortization period. I think it's important to realize though that these products, these kinds of products are products that should have usable life spans of 10, 20, 25 years. So there's this accounting convention where we need to look at the next three years. But our full expectation and hope here is that we're building the next equivalent of some of our legacy revenue cycle product, which we still have happy customers running 20, 30 years after they put them in. And quite frankly, it's a pretty good financial proposition for us at that point in time.
Ricky Goldwasser: And Jeff, if we think about it really as we think about Horizon conflict [ph] over that time period, for the next couple of years, I mean, are we being too conservative assuming that Horizon would have accounted for 10% as kind of like your provider expected [ph]?
John Hammergren: I think the way to think about Horizon ERM, the Enterprise Revenue Management product, and our view from a revenue perspective and the long-term plans is that, as Jeff mentioned, because of the push out from our customers' perspective nor it could support from an accounting perspective the balance sheet amortization that we have. As we think about the long-term growth of that segment for us, I don't think we'll directionally change our discussions. I think that it's a part of the portfolio approach of products that we bring to the marketplace. And as we talked about this year, that sector we thought was going to grow in the 4% to 6% kind of range from a market perspective, and that we thought we would grow in those kinds of ranges. We haven't given FY '12 guidance. But I don't think sitting here that we will have a significant change in our view on how we're going to grow relative to the market because of this specific product line in the massive MTS, which is a much larger organization than financial systems for hospitals.
Jeff Campbell: And Ricky, just to come back, to be clear for everyone, so our guidance of $4.72 to $4.92 is based on a first quarter EPS of $1.10 and this quarter EPS of $1.3 and all of that is continuing operations. We do exclude the litigation adjustments. And other than that, those are the numbers we go with.
Operator: And we'll take that from Eric Coldwell with Baird.
Eric Coldwell: But I'm just curious, Horizon Enterprise isn't the only revenue cycle pull that you have. So are you seeing strength in any revenue cycle or practice management-related products, number one? Number two, I just want to clarify that you're saying this is a situation of not seeing market demand versus the market choosing other solutions. And I want to verify that that's across all of your customer types, from small solo practices up to the large IDNs, that it's not just these largest IDNs filling in things. Just hoping for a little more color on those topics.
John Hammergren: Sure. I'll attempt to answer the question. I think that the discussion that we've been having around Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management is isolated to hospital financial systems, and it's not a commentary on the rest of our software or physician software, even Horizon Clinicals. It really is the hospital market place saying to us -- our customer base where we would naturally go to sell these enterprise revenue management products, our customers are saying to us, "We're happy running that 20-year-old to 30-year-old software we bought from you 20 or 30 years ago." And our priority is to is to get you clinical systems installed and to make sure we purchase the right systems and we get to our meaningful use and be able to document that from a regulatory and a compliance perspective to get the stimulus dollars that the industry is chasing. I don't believe that Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management that we are losing any hospital customers or potential customers to competing systems. Once again, I'm really talking about our existing customer base was the natural place to sell this product and those customers are largely looking to build out McKesson solutions as opposed to taking out McKesson solutions. That's not to say that we, on occasion, don't lose a  customer. And it's not to say that we haven't lost a clinical customer or a financial customer. I'm just talking about enterprise revenue management, and the revenue issues we have in that product really are not product-based as much as they are market-based. And then I believe competitive market since our customers' interest has gone to a different direction. As it relates to the overall portfolio and we think about financial systems that our customers are buying, frankly, they're not replacing their old legacy HIS systems. They are buying some what we call the bolt-on products on occasion to augment the systems that they already have deployed. And in fact, RelayHealth is selling many of those products. Some of them delivered Software as a Service where they can easily augment the functionality of existing McKesson STAR systems with Relay Software as a Service applications, where they're able to get a quick return on investment. And so when they see a quick return on investment and something they could put into the system very quickly and make use of if they're doing it, but they're not going to undertake, at least in this near-term environment, a complete redo of their financial systems in these hospitals when they're busy with clinical implementations. Does that answer your question, Eric?
Eric Coldwell: It does. And I guess at the end of the day, I'm not the kind of guy who's going to jump on these calls and try to get a derivative call for another company. But when somebody is visible and large as McKesson, making the comment that could be misinterpreted as no customers are buying revenue cycle tools right now, it has the potential to cause some damage across other companies, some of which people on this call might be invested in. So I just want to make sure that you're really talking about large enterprises with your existing customer base, and you're not making a blanket statement that no customers are buying revenue cycle tools today. And I think you've cleared that up.
John Hammergren: That's correct, Eric. I was not making a market commentary other than our existing customer market that are using 30-year-old STAR systems. And I know there's lots of competitors out there that we compete, with add-on, bolt-on products like our  Relay products. And customers are still buying those products. But they're just not interested in redoing their big financial systems in the midst of redoing their big clinical systems. Does that make sense, Eric?
Eric Coldwell: Yes, it does.
John Hammergren: Yes, and I'm sorry about the confusion. I wasn't intending to make a market comment.
Operator: Let's go to Steven Valiquette with UBS.
Steven Valiquette: Just trying to get a little more color on Distribution as well. So I guess, if you look at the sequential acceleration in Distribution profit growth in September quarter versus June quarter, again, the year-over-year growth, just trying to get a sense if the anniversary-ing of the lost retail and GPO contract and maybe even anniversary-ing the CDS care more [ph] contract renewal. Would that have played a large role or a small role in the sequential acceleration in the profit growth?
Jeff Campbell: Steven, I'm always very conscious about looking at sequential trends because the reality is the timing of our economics with generic and branded manufacturers vary every year. And we have a pretty darn good sense of how those economics are going to play out over a 12-month period. But we don't have a very good sense of which quarter, and it varies every quarter. So part of our really strong year-over-year performance in the September quarter in Distribution Solutions was just a difference in timing that I mentioned in terms of our branded compensation. So you shouldn't, in anyway, relate sequential trend into that. In fact, some of the strong September quarter, that's why I made more moderating comments about the December quarter and what that will look like.
Steven Valiquette: And I know you also don't like to talk about individual products, but just curious if the generic Wilbenaux [ph] played a meaningful role in the quarter. Was that product not really material or just singled out? Just curious for your quick thoughts on that.
John Hammergren: No, it wasn't really material. It went up  to single out, and it was built into basically our thoughts for the entire year. It has a little bit different profile than most generics because it has a substantial utilization in institutional customers. But I don't think it was a big deal for us.
Steven Valiquette: If I heard this right, I think you said so the EBIT margin now for Distribution should be somewhere in the ballpark of the 188 bps from a year ago. And kind of a small routing number, not that critical, but does that include or exclude the AWP litigation charge from this reported quarter?
Jeff Campbell: It exclude it.
Operator: That will come from Charles Rhyee with Oppenheimer.
Charles Rhyee: Jeff, maybe just going back to the expected margin ramp in IT as we move in the back half of the year. I know you addressed this a little bit. As we think about that waiting, is it really more in the March quarter or is it really maybe more spread evenly? And I don't know if you happen to gave this number in the past. How much of deferred revenues are we talking about maybe perhaps in dollar terms? And then as we think about that next year, we would assume a big pickup in the margins but then sort of normalized next year?
Jeff Campbell: Well, a couple of comments. The March quarter in every year is always by far our biggest quarter just due to it being the end of the sales year. And what you will see this year, that will be compounded by the implementation schedule and the certification and GA schedule. All that said, you should still see sequentially and year-over-year a much stronger December quarter than what you've seen from us the last two quarters. But March will be unusually strong. On the deferred revenue, we don't call out a number. There is a number on our balance sheet, which is not a particularly helpful number because frankly, it's driven by the very large annual payments customers make to us for maintenance. And again, we do that once a year, and then pull it out to that balance sheet item. So the number that's on the balance sheet is not huge. It's a part of what needs to happen and what will get recognized in the December-March quarter. But it's not the majority piece. The majority of it is just things that are not on the balance sheet today and will get recognize as we hit milestones.
Charles Rhyee: And just to clarify something you said earlier, I think in response to some else's question, between implementation that will just occur naturally versus revenues tied to certification. You said the vast majority is tied to the implementations?
Jeff Campbell: Yes.
John Hammergren: Thank you, and I want to thank the operator and everybody on the call today for your time. We had a very solid first half, and I'm optimistic about the many opportunities that lie ahead. I'll now hand the call over to Ana for her review of upcoming events for the financial community. Ana?
Ana Schrank: Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events. On November 11, we will present at the Crédit Suisse Healthcare Conference in Phoenix. On November 17, we will present at the Lazard Capital Markets Healthcare Conference in New York. On January 10, we will present at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. We will release third quarter earnings results in late January. We look forward to seeing you at one of these upcoming events. Thank you, and goodbye.
Operator: With that, we'll conclude today's conference call. Thank you again for your participation. Have a nice day.

===== 2011 Q1  (2010-07-30 08:30:00) =====

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the McKesson Corporation Fiscal 2011 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would like to now introduce Ms. Ana Schrank, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Ana Schrank: Thank you, Augusta. Good morning, and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2011 First Quarter Earnings Call. With me today are John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and Jeff Campbell, our CFO. John will first provide a business update, and we'll then introduce Jeff, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After Jeff's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after an hour at 9:30 Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meanings of Federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Thanks, and here is John Hammergren.
John Hammergren: Thanks, Ana, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Today we reported a solid start to fiscal 2011. For the first quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $27.5 billion and fully diluted earnings per share of $1.10. Our first quarter performance positions us well for the remainder of the fiscal year, and we continue to expect McKesson should earn between $4.72 and $4.92 per diluted share. Before I turn the call over to Jeff for a detailed review of our financial results, I thought I would highlight the trends in both segments of our business. Distribution Solutions started the year with solid growth and operating margin expansion. Operating profit was up 17%, including the $51 million antitrust settlement we talked about during our fourth quarter call. Excluding this settlement, the operating profit margin in Distribution Solutions expanded by four basis points as we continued to benefit from our generics offering across our Distribution businesses. If you take a moment to think back several years, you will recall that our discussions about our generics offering were mainly focused on progress we were making penetrating the independent segment of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. Today, when we talk about generics, our discussions encompass the broader array of customer-centric programs available throughout McKesson. In U.S. Pharmaceutical, our proprietary generics program, OneStop, is available to customers regardless of whether they are independent, retail chain, hospital or long-term care. Just importantly, our generics programs are available across different geographies and across multiple business units such as specialty and Medical-Surgical. With a favorable generics environment this year and our comprehensive offering, we anticipate continued profit growth in generics for fiscal 2011, and we have confidence that we are building a multi-year period of strong generics growth. The revenues for our Specialty Distribution business are included in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. Specialty Distribution is performing extremely well. We are wrapping up the final part of our very successful Centers for Disease Control and Preventions program to deliver the H1N1 flu vaccine. In addition, this quarter, we had another strong contribution from oxaliplatin. This drug is a good example of how we benefit from generics across our business. In our Medical-Surgical business, revenues were flat for the first quarter, but I would remind you that last year in the first quarter, this business benefited from the demand resulting from the H1N1 virus. We expect Medical-Surgical will continue to have slower top-line growth until we see more of an economic recovery, which would translate into better employment rates and more physician visits. We also expect a normal flu season this year. I'm very pleased we've been able to grow in spite of the softness we've seen in the market. Physician office visits are off somewhat. In this business, we are very focused on optimizing our sourcing of McKesson-branded products, and we continue to drive leverage through aggressive cost management. Combined, these initiatives are resulting in margin expansion. Our Canadian Distribution business had solid performance in the first quarter. McKesson Canada has leading positions in every market segment. We offer a comprehensive set of solutions and have close relationships with our customers. This is a terrific business for us. As you know, there are significant differences between the Canadian and U.S. markets. In Canada, drug prices, price increases, patient reimbursement and wholesaler up-charges are regulated by the government. Recently, provincial governments have been seeking to reduce the budget deficits that resulted from stimulus spending during the economic downturn. Drug spending by the government has been targeted as a way to reduce costs. As a result, there have been public policy changes in Canada that have the potential to impact our performance. Over the past several months, the provinces of Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia announced and enacted drug reform that will result in price cuts on most generic drugs by up to 50% over the next three years. Québec has recently announced its intention to implement a similar effort, but final details are not yet available. The government has provided some offsets for this, and we continue to work with all of our stakeholders on mitigation strategies. Going forward, it is our goal to grow our footprint in Canada, expanding our offering in high-growth segments such as Specialty Distribution. For fiscal 2011, we expect the potential impact from Canada regulations to be manageable within our guidance range. Overall, we are well positioned to continue to have a thriving business in Canada. I'm pleased with the first quarter performance in Distribution Solutions, with solid revenue growth and margin expansion, and I have confidence in our full year business performance. Turning now to Technology Solutions. While the results are in line with our expectations for the first quarter, they are not indicative of our performance we expect from the business over the long term. As we said during our fiscal year-end call and again at our Investor Day, we did expect our first quarter results to be down quite significantly, and while we continue to expect modest improvements to our full year operating profit margin, that improvement will be heavily weighted to the back half of our fiscal year. Within our Technology Solutions segment, we have three large businesses. Two of them, our payor-facing Health Solutions business and our RelayHealth Connectivity business, showed steady results year-over-year in the June quarter. The drop in segment operating profit in the first quarter stems from our hospital-facing Provider Technology business, where we are investing heavily in our enterprise revenue management and clinical solutions. I'm pleased to report that we continue to experience high levels of bookings for stimulus-related clinical products, and we are committed to the rapid deployment of these software solutions so we can support our customers in their efforts to achieve meaningful use. Taking a step back from the quarter results, we are very pleased with the recent progress that we've made with the Department of Health and Human Services released the final rules for meaningful use and certification standards for electronic health record systems. The rules were generally consistent with the recommendations we had submitted during the comment period. By creating two categories of requirements, core and menu, providers now have the flexibility to achieve meaningful use by taking different paths when implementing an EHR system based on their individual needs and priorities, which we believe is critical to broad-based adoption. We believe this positions more providers to participate in the program in a timely manner. We remain focused on working with our customers to make sure that they have the right resources in place to qualify for stimulus money. For more than a year, McKesson has been actively moving our EHR systems towards having the capabilities our customers need to achieve the proposed objectives. The official certification process has not been fully delineated. However, we are on track to submit our EHR systems for initial certification as soon as we have a clear indication of the process, and we believe we are well positioned to achieve certification of our EHR systems. Our strategy in Technology Solutions remains the same: to help providers reduce cost while improving quality, safety and efficiency through automation and connectivity. McKesson has a comprehensive set of products and services to achieve this goal. In summary, we're off to a good start to fiscal 2011. In addition to solid operating performance, our strong balance sheet and tremendous cash flow provides us with opportunities to deploy capital to advance our long-term strategic objectives. In the first quarter, we executed a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program, and we also announced a 50% increase to our dividend. Both the share repurchase and the dividend increase demonstrate our confidence in our business and our future cash flow generation. We plan to continue our portfolio approach to capital deployment, and you should expect a mixture of share repurchases and acquisitions that will advance our mission: to improve the quality and safety of the health care system. I believe we are well positioned for continued success. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?
Jeff Campbell: Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As you just heard, McKesson is off to another solid start to the fiscal year, led by the performance of our Distribution Solutions segment and the continued strength of our balance sheet. As usual, I'll begin with a review of our consolidated results, and then I'll provide additional color as I discuss each segment. Consolidated revenues were $27.5 billion for the quarter, up 3% from the prior year, with both segments contributing to this growth. On this 3% revenue growth, gross profit for the quarter increased 7% to $1.4 billion. As we discussed during our May earnings call, when we first gave guidance for fiscal 2011, the first quarter in our current fiscal year benefited from a $51 million antitrust settlement. Excluding this antitrust settlement, which flowed through our gross profit line, our gross profit margin was flat. The steady gross profit leverage we saw in Distribution Solutions driven by generics was offset by a decline in the Technology Solutions gross margin, which I'll come back to later. Moving below the gross profit line. First quarter operating expense increased 9% to $918 million due to higher employee compensation and benefit costs, increased investment in our Technology Solutions segment and foreign exchange rate movements. As you recall, last year, our operating expenses grew sequentially as we progressed through the year and gained more confidence in the strength of our businesses. We entered fiscal 2011 at the run rate at which we finished fiscal 2010. As a result, our year-over-year comparisons will show the kind of growth you saw this quarter until we get into the back half of this year, when they should moderate significantly. For the full year, I would expect our operating expense growth to be fairly modest, as we expected when we first provided guidance for fiscal 2011 last quarter. As one other reminder about operating expense, as you recall, last year's operating expense benefited from the favorable legal settlement related to the company's 401(k) plan. This resulted in us having little expense related to our 401(k) plan in fiscal 2010. For the current fiscal year, we now expect full year 401(k)-related expenses will be close to $60 million. Other income was fairly flat for the quarter at $9 million. Interest expense declined $5 million versus the prior year to $43 million, driven primarily by the repayment of $215 million in long-term debt in March of fiscal 2010. Moving to taxes. Our effective tax rate, 32.3%, is generally in line with the 32% we expect for the full year and is slightly higher than the 31.6% effective tax rate in the first quarter a year ago. Net income in the quarter was $298 million, up 3% from the prior year. Our diluted EPS from continuing operations was $1.10 for the quarter, an increase of 4% compared to the prior year. To wrap up our consolidated results, this quarter's diluted weighted average shares was flat year-over-year at 272 million shares. Let me take just a minute to explain how the accelerated share repurchase program impacted our share count this quarter. As we've previously disclosed, on May 17, we entered into an accelerated share buyback agreement to repurchase $1 billion of the company's common stock. While this had some impact on our share count this quarter, the full impact won't be felt until later this year since the agreement was only implemented midway through the June quarter. As an aside, the ASR program officially concluded this week, which was somewhat earlier than we had originally thought. Overall, on our share count, as we discussed at our Investor Day in June, we continue to expect our full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding to come in at our original guidance of 267 million. Let's now move on to our segment results. In Distribution Solutions, overall revenue growth was 3% compared to the same quarter last year. Looking at the components, total U.S. Pharmaceuticals Distribution and Services revenue grew 2% for the quarter. As we've discussed, over the past several quarters, we do continue to see a shift from warehouse to direct revenues. Canada revenues on a constant-currency basis grew 5% for the quarter, primarily due to market growth rates and one additional sales day. Including the favorable currency impact of 15%, Canada revenues grew 20% for the quarter. Medical-Surgical distribution revenues were flat for the quarter at $686 million. As you recall, though, the prior year benefited from increased demand related to the H1N1 flu virus, and the current quarter benefited from two small acquisitions we made in mid-fiscal 2010. Adjusting for these two items, Medical-Surgical distribution revenues grew at about 2% this quarter. Gross profit in the segment was up 12% to $1.1 billion for the quarter, a strong performance, with $51 million of the increase coming from the pretax antitrust settlement that we discussed earlier. Excluding the antitrust settlement, gross profit would still be up a solid 6%, resulting in a 13-basis-point improvement in gross margin. The primary driver of this profit growth in the quarter was strong growth in our generic profits. Our Distribution Solutions operating expense was up 7% to $568 million for the quarter. This year-over-year increase is driven by the same sequential timing issues I talked about earlier for the company overall. For the full year, I would expect the increase to be more modest. Operating margin rates for the quarter were 189 basis points versus 166 basis points in the prior-year quarter. Excluding the antitrust settlement, we are showing a four-basis-point margin improvement year-over-year in this segment. All in all, we saw a very solid start to the year in Distribution Solutions. Turning now to Technology Solutions. Total revenues grew 2% for the quarter to $759 million. Services revenue increased 1% for the quarter, a little bit slower growth than what you've seen in the past. A modest amount of Services revenue is tied to software implementations, and the pace of these implementations has slowed due to the higher mix of the more complex enterprise revenue management and clinical software solutions. Software and software systems revenues of $135 million in the quarter grew 4% from a year ago. Hardware revenues were up 21% for the quarter, as this line has a fair amount of quarterly volatility. Technology Solutions gross profit declined by 7% to $325 million, which is in line with our original expectations for the quarter. As we told you back on May 3, we stepped up our investments in the latter half of fiscal 2010 in this segment in order to ensure we had the right resources to successfully implement our customers' clinical and next generation of enterprise revenue management solutions. A large majority of these investments are reflected in our gross profit results. I'd also remind you that our Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management solution became generally available late in the second quarter of fiscal 2010, triggering an incremental $8 million of amortization expense for the quarter. You will continue to see this impact our year-over-year gross profit growth until it is fully lapped in the third quarter of the current fiscal year. Technology Solutions operating expenses increased 6% in the quarter to $262 million. Higher expenses in this segment were driven by continued investment in research and development activities as well as the general ramp-up of investment spending we have discussed. To be specific, Technology Solutions had total gross R&D spending of $105 million compared to $98 million in the prior year. Of these amounts, we capitalized 14% this year compared to 18% a year ago. Our operating profit in our Technology Solutions segment this quarter was $64 million, down 38% from $103 million a year ago. Operating margins were 8.43% for the quarter compared to 13.8% in the prior year, primarily due to the decline in gross profit discussed earlier and increased investment in research and development activities. Leaving our segment performance and turning briefly to the balance sheet and our working capital metrics. Our receivables increased 4% to $7.8 billion versus $7.5 billion a year ago, and our days sales outstanding were flat at 23 days. Compared to a year ago, inventories were up 9% to $9.4 billion, and payables were also up 9% to $13.3 billion. So our days sales and inventory of 33 days was up two days from a year ago, while our days sales and payables increased three days from a year ago to 46 days. These working capital metrics contributed to us generating $528 million in operating cash flow in the quarter, a good start to the year. Going forward, we continue to expect to generate approximately $1.5 billion in full year cash flow from operations. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.3 billion, down slightly from our year-end balance of $3.7 billion. Our ability to deliver consistent operating cash flows, along with our strong balance sheet, uniquely positions us to create shareholder value through the continued use of our portfolio approach to capital deployment. As part of this approach, we were pleased to launch this quarter both the $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program and the 50% increase in our dividend. Property acquisitions and capitalized software expenditures combined were essentially flat with the prior year at $87 million, and we continue to expect our capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million. Now to conclude. Our first quarter results were solid and on track. Our guidance range remains at earnings from continuing operations of $4.72 to $4.92 per fully diluted share. For clarity, let me make just one other point about this range. As you saw in our press release, after the quarter ended, we completed the sale of our McKesson Asia-Pacific business. As a result of the sale, we will record a pretax gain in the second quarter of approximately $94 million, which we will show in the discontinued operations line. For modeling purposes, this business is primarily reflected in the services revenue line within our Technology Solutions segment and rolls up to our Payor business, with revenues running approximately $21 million per quarter and profits being insignificant. Also as you know, we give guidance based on our earnings from continuing operations. So this transaction and the gain on it will not have an impact on our EPS guidance range. In summary, we feel our first quarter results provide us with a solid foundation for another good year. Thank you for joining us this morning, and with that, I will turn the call over to the Operator for your questions. I would ask that you limit your questions to just one per person to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator?
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: I guess on the Distribution side, you primarily highlighted generics as being a driver in the quarter. At the Investor Day, I thought maybe there was a little bit more to it in terms of timing of some price increases and things. So can you just maybe go into the profit increase there a little bit further?
Jeff Campbell: Well, I guess I'd make two comments on that, Tom. For the year, as you recall, the assumption we had on branded price increases to the modest extent they still impact our P&L, was that the price increases would run pretty much in line with what we saw in the prior year. We're only 90 days in, but I'd say 90 days in, that still seems like a reasonable assumption to us. You are correct that there's always some quarterly differences and timing in terms of when some of our compensation from the branded manufacturers comes in. When you look at the June quarter we just ended, just due to timing, it was down from the prior year, but actually a little bit better than we had originally anticipated when, way back in May, I first made some directional comments about what we thought our June quarter results would be.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Any color you could offer on inventory and the payables there that you saw the increase on?
Jeff Campbell: Again, there's also quarterly volatility on the inventory side. I think what's important to note here is that we actually had a very good cash flow quarter, probably a little bit better than we had anticipated. And so while you saw the DSIs up a little bit, you see the days sales and payables up by a little greater amount. That's really just the timing of when we made certain buys, and you see that in the fact that both of those rose fairly equally and will probably both work down fairly equally as we go through the next couple of months.
Operator: Our next question will come from Robert Willoughby of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Robert Willoughby: Can you give us the actual shares at the end of the quarter? And say again what your goal for the years in terms of fully diluted shares were? And then just one for John, the media has you buying assorted assets around the globe. Can you put any parameters at all on what you may or may not be up to you on that front?
Jeff Campbell: So let me, John, I'll take the mechanics of our share calculation, and then you can talk a little bit about the broader questions. On the mechanics of the shares, Bob. So as you'll see in our Q, the actual number of shares outstanding on June 30 was about a little over 261 million. Of course, our fully diluted share calculation, which was 272 million for the quarter, has to do that on an average daily basis and then, very importantly, add the fully diluted shares. So when you look at the number year-over-year, we, of course, have a much higher stock price, which is a very good thing. We have a much higher stock price this year than we did a year ago, so that drove a pretty significant increase in the dilution impact of options that are outstanding, and that drove the share price up a little bit. When you think about the full -- or excuse me, the number of shares outstanding used in the fully diluted calculation. When you think about the full year, I'd say we're still tracking to the original assumption that we think the full year number will be 267 million shares outstanding.
Robert Willoughby: Great.
John Hammergren: And, Bob, on the acquisition front, we don't ever comment specifically about what we're doing, but I certainly can comment directionally on how we do some of these rumors and speculations. First of all, we hear some of the same rumors you hear, and sometimes, we're not involved in the activities at all. And actually, when we inquire, the companies that are purportedly for sale aren't for sale, and somebody is trying to either, on the media side, to generate a story or sometimes, potentially, bankers are trying to generate interest in a company that may not have an interest in a transaction. Secondly, sometimes there are real sales activities going on, and I think our company views anything in health care around the globe, frankly, as, at a minimum, a learning experience for us to at least view the opportunity and take a look at the financial and strategic implications of moving forward in any kind of a transaction. And I think on behalf of our shareholders, we have a responsibility to remain globally aware of what’s going on in health care. And then lastly, I'd comment that any smart banker would always have us included in a deal even if we're not, just in an effort to make sure that fair price is being paid for the asset. So I've seen occasions where we're not involved in a deal or we’ve long since moved on in our minds, but yet we're still purportedly involved heavily at the final stages of negotiation for whatever reasons that you guys could dream up. So thinking in a broader context, what would we look at and actually want to buy? As I've mentioned in the past, we don't necessarily feel constrained, necessarily, geographically or even size-related. We feel more constrained about whether or not it makes financial sense, and it makes it through that gate and that hurdle, then we can actually create value for our shareholders, both with and without synergies and what is our dependence on synergies, what is our likely probability of realizing those synergies. And then if we get past those financial gates, then the question is sort of the strategic implications of making those moves. As Jeff mentioned in his comments, we do believe a portfolio approach to capital deployment is the best way to create value. We plan to continue that approach. You’ve seen evidence of the share repurchases and the dividend increase recently. On the acquisition front, we've not been very active in the last 18 months, and primarily due to valuations, many of the assets that we think might make sense for us strategically, as I said, don't make it through the first gate. And lastly, I'd say you see tremendous evidence of our discipline, both in terms of our performance from an acquisition perspective retrospectively, but also in our ability to sell assets that we might feel are valuable to us and meet the needs of our strategy. But frankly, we can't produce the same financial result over a long-term view that we could realize on a DCF basis very quickly. And so Jeff talked once again about the amount of, I think, tremendous cash flow we've generated from a company that was well-run and strategic to us. But frankly, we were offered a price that made sense for us to stop and listen, and we executed the transaction. So I think that discipline and that lack of sort of being married to being global or not being global, having an asset or not having an asset and thinking about it in a more analytical context will drive value for our shareholders, and it demonstrates our discipline.
Operator: Our next question will come from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan.
Lisa Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co: John, AmerisourceBergen talked about signing an agreement with Glaxo on the fee-for-service side. Have you signed one as well, number one? And number two, are you seeing any changes in sourcing on the generic product side? We've heard about different manufacturers, especially in India, having manufacturing problems and therefore having less supply in the market.
John Hammergren: Well, on the specific question regarding the branded supplier, we typically don't talk about our branded relationships or the agreements that we have with our partners. All I could say is that we have had a long-term, very positive relationship with Glaxo, and we're pleased with that relationship. And we continue to benefit -- both parties, I think, benefit from that partnership, and we would expect nothing to change as we look out. And on the generic sourcing side, I think our team does a good job of making sure that we are partnering with the people that have the adequate supply and adequate quality. Those are the first two parameters we deal with before we ever get to the price discussion, and so our job is to make sure we navigate through the challenges of availability by picking the right people upfront. So we are not expecting any generic shortage in the major lines of partnership that we have.
Lisa Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And do you think that, that helps you, just given your relationships, that maybe some others can't get product? Are you seeing any difference in purchasing patterns from your customers because of this?
John Hammergren: Well, I'd say that I think our scale matters. We're a very important partner to the generics and, frankly, to the branded companies, and I think that they do everything they can to assure that we have supply and that we can meet the obligations that we set out for our customers. One of the reasons that our customers do business with us is because we provide that shock absorber from a supply perspective. When their demand spikes, we usually can handle it, and when supply becomes constrained, we have the ability, typically, to manage our way through it. And I think that as an industry, wholesalers have demonstrated our ability to help make sure that our customers, frankly, across the board are getting better service levels outbound from us than we receive inbound from the manufacturers on many occasions.
Lisa Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co: I think the question, though, is from the other side, John. So because you're in that position, are you finding that, perhaps, someone that was buying direct before is saying, “Well, I had trouble getting the product. I know McKesson can get it for me. I'm going to buy more of my generics from them going forward because of this issue?”
John Hammergren: I think that's absolutely correct, Lisa. I think you actually are seeing increases in our DSD lines as people are moving away from the warehousing model to the Direct Store Delivery models. And I think that's really related to our ability to provide tremendous service at a very low cost. And so I absolutely believe that our customers are relying more and more on McKesson to provide product and are going to continue to move their purchases, whether direct on the brand or direct on the generic side, to McKesson.
Operator: We'll go next to Lawrence Marsh of Barclays Capital.
Lawrence Marsh - Barclays Capital: My question really is a comment on your customers and customer consolidation, and then a quick follow-up on Canada. I mean, based on your public statements on service, a lot of mail providers, including Aetna and CVS, obviously the consolidation there would suggest that there's still a relationship going forward. Are you in a position to comment at all about what sort of impact that might have around your generic buying program? And then, any impact in terms with the Omnicare window? Which, congratulations, it seems to be extended for another five years.
John Hammergren: On the customer consolidation front, as you mention, we do have a relationship with Aetna and, obviously, one with CVS Caremark, particularly on the mail side. So I think the nuances there are the slight differences that may exist between those relationships, and I think that we have a very positive relationship with both parties and plan to continue. On the Omnicare renewal, obviously we've had a very long-term partnership with Omnicare, and we’re really pleased to have renewed that relationship. And as is typically the case, I don't comment about specific customers, but both on the supplier side and the customer side, every year, we renew roughly a third of our business. And so those renewals, typically, are a benefit to us, and we continue to demonstrate our benefit to our customers, and that's why we retain the business. And Larry, I'm not sure what the question was on Canada.
Lawrence Marsh - Barclays Capital: Yes, I’m sorry. Yes, just a clarification. When do you think you'll have resolution around some of the provinces' attempts to cut back? And if I'm doing my math correctly, I mean, is worst case it could be $0.03 to $0.05 that could be offset other places in your guidance this year? Or is that too much?
John Hammergren: I think that's a little aggressive. As both Jeff and I mentioned, we are concerned with changes to reimbursement in Canada, especially if it happens all at once. But our job is to mitigate those changes, both at the government level, to make sure we’re negotiating to make sure that we maintain our profit stream. Because out of all of the people that are affected from a generic perspective, we have the least amount of margin rate and, therefore, can make the argument that we provide great utility value and our profit structure should be protected. So mitigation strategies are always part of our overall approach. And I think from a materiality perspective, we said that the changes we might experience this year are clearly, we believe, captured in the boundaries of our guidance. So albeit we admit that there's a negative here relative to generic reimbursement in Canada, we believe it's manageable. And over the long haul, if you think about our Canadian position, we actually are very optimistic that we'll continue to have momentum in that business and in that marketplace, and we're expanding our footprint in our offering, as I mentioned in my comments about Specialty, our Technology businesses. So we are actively expanding our business in Canada and are well-respected for the role we play.
Lawrence Marsh - Barclays Capital: Very good. Okay.
Operator: We'll go next to Ross Muken with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG: Could you elaborate a little more on what you're seeing in the Technology Solutions business pre and post sort of the definition of meaningful use? And in terms of the activity and the types of products or the types of hospitals, the physician offices where you're seeing the most activity, any color would be helpful.
John Hammergren: Sure, Ross. The Technology Solutions business is continuing to focus on, really, the demand for clinical products, as our customers are racing to get these products installed and ready. As I mentioned also in my comments, we're pleased that the government has allowed for a multiple approach to accomplishing meaningful use, and we think that multifaceted approach will facilitate our customers actually achieving the results that they're after. Our technology and the other part of that meaningful-use process is making sure they’re using certified products. And as I also mentioned, that we believe that our products will be certified once we get the party that needs to do the certification put in there and we have a body to go to. Our development work right now is to make sure that our product continues to have the components necessary as defined by meaningful use and that we have the implementation and installation people on hand to make that happen. Now turning to doctor offices, we are not really seeing an acceleration in buying at that level. So when I talk about our booking strength in clinical products, frankly, we have a large footprint in physician offices, so I don't think we're losing any share to others. I would just comment that I don't think those doctor offices are yet focused on their requirement from an EHR perspective. So we're seeing a little bit of it in the hospital-related doctors. So when physicians are purchased by hospitals, that idea of getting them up on EHR's and integrating them with the McKesson inpatient products is important to them, but standalone documents, frankly, are still on the sidelines.
Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG: John, that’s very helpful. And maybe one for Jeff, just going back on the M&A angle. Valuations in the public market have been quite volatile as of late. Could you talk a bit about the complications that, that brings to actually getting a deal done? And how sellers are thinking about adjusting their expectations relative to what we've seen? And typically, based on times past, how long it takes for them to kind of get to a level that more reflects what we’re seeing in the public market?
Jeff Campbell: Well, John had a comment as well. I think the reality, Ross, is that there are few sellers I have run into in my entire career who don't pick the highest stock price that they've had over the last several years and say, “Obviously, I have to have a premium off of that price.” And they are remarkably oblivious to what the public market might be telling them about valuation. How long does it take to overcome that? I don't know, but if you think about John pointing out we haven't done an acquisition of scale in six to eight quarters, well, within that time frame, you have the real collapse of equity values that you saw beginning in the fall of 2008. And I think it's fair to say, John, that even though that collapse lasted for quite some time, I don't know that we found anyone of any significant note who suddenly said, “Yes, I'm going to sell my company based on the new public market valuation.”
John Hammergren: Yes, I think that's the case. I mean, I would agree with Jeff entirely that valuations are largely driven by the view that I should be back where I was and then put a premium on it. That said, I think that over time, people begin to become more realistic about the real value of their enterprise. And I think the other thing that we struggle with, frankly, on the smaller acquisitions is they already have a premium built in for a takeover by us or one of our larger competitors. So they come to us with a built-in premium, and you'll even see sometimes the sell-side reports say, “Well, the stability in this stock will be held up. Even though their performance is waning, the stability will be held up, because they're going to be bought if they drop too low.” Well, that obviously feeds that view that they have a floor on their PEs or a floor on their valuations that is driven by performance when, in fact, the floor is driven by the optics of us coming in to buy. So it makes it challenging for us. And so we need to be patient, we need to work these deals over time and we need to convince ourselves and potentially the target owners that the kind of valuations that we might be willing to pay are more realistic. So I think that's our view.
Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG: Great. Makes me glad I changed careers.
Operator: We'll go next to the John Ransom of Raymond James.
John Ransom - Raymond James & Associates: Does the Lovenox news change the parameters at all about how you're thinking about fiscal '11?
John Hammergren: No, as we've talked about before, our Generic business manages a portfolio. And albeit we believe that generics over the current term and the long term are going to be very additive to our business, at any one point in time, products complicate and go, and most of the time, we have something budgeted or we have something reflected in our expectations around launches. Lovenox, for example, we probably had that view that this product was going to launch last year. So you just never know when things are going to happen, and we try to be prepared. We always have hits and misses, but Lovenox, from our view, was not a Dow mover to begin with.
John Ransom - Raymond James & Associates: Okay. And my other question just quickly is has anything changed in your dynamics with the retail pharmacy sector? We're just seeing stress there with weak front-end sales and A&P and reimbursement pressures. Is there anything that you're doing for them that's different than maybe two years ago?
John Hammergren: Well, I think, to your point, I think when customers come under pressure, their instinct is to attempt to get a better deal from their vendors. And I think given the training our sales force has and what we attempt to do is to give them a better deal through the value that we can deliver. So we're seeing an expansion in Health Mart. More stores are coming online. We’re seeing more interest in buying our generics. To the point was made earlier on the call, people are beginning to become more dependent on our ability to manage their inventory and their buys. And we can get access to product that might not be able to get access to. And so I think the symbiotic relationship between retail and wholesalers are actually reinforced when the market gets difficult, because we just do a terrific job of delivering value. As it relates specifically to a weakness at the storefront level or the outbound sales level, we do see that in our revenue line. So clearly, when our largest customers begin to tail off from a revenue perspective or if they lose market share, frankly, that's a direct reflection back into our business. So when they win, we win, and when they lose, we lose. And our goal is to continue to try to bolster their performance as much as we can, but they've got to win patients at the front counter. Otherwise, our model is negatively affected.
John Ransom - Raymond James & Associates: Okay.
Operator: Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs has our next question.
Robert Jones - UBS: Just a follow-up on the generic question. Obviously we've seen some positive updates since the Analyst Day and, not to get too far to the specifics, I was just wondering, as we look out over the course of this year, how are you thinking about the overall generic launch schedule relative to what we've seen over your fiscal 2010?
John Hammergren: I think as we came into this, we expected fiscal '11 to be slightly better than '10, and I think that's still our view. We think '11’s going to be a very good year. We think '12 is going to be a good year from a launch perspective, and as we see out, we're optimistic. I have to caveat that with: This is not an absolute science. Our guys downstairs are making guesses as to what quarter things might launch in, and that is an estimate. And we're also making estimates as to how many entrants will be in the market and what kind of margin rates we might realize from it. The one thing I can say to you, though, is, as we look over multi-quarter periods going out, we have a very positive outlook on how generics are going to affect the financial performance of our company. And we also have a very positive outlook on our ability to continue to expand the franchise of generics, as we've mentioned, beyond just independent pharmacies to larger retail players, now the hospital marketplace, long-term care, specialty and physician offices and Canada. So as you think about our generic portfolio, we think about it not geographically bounded and not business bounded, and our goal is to drive value for our customers through our ability to understand this market and where it's headed.
Robert Jones - UBS: That’s helpful. And then just along those lines quickly, on pricing. Could you maybe just comment on the generic pricing environment as we come into your fiscal '11 relative to maybe what we saw last year?
Jeff Campbell: Well, I'm not sure that there's significant differences. The model, really, is if there's a dozen players in a generic compound, the pricing is going to be lower than if there's just several players. And obviously, if it's an exclusive or co-exclusive kind of a launch, then the pricing is retained at a higher level, at least during that exclusivity period. So I don't think we've seen any difference, really, in the dynamics there. If there's a lot of people in the business of that specific compound or that particular strength or dosage, then we'll see prices erode more rapidly. And if there isn't, then the profit and the prices held up a little bit higher for a longer period of time. But what does happen is that, over time, these things begin to normalize, and we end up with a growing bolus of profit that is increasingly important to the company and continues to grow. And so I know there are people that say, “Well, what happens when there are fewer generic launches?” Clearly, our growth rates might decrease to some extent, but that pot of profit is not going to diminish and it is not going to disappear. And so it's just a question of how fast it expands, from our view.
Operator: We'll go next to Garen Sarafian from Citigroup.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc: The question is around utilization. We've heard some mixed messages on skort fines [ph] (1:00:12) utilization lately. So I'm curious if, John, you could elaborate your comments made in the prepared remarks regarding doc visits being off somewhat, if we could quantify that. And which businesses are you seeing the most impact? And what's making up for it?
John Hammergren: Well, thanks for the question. I think it is a complex question, and we only see a sample of the physician offices. We do have many businesses, though, that are involved in physician offices, which might give us a different view or, certainly, maybe a better view than others might have. As you know, we have a transaction processing business that brings the actual visit itself between the physician and the payor. From a reimbursement-cycle perspective, we get to see those transactions. So we do see frequency and we do see sort of the load on the doctors. We also see some people buying software at the physician office level, and then clearly, our footprint in Medical-Surgical, where we’re actually selling to the alternate site, in particular to the doctor offices, we get to see volume and have discussions with physicians at that level. So I do think we believe doc visits are down, and as a result there will be some moderation of the use of medical supplies and perhaps also a moderation in the amount of scrips being written. But I would say that we still believe that the scrip volume levels are okay. We're not seeing a step function change in scrip volumes. But once again, we are focused, really, on the pull-through in our business and what product is pulled through. So if scrip volumes are off with our customers because they’re losing share, that's a problem for us. If our scrip volumes are off with them in a branded way, but more is being converted to generics, we can have a little scrip volume degradation on brand if we have a scrip volume conversion increase on generics. From a financial perspective, that's a pretty good trade for us. It's an offset. So I think that there is some correlation, obviously, over time, but our models are slightly different than what a retailer might experience right at the counter.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc: And then previously, I think you had mentioned that IMS data is directionally correct, but the data recently is pretty choppy. I think the last couple of months, it went from negative back to a positive. Would you still say that, that data is directionally correct?
John Hammergren: Yes, I'd say we think it's directionally correct, but usually after we say directionally correct, we say it over time. But when you see these weekly and daily and monthly fluctuations and positive to negative, it's a little bit like other indicators, sometimes, in our economy. They're not right on a short-term basis. They're right on a longer-term basis as you smooth those lines. And so I think it is a indicator. It is not the indicator.
Operator: We'll go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: First of all, for the Technology segment, what percent of the year-over-year margin decline for the segment reflects the investments versus products mix? And then, similar question on the drug distribution side. What would be the growth rate for U.S. distribution, excluding some specific customer losses?
Jeff Campbell: Well, two things. Let me go backwards. On Distribution Solutions, we really didn't have any significant customer losses that we’re lapping anymore. I think, though, Ricky, your question is a good one. It is a fact that we have a couple of our largest customers whose buying patterns vary from quarter-to-quarter. And so a couple of our largest customers we actually saw lower purchases from year-over-year.
John Hammergren: Which could also be reflective of our inventory work.
Jeff Campbell: Right, and that's all I think it is. But just to give you some sense of the magnitude of that, if those customers had, had just flat purchases year-over-year, it would have added about two more points to our revenue growth this quarter. On the Technology Solutions side, I'd say pretty much all of what you see happening at the gross margin level is driven by the increased investment that we've been talking about for a while in our clinical software solutions and our next-generation enterprise revenue management solutions.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: So it fair for us, when we think about the models for that segment, to assume that if it wasn't for the investments, margins would have been flattish year-over-year?
Jeff Campbell: Yes.
Operator: We'll go next to Helene Wolk of Sanford Bernstein.
Helene Wolk - Bernstein Research: I just wanted to follow up on the Technology segment. I'm just understanding the sort of back-half acceleration in expected both demand as well as revenue recognition. What are you assuming? Or what's required, in terms of the certification process, to make that happen?
Jeff Campbell: Well, I'm not so sure that it's as dependent on the certification process, or even our customers accomplishing meaningful use, as much as it is our ability to recognize revenue through the successful implementation of those contracts. So there might be some dependence on some of our relationships where our certification is another one of the factors associated with the revenue recognition. That wouldn't be the case in, certainly, 100% of our clinical relationships. So the most important thing for us, regaining momentum in the back half of this year, is a combination of decreasing our investment in some of these areas from kind of a ramp-up perspective, but also, and perhaps most importantly, beginning to recognize revenue through the successful implementation. And another dependence, obviously, is our customer's ability to ramp up their resources to make those implementations successful. So I think that's really the key driver there, is the successful completion.
Helene Wolk - Bernstein Research: Great. And then one other question. You had mentioned earlier the contribution of generic Eloxatin. Are you willing to speak in terms of potential supply whether that carries you through the fiscal '11 time frame?
John Hammergren: Well, clearly want to be positioned to meet our customers’ needs, and I think we did a good job of preparing for that as this product was made available to us through our partnerships. So I think you can count on fact we’ll continue to have the product, certainly, into the end of our fiscal year. I think we have time for one more question, Operator.
Operator: And that will come from George Hill of Leerink Swann.
George Hill - Leerink Swann LLC: I guess, quick question with respect to the IT segment. I guess, if we're expecting to see the revenue pull through in the back half of the year, I'm wondering if you give us any color with respect to the magnitude of the pull-through. And, Jeff, is there any chance that you might give us an updated breakdown of the revenue components of the Technology segment, with respect to what is the life see [ph] (1:07:46) patient accounting systems? How much is the legacy per se business? How much is radiology? Just trying to understand the relative impact that we should see to the Technology business from clinical uptake.
John Hammergren: Well, I guess I'll try to start this, and I'm not sure we fully understand the questions, George, so stay on the line. Our revenue pull-through at the end of the year has to be quite dramatic for us to get to the guidance that we've given you as we started the year. We talked about the back-half load, and we also gave you a margin goal that we had in the business. And so we have significant dependency for that segment, in terms of accomplishing our segment level of guidance, that we get those implementations successfully installed. And in addition, we're able to recognize the revenue. So there’s two dependencies. We've got to get the stuff in our customers’ sights, and they have to help us do that. And the second thing is we have to have clear sailing relative to the way we view the accounting associated with this contracts to actually be able to recognize the revenue. So at this point, we still have confidence we will see the strength in the back half of the year, and our objective, certainly, is to continue to head in that direction. Jeff, I don't know if there's some other question that was asked that I missed there.
George Hill - Leerink Swann LLC: When I think about the Clinicals business, the EMR component that served the hospital physician practice business, I figured that it probably can't be a third of the total segment revenue. I don't think the business is going to be that size yet. That's why I'm just trying to understand, as we model going forward, I wouldn't expect that, that would lead to anything that approaches double-digit revenue growth in the segment. So I was just hoping that we could get an update on the size of the Clinicals business with respect to the size of the segment.
John Hammergren: Well, I think that's a difficult question to answer, but I don't think we'll get to double-digit revenue growth at the segment level simply driven by the Clinicals business. I think that's our view. As we've talked about in the past, there's a large transaction-processing business in there that is more of a software-as-a-service kind of model, where we get continued revenue. And that business certainly can grow nicely, but it is a steady grower. We also have our Payor business, which in the past, actually, has had some lumpy revenue characteristics with it. But that also is a strong part of our business. And then, as we’ve described, at our McKesson Provider Technologies is actually multiple businesses. We have our Medical Imaging business, we have our Legacy Financial Systems businesses, we have an Automation business. So those businesses are all part of that segment, and the Clinicals are but a sub-segment of that. Now having said that, I just said that our fourth quarter's dependent on our successful implementation of clinical contracts in terms of actually achieving the objectives that we've given you. So there is a significant amount of profit in clinical software sales, and that'll be necessary. But you're not going to drive the whole true success in the Clinical side in the fourth quarter. I don't think you're going to drive for the year double-digit revenue increases for the segment. That simply is difficult to do.
George Hill - Leerink Swann LLC: Okay. And, I guess, just lastly, the company is confident in its ability to get customers to meaningful use?
John Hammergren: Yes, we're absolutely confident in our ability to do our part of getting our customers to meaningful use. As you know, the meaningful-use criteria require adoption inside of the customer base relative to the utilization of these technologies. And so I think we have the expertise to help our customers do it, and our expectation is that most of our customers, if not all of them, will achieve meaningful use with our help. But clearly, it's not something we own solely on our own shoulders. What we do own solely on our own shoulders is a certification of our product, and we're confident we will get our product certified once those certification bodies and criteria are out there. So thank you, Operator. And I want to thank, also, all of you that have joined us on the call early this morning. At McKesson, we do start all of our days at 4:30 on the West Coast, so you should be confident that we work hard on your behalf. I'm very pleased with our first quarter performance and excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. I'll now turn the call over to Ana for some comments about our coming events. Ana?
Ana Schrank: Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events. On September 14, we will present at both the Morgan Stanley conference in New York and at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2010 Investment Conference in San Francisco. On September 15, we will present at the Stifel Nicolaus Health Care Conference in Boston. On November 11, we will present at the Credit Suisse Health Care Conference in Phoenix.

Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to McKesson Corporation Fiscal 2010 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ms. Ana Schrank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Ana Schrank: Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson fiscal 2010 fourth quarter earnings call. With me today are John Hammergren, McKesson's Chariman and CEO; and Jeff Campbell, our CFO. John will first provide a business update and we'll then introduce Jeff who will review the financial results for the quarter. After Jeff's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Thanks, and here is John Hammergren.
John Hammergren: Thanks, Ana, and thanks everyone for joining us on our call. We finished fiscal 2010 with fourth quarter revenues of $26.6 billion and net income of $348 million or $1.26 per diluted share. For the full year, excluding adjustments to litigation reserves in both years, net income grew 10% to $1.3 billion and earnings per share was up 13% to $4.58. Solid performance across the entire company contributed to our fiscal 2010 results. In Distribution Solutions, we successfully executed against the opportunities like the H1N1 flu vaccine initiative. We performed well for our branded pharmaceutical partners. And we continue to grow gross profit from our proprietary generics program. And we realized many benefits from our global sourcing activities. In Technology Solutions, we started the year in an economic downturn, which led to longer buying cycles and delayed implementations, but we're able to grow revenues in this segment. I'm pleased that in our fourth quarter, we had one of the highest levels of bookings ever. And we also had the highest full year operating margin in recent history. Last year's performance provides a good foundation for fiscal 2011 success. Moving on to some of the specifics for the quarter and the year. Distribution Solutions performed very well with solid contributions from all of our businesses. In U.S. Pharmaceutical, the team delivered terrific results despite the challenges we faced early in the year for some lost business and some margin pressure. Our commitment to our pharmaceutical distribution customers has never been stronger. This is reflected by the success we have demonstrated in each of our customers segments. For example, in our Retail National Accounts segment, we retained all of our accounts that were up for renewal in fiscal 2010. In the Independent segment, we were able to achieve profit growth with compliance programs that drove adoption of our value-added products, including our Health Mart franchise, which we increased by 500 stores this year. In our Hospital business, we saw continued success from new initiatives, such as our recently launched Plasma and BioLogics business. And we benefited from further penetrating our base of customers with our proprietary generics program. Across all of our customer segments, we focused on better generics compliance within our existing base and realized significant growth in generics gross profit. We also had a strong contribution from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. Included in our U.S. Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services results are the results of Specialty Care Solutions. This business had a tremendous year, successfully delivering on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention H1N1 flu vaccine program and benefiting from the launch of a generic, earlier in the year. Since October, we've shipped more than 126 million doses of the H1N1 vaccine and the related medical supply kits to thousands of providers across the country. Thanks to the team's leadership and hard work, we've earned high praise from our clients at the CDC. We are working with the CDC on a modest program to continue delivering the H1N1 flu vaccine through July 31. And we have significantly wind down our operations to match these reduced volumes. The H1N1 flu vaccine distribution initiative was not only the largest public health initiative in CDC history, it was also a significant event for McKesson. Never before have so many McKesson employees from across the company come together for a customer. I'm very proud of our team which work closely with the CDC to execute on this opportunity in one McKesson way. Turning to our other businesses in the Distribution Solutions segment. Our Medical Surgical business had a solid contribution to the overall success of Distribution Solutions. Medical Surgical's revenues grew significantly reflecting increased demand related to the flu and aided by acquisitions made in fiscal 2009. This business too was able to respond quickly to an anticipated demand related to the flu vaccine season. And the team organized immediately to respond to the unique market opportunity. That and aside the contribution from flu, our Medical Surgical business has demonstrated tremendous execution not just this year, but over the past three years as we focused on the alternate site markets. I'm pleased with our progress in this business, particularly the continued focus on expense control measures and global sourcing that McKesson branded products, which have led to improved operating results. Finally, our Canadian Distribution business had strong revenue growth and gains in market share. McKesson Canada continues to get operating leverage through investment in our distribution center network and increased participation in the corporation's global sourcing programs. I'm extremely pleased with our full year performance in Distribution Solutions. We've achieved strong results despite the challenges we faced coming into the year and we expect our momentum to continue. Next fiscal year at Distribution Solutions, we expect that our revenues will grow at market adjusted for our mix of business. Generics should continue to be a significant driver of margin expansion. We are headed into the year with a robust launch calendar. And we are well-positioned with our proprietary generics program, OneStop, which cuts across all of our customer segments in U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Care Solutions. On the branded drug side, we deliver a broad range of value-added services to the manufacturers, resulting in steady compensation. In fiscal 2011, we expect branded price inflation will be at similar levels to fiscal 2010. Overall, we have tremendous confidence in the continued success of Distribution Solutions and we remain steadfastly focused on delivering superior value to our customers. Turning now to Technology Solutions. We started our fiscal year during an economic downturn that lengthened as customer's buying cycles and implementation times stretched out. More recently, our customers access to capital has improved and they have better visibility into the stimulus requirements. These dynamics helped us with a strong finish to fiscal 2010, with software revenues up 5% in the fourth quarter. Our full year operating profit margin expanded to the highest level in recent history and it now approaches our goal of low to the mid-teens. While our Technology businesses is best known for market share leading products and solutions to support hospital and physician office customers, we do have a more diverse and robust offering. So let me take a moment to remind you of the major businesses that comprise Technology Solutions because each of them contributed significantly to our progress this year. Our largest technology business deliver solutions for hospitals. These providers have been focused on the stimulus this year and we have the market leading clinical systems and analytics they need to qualify for stimulus money. We also have solutions for hospitals that improve their performance by automating financial and administrative operations. And we recently introduced our next-generation revenue cycle system, Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management, where we are a leader in medical imaging solutions, as well as providing innovative capabilities in hospital pharmacy automation. Earlier in the year, we told you that stimulus has generated an increase customer interest in our solutions, but the interest had not yet been reflected in increase buying. As the year progressed, stimulus-related purchases accelerated and we a saw strong growth in new business in the fourth quarter, achieving the solid finish to the year. We are adding more Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management customers as our legacy hospitals are realizing that this solution will enable them to streamline their systems and improve their financial performance. In the physician market, we have a large footprint with more than 100,000 physicians using our solutions to improve both their office and clinical efficiency. We have a very complete offering for payors through our Health Solutions business, where our expert technology and evidence-based clinical information enables payors to manage their administrative and medical costs. And we are a leader, a longtime leader with an unmatched footprint. Our solutions today are used by the top 20 health plans in the United States, which cover 73% of the commercial lines. Health Solutions had its best performance ever, driven by a rapid adoption in several new products that we introduced into the marketplace earlier in the year, namely, Total Payment Solutions, Clear Coverage and Molecular Diagnostics. These products drove strong bookings within our installed base of customers. Through our Health Solutions business, we also run programs that focus on improving the health and wellness of Medicaid beneficiaries. For example, our program with the State of Illinoi has achieved net savings by the state of more than $300 million over a three-year period. By helping patients better manage chronic and acute illnesses, we assure that there are fewer unnecessary emergency room visits and hospital admissions. Finally, our RelayHealth Connectivity business differentiates our offering because we automate the operations in each care setting and support the flow of financial and clinical transactions between health systems, labs, physicians, pharmacies, payors, consumers and others. A significant portion of the meaningful use guidelines under the HITECH portion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, relate to the ability to exchange patient health information and approximately $564 million in stimulus funding is earmarked for health care information exchanges. This year, Relay closed its biggest clinical connectivity contract ever with Henry Ford Health System. The agreement is a good example of one McKesson, because it also included our Electronic Health Record Solutions for physician offices called Practice Partner. Q4 marked one of our highest levels of bookings in recent history for our Technology Solutions segment. Across the business, we have sharpened our focus on execution, innovation and collaboration to drive customer success.  In the back half of fiscal 2010, we invested more heavily to ensure that we have the resources necessary to successfully move our customers through the deployment process to qualify for stimulus money. We expect to make continued investment in the first half of fiscal 2011. But we are confident that we will see solid margin expansion in this segment for the full year. In summary, fiscal 2010 was a remarkable year defined by political and economic change. We pushed through the challenges and exercised financial discipline and successfully executed on opportunities to increase our business. Throughout the year, McKesson has been engaged in every step of the healthcare debate. We are very committed to our presence in Washington, where we attempt to share our expertise with the policy community.  The passage of the healthcare reform bill marks the most sweeping proposal for change through our industry in decades. It marks an important step toward expanding access to health insurance, yet the real work of transforming the nation's health care system is just beginning. To ensure ongoing access to affordable, high-quality health care, we must continue to address the underlying factors that keep our system from reaching the optimum levels of quality and cost effectiveness. As the largest healthcare services and technology company, McKesson is committed to working with all the participants in health care to develop innovations that address these issues, leading to our health care system that are simultaneously high-performing, accessible and economically sustainable.  Over time, our Distribution business should benefit from expanding health insurance coverage. Our Technology businesses should benefit from increased reporting requirements for case management and care coordination, along with initiatives to prevent hospital re-admissions and the complexity of ever-changing insurance reimbursement. And our Connectivity business should benefit from the adoption of standards from financial and administrative transactions to promote administrative simplification. We expect healthcare reform will help sustain our momentum. Now to wrap up. Our fiscal 2010 results provide us with a good foundation for continuous success in fiscal 2011. Both Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions are producing sound, operating results and very positive cash flow. Over time, we've used our portfolio approach for acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and internal investment, creating significant value for our shareholders. Our increased share repurchase authorization announced today maximizes our flexibility to begin deploying our significant cash balances and we will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities that will advance our mission to improve the quality and safety of the health care system. Based on the operating trends in our business, we expect earnings per diluted share of $4.72 to $4.92 for fiscal 2011.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?
Jeff Campbell: Well, thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As you've just heard, this is another solid operational quarter capping off a great year. In my remarks today, I'll cover both the fourth quarter and the full year results. As you've heard me say before, we provide our EPS guidance on an annual basis due to both seasonality and the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations that are inherent to our business.  In this context, an annual look at our financial results can provide more meaningful insight into some of the key trends. So I'll focus more on the annual numbers than the quarterly once today. And I'll also comment on what these trends might mean for fiscal 2011. My comments today will exclude the current year impact of the litigation reserve release and the prior year's AWP litigation charge. As usual, I'll begin with a review of our consolidated results followed by a more detailed discussion of each segment. Consolidated revenues for both the full year and quarter were up 2%. And we ended the full year with revenues of $108.7 billion. Both segments contributed to this revenue growth, each demonstrating resilience, given the tough economic environment. Gross profit was up 6% to $5.7 billion for the year and up 8% to $1.6 billion for the quarter, giving us nice leverage on the 2% revenue growth. For the year, both segments contributed to this increase in our gross profit margin. Moving now to operating expenses. As we entered fiscal 2010, we enacted strong cost containment measures across the company in response to the tough economic environment, which resulted in lower year-over-year operating expense in the first two quarters of fiscal 2010.  As we begin to outperform our original expectations, we chose to make certain investments in both segments to support the business and build a better foundation for the future. This resulted in modest operating expense increases in the latter half of fiscal 2010. In line with this trend, our full year operating expense was flat year-over-year at $3.7 billion, while our fourth quarter operating expense was up 4%. Also as a reminder, in fiscal 2010, our operating expense benefited from a legal settlement impacting the company's 401(k) plan, which resulted in us having little expense related to our 401(k) plan in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2011, we expect our expense associated with the voluntary contributions to our company's 401(k) plan to return to approximately $58 million. Overall, considering all these impacts, our fiscal 2011 outlook reflects a modest increase in operating expense going forward. Next, our operating income was up 18% to $2 billion for the full year and up 15% to $573 million for the quarter. This performance is really driven by both the growth in the gross margin, I described earlier, combined with the leverage we achieved at the operating expense line.  Increasingly, we have moved our focus to measuring our operating expense leverage relative to our gross profit. For our Distribution segment, in particular, as generic conversions have grown over the years, this metric has become more relevant than viewing our operating expense leverage relative to revenue. So looking at our operating expense on the more relevant metric as a percentage of gross profit, operating expense for the company was just 65% for fiscal 2010 compared to 69% in the prior year. Moving down the P&L for the full year. Other income was impacted by several factors. In both the current and prior year, we had a gain on sale of the business. And then last year's fourth quarter, we had $63 million of impairment charges. Excluding these one-time items, other income was down significantly compared to the prior year, driven by lower short-term interest rates. Interest expense increased for the full year and quarter due to the debt we issued in February of fiscal 2009. Moving to taxes. We ended the year with an effective tax rate of 32.2%, which is slightly higher than our original fiscal 2010 guidance of 32%. Let me remind you that our fiscal 2009 tax provision was favorably impacted by $111 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items. Looking at just the fourth quarter tax rate, however, we did have a number of catch-up adjustments that drove our quarterly tax rate up to 35%. This was about $0.05 to $0.06 above of what we had expected when we last gave you guidance in January, $0.01 of this reflects our expense associated with the recently enacted health care reform law related to the elimination of a tax benefit for retiree prescription drug coverage. The weighted average diluted shares outstanding declined in both the full year and the quarter. The cumulative impact of shares repurchase lowered our full year diluted weighted shares average outstanding by 2% year-over-year to 273 million shares. You do see, however, that our fourth quarter number of $275 million was above the full year, as we did not repurchase any shares later in fiscal 2010. Our guidance for fiscal 2011 builds in an assumption that our share repurchase activity resumes, which is reflected in our weighted average diluted shares assumption for 2011 of 267 million. To wrap up our consolidated results, our full year diluted EPS from continuing operations was $4.58 versus $4.07 in the prior year, an increase of 13%. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $1.26 for the quarter compared to $1.01 in the prior year, which was unfavorably impacted by $0.22 of impairment charges. So all in all, we're pleased with the growth that we achieved in fiscal 2010 given the headwinds we faced at the beginning of the year. So let's move on now to the segments. In Distribution Solutions, overall revenues were up 2% for the full year and quarter. Looking at the components of this revenue, our total U.S. Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services revenues grew 1% for the full year and were flat for the quarter. The full year was impacted by the losses in late fiscal 2009 of several customers that we have previously discussed.  The fourth quarter was also impacted by lower purchases from two of our large retail national chain customers. Given the size of these customers and the volumes associated with them, their purchasing patterns and business wins and losses can obviously have an effect on our revenue growth. Turning to the split between direct and warehouse sales. Over the past year, we have repeatedly commented on a shift from warehouse purchases to direct store delivery by a large customer. This mix shift is the primary driver of the increase in Direct Distribution revenues and similar decline in warehouse revenues for the full year.  Canadian revenues on a constant currency basis were 7% for the full year and 3% for the quarter, primarily driven by market growth. Medical-Surgical Distribution revenues were up 8% for the full year and 5% for the quarter, primarily driven by the positive impact of the flu, as well as several small acquisitions we made.  Gross profit in this segment increased 7% for the full year and 11% for the quarter, resulting in a nice improvement in our gross profit margin. Several factors contributed to the increase in gross profit, and these drivers have consistently impacted our results throughout the fiscal year. Our Distribution Solutions operating expenses declined 1% for the year but increased 3% for the quarter, in line with the overall trends I discussed earlier. For the full year, operating profit grew 20% to $2 billion.  As we've discussed the last several quarters, increased demand from the flu season was a significant driver of this increase. We told you 90 days ago on our last call that we expected the total incremental flu impact across all of our Distribution Solutions businesses to be in the range of $0.35 to $0.40 for fiscal 2010. We, in fact, ended the year right in the middle of this range.  Excluding this incremental impact of flu and the favorable settlement related to our company's 401(k) plan that I discussed earlier, our full year operating margin in Distribution Solutions was 172 basis points. This is a 13 basis point improvement from the prior year and represents a real demonstration of the strength of the longer-term trends in these businesses. In summary and before I move on to Technology Solutions, we're very pleased with the strong performance delivered by our Distribution Solution businesses this year, as they effectively mitigated the challenges we faced at the beginning of the fiscal year. Turning now to Technology Solutions. Overall revenues were up 2% for the full year to $3.1 billion and also up 2% for the fourth quarter to $820 million. Services revenues grew 4% to $2.4 billion for the year, and 2% to $627 million for the quarter, reflecting the more stable nature of these revenues.  Software and Software Systems revenues were flat for the year, but up 5% for the quarter. As John mentioned, we had historically high bookings in the March quarter but we also had a higher software deferral rate, due to the more complex nature of the products that were sold. To be specific, our software revenue deferral rate was up nine points to 80% for the full year, and up 11 points to 83% for the quarter. These strong bookings and high deferral rates provide a clear focus for us in the coming year to efficiently implement our customer solutions and convert these deferred revenues in the bottom line results. Technology Solutions gross profit increased 2% to $1.5 billion for the full year, roughly in line with our revenue growth. Gross profit for the quarter is flat compared to the prior year. Technology Solutions operating expenses declined 2% for the year and increased 7% to $299 million for the quarter.  In this segment, you most dramatically saw the impact of our cost containment efforts in the first half of the year. In the second half, we stepped up our investments to ensure we have the right resources to successfully implement our customers' clinical solutions. Technology Solutions had total gross R&D spending for the year of $414 million compared to $410 million in the prior year. Of these amounts, we capitalized 16% compared to 17% a year ago. So even in a tough year when we were cutting costs early on, we still felt it was important to invest in the business and sustain our levels of R&D spending. For the year, Technology Solutions' operating profit increased 15% to $385 million, and our operating margin rate was 12.32% compared to 10.9% in the prior year. This is the fourth consecutive year we're making progress towards our long-term operating margin goal of being in the low- to mid-teens and we are pleased with this progress. Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. Our receivables were $8.1 billion, which is up from the March 31, 2009 balance of $7.8 billion. Our days sales outstanding increased by one day versus the prior year to 25 days. Our inventories were $9.4 billion on March 31, an increase of 11% over the prior year. And similarly, our payables increased 13% to $13.3 billion from a year ago.  Both of these increases stem partly from the timing of some year end purchases, and you see this in our days sales and inventory of 34, which was up three days in the prior year on our days sales and payables of 48, which was up from 43 days last year. But beyond the year end timing impacts, we also did a great job this year of focusing the entire management team on cash generation in light of the difficult economic environment we confronted as we enter the year. This focus drove our cash flow from operations up to $2.3 billion, well above our original guidance. This is a great result. Going forward, we have assumed that many of the gains we made in fiscal 2010 were one-time in nature. So you see that we expect our cash flow from operations to be back to a more typical amount of approximately $1.5 billion for fiscal 2011. This strong cash generation allowed us to end the year with a cash balance of $3.7 billion. The strength of our balance sheet and our consistent track record of cash flow generation led two rating agencies in the past year to raise our long-term debt rating to A- levels. All of this positions us well for the continued use of our portfolio referred to capital deployment. Our total capital spending was $378 million for the year, in line with our original guidance of $350 million to $400 million. As we look forward to fiscal 2011, our annual guidance range for capital expenditures is slightly higher than $400 million to $450 million, driven by increased investment in our Distribution network. Let me now close by providing some additional context around our fiscal 2011 earnings guidance of $4.72 to $4.92 per diluted share. In our press release today, you will find a list of the key assumptions underlying this guidance, so I won't go over these again here. I do want to take a minute, however, to provide some additional context for these assumptions. I mentioned earlier that our normalized fiscal 2010 operating margin in Distribution Solutions was 172 basis points. We expect improvement to this normalized operating margin in the high-single-digit basis points. I would point out that our guidance for fiscal 2011 assumes that our flu-related profits will return to the levels we typically experienced in the normal year. In Technology Solutions, we would expect our operating margin rate to show some modest improvement. This improvement, however, will be heavily weighted towards the back half of the fiscal year. In terms of quarters, we do not provide quarterly EPS guidance, due to the variability and the timing of certain items in our businesses. However, at this moment, we can directionally estimate that the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 will be our strongest.  In addition, I would also remind you that in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, as I said at the time, many things went right. Our cost control measures had better-than-expected results, compensation from branded manufacturers was trending well and we had excellent growth in generics despite the customer losses we had experienced entering fiscal 2010. This year, in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we do expect a sizable antitrust settlement that will generate a positive gain of approximately $51 million. Even with this antitrust settlement, however, we would expect to be flat to down modestly year-over-year for the first quarter. In summary, our fourth quarter results were a solid end to what we believe was a great year in fiscal 2010, considering the challenges we faced entering the year. These 2010 results have built a solid foundation for us as we head into fiscal 2011. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first is Tom Gallucci, Lazard Capital Markets.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: First, Jeff, just following on some comments there at the end. A $51 million gain, rough math, I guess real quick, that's $0.10 or $0.12 or so, just want to be sure that's included in the guidance. And then the second thing was just on generics. How you sort of thinking about the year-over-year contribution in fiscal '11 versus fiscal '10 on generics in terms of new ones plus increased penetration in existing accounts.?
Jeff Campbell: So Tom, the answer on a $51 million gain is that, that is included in the guidance. And the answer on generics, as John and I both talked about, is we are expecting strong growth in the profit contribution from generics, and this is driven by a combination of the fact that we see a launch calendar that is probably a little bit better than what we saw in fiscal year '10, though not quite as strong as fiscal year '09. And we expect to have continued growth in the penetration of our generic programs.
Operator: We'll take our next question today from Lisa Gill, JPMorgan.
Lisa Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co: John, you talked about capital deployment and I know that the strategy has stayed fairly consistent. But now you're sitting on $3.7 billion of cash and I appreciate that you're going to buy back some shares, but can you maybe just give us an idea of some of the things you see out there around acquisitions and the kind of size that you're looking at? I mean, is there a specific range state that you're thinking about as far as companies that would fit within McKesson?
John Hammergren: We plan to continue as you note to deploy our capital in a portfolio approach, which will include continued use of dividends. Obviously, the share repurchase that we've expanded today from an authorization perspective gives us over $1.5 billion worth of firepower on that strategy. And we do see a continued acquisition opportunities albeit difficult to forecast and difficult to discuss on a call like this. I don't think we feel like we're particularly constrained from a size perspective. Our constraints are really driven by three factors: first is, sort of the financial model of any potential acquisition. In your term, what does it mean long term, and what is the price of the target? Is it something that makes sense economically for us to pursue? The second and no less important, clearly, is the strategy value that the company might deliver to us over the long haul. And the third, also important is the amount of synergy that exists between our business and the acquired company business. And so I think given McKesson's footprint, we see opportunities really across the healthcare universe that are open for our evaluation. Thus far, obviously, because we've not announced any acquisitions recently, those targets that we've been evaluating amidst on one or of those parameters, or simply can't be executed in a way that makes sense for our shareholders. So I think that we continue to be optimistic that there's a way for us to continue our track record of building value and we plan to continue to keep our options open.
Lisa Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Just as a follow-up, I mean, is it primarily price at this point? So are you seeing good acquisition targets in the marketplace and you just can't come to an agreement on price? Or is it more of a longer-term strategy and you're not quite sure that, that fits in with where you see McKesson going? I just want to get an understanding if how we should be thinking about those.
John Hammergren: Well price clearly plays a very important role on public companies. You guys can run the math and realize what kind of synergies we have to have to make these acquisitions make sense. Arguably, we might be trading that at a multiple that is somewhat depressed compared to historical rates, but also, you'll see certain segments we compete in that, not the least of which is our Technology segment, where multiples might be at a record high. And so we may see those multiples contract over time, and those opportunities then would become more appropriate for us over time. So I think the best way to think about how we evaluate capital deployment is we're patient and the patience ultimately will pay off in good execution for our shareholders. Our patience has limits and clearly the share repurchase authorization that we have announced today shows that we clearly see share repurchase of McKesson's stock as a very competitive alternative to the other strategies we might be evaluating.
Lisa Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Just as a follow-up to the share repurchase, Jeff, are we assuming that you buy throughout the year, or are we assuming that you're going to do something a little bit more aggressive?
Jeff Campbell: Well, as you know, Lisa, we never specifically comment on plans. However, you'll note that one of our key guidance assumptions is that we'll end the year with 267 million shares. So obviously, there's a number of ways you can get there depending on when and how much we buy. But our plan is to get to that number.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Glen Santangelo, Crédit Suisse.
Glen Santangelo - Crédit Suisse First Boston, Inc.: Just a follow-up on Tom's question regarding the guidance. Jeff, if I hear you correctly, it sounds like of the $2.72 to $2.92 range, if we kind of backed out at $0.10 to $0.12 from this kind of one-time gain, you're kind of looking at in apples-to-apples number of around $4.70. And I think in last quarter's conference call, you kind of told us excluding all the one-time items, the base fiscal '10 number was somewhere around $3.95 to $4.10. So can you give us a sense for kind of where that number ended up? And according to our math, it kind of looks like you're forecasting the midpoint of the range to be up about 13%. Is that all fair?
Jeff Campbell: Well, the short answer is, yes, I think you got everything right. Just for everyone's benefit, to remind you, the two items we talked about last time that were big, positives in FY '10, with a $0.35 to $0.40 of the flu. And I point out here that we told you today, we came in right in the middle of that range, and also said that in FY '11, our guidance assumes to the sense all that goes away and that our flu profits return back to levels they were more historically at an FY '09. And prior the other item we pulled out of FY '10 was the ESOP benefit which was $0.14 or $0.15. So other than that, I agree with all of your math.
Glen Santangelo - Crédit Suisse First Boston, Inc.: And Jeff, if I could just ask one follow-up on SG&A, it kind of look like it ticked back up $75 million sequentially from fiscal 3Q. And I know, John, you guys had talked about some certain investments that were maybe made. Could you elaborate on that a little bit, because that kind of looks like a pretty big increase on a quarterly basis.
John Hammergren: Well, we were and we have been and continue to invest heavily in our Technology business, where we believe it's important for us to continue to get in front of what we anticipate to be our customer's expectations from a deployment perspective. I think our view probably early in the third quarters, we started to ramp up those investments has come to pass, and that our customers, through the bookings increase we saw in the fourth quarter are, in fact, making purchasing decisions and would like us to help them deploy these products in time for their meaningful use requirements. So I think, as I mentioned, our investment will continue relatively strong in the first two quarters of next year, and that's in advance, so the revenue really being recognized as it take some time to get these products implemented and signed off on. So I do think that that's certainly one of the year-over-year increases from the spend perspective. I think a lot of the rest is sort of miscellaneous in various areas.
Operator: We'll now hear from Larry Marsh, Barclays Capital.
Lawrence Marsh - Barclays Capital: So the antitrust settlement sounds to me at $0.13 in the first quarter and I assume there's no particular offset you're anticipating, given you haven't called it out. And then I guess, Jeff, on the share repurchase, I know there's different ways to get there, but obviously have a big impact if you were front-end loading your share repurchase assumption versus smoothing it out pretty evenly throughout the year, so which is in terms of just big picture view?
Jeff Campbell: Well, so I think I got the $0.12 on the antitrust settlement, but I agree with your math there. On the share repurchase, the reality is, not only do we not particularly provide guidance. We really haven't made nor, I think, should we make final decisions about the pace and exactly how much of it is applied today, right? So what I can tell you there is, we think we'll get 267 million for the year. And one of the reasons we don't provide quarterly guidance is I can't tell you today exactly how much of that's going to impact the first quarter. What I did say, though, is the fourth quarter will clearly be relative to last year's unusually strong first quarter. I would expect our EPS to be flat to even down a little bit in this year's June quarter.
Lawrence Marsh - Barclays Capital: And just remind us, with the $0.37 contribution from flu fiscal 2010, how should we think of a normalized contribution from flu as we think about this year?
John Hammergren: Yes, Larry, it's almost not even worth calling out. If you think about it in the context of how we used to talk about flu, which was not much, now that's where we're headed back to. It plays a nice role in our Medical-Surgical business, but it gets lost in the rest of the corporation. So this really was a highly unusual event for us. And in our guidance, we don't anticipate it to be repeated.
Lawrence Marsh - Barclays Capital: So it's really kind of a less than $0.05 contribution or something in that ballpark, it sounds like. And I guess, John, just additional question on the Generic, you sound particularly bullish on the launch schedule this year. You guys have always done a really good job of driving compliance. I'm assuming there's no particular larger customers you have announced internally, recently, that would help drive that. But along with that, certainly, some of the specialty products and generics were important contributors this year. Are you anticipating another strong year in Specialty Generics in fiscal '11 for you?
John Hammergren: Well, I think, just to put this into context, the Specialty business is important to us. But on the scale of McKesson and in the scale of our Specialty business, compared to the scale of McKesson, and then the generic products within the Specialty business, once again, it doesn't fall on the top-level attention items that it might be for others who have more concentration in this, on a relative-size basis. Having said all of that, the Generic business in Specialty is important to us, and it didn't perform well this year. We executed, I think, extremely well on the generic that came out. It was an at-risk launch, and we do have product left in our system that we will continue to use this year that will bolster our performance in that business. And there's a chance in our third or fourth quarter that there'll be a couple of additional generic launches in that business that, once again, will be important to that business, but it will be less important to the corporation, overall. So I don't think that the expectations we've given to you guys today are highly sensitive to generic launches within the Specialty business. They are highly sensitive to our view on generics at the corporate level, overall. And therefore, we continue to focus heavily on making sure that all of our businesses are getting generic customers, that we're advancing our compliance to our generic expectations. And now we have this nice pipeline of generics that are coming into both segments that will help us.
Operator: And Garen Safarian (sic) [Garen Sarafian] of Citi is up next.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc: My question is on the Pharma side. Given your two largest distribution clients renewed in the last 12 months or so, I believe, will the rest of your Pharma, become more normal renewal year of about 1/3 of the contracts renewing? And if so, will your sales force be able to -- what opportunities will your sales force now have with the less-than-normal renewal year?
John Hammergren: Well, I think almost all of our years are sort of in that 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 category. We happen to have some concentration this year with a couple of larger customers. As to the deployment of our sales force, I think our sales force are heavily focused at the retail chain level in building long-term value with these customers, and selling parts of our portfolio that help add value to our customers' experience with us. It could be our transaction-processing activity at RelayHealth. It could be pharmacy automation equipment. As you know, we sold Safeway our software to run their retail pharmacies. So there are various things we can do to improve our customers' performance, reduce our own costs and sell the value of a large partnership that go beyond the every two- or three-year contract renewal phase. And so I'm hopeful that, that's what those folks will do. Clearly, there are opportunities, sometimes, for us to call on customers that aren't doing business with McKesson to talk about our value. But there's not a lot of changes that go on at the large retail level. And so we focus heavily on selling additional services to our existing customers and improving our performance, and taking cost out for both of us.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc: And just as a follow-up, specific to CDC, is there any sort of an opportunity for next year to be any sort of a larger scale H1N1 type of a program? And what timeline would you expect that to occur, if so?
John Hammergren: Well, we usually don't talk about our customers and their expectations. I think, given the publicity around this one, clearly, your guess would be as good as mine, as to whether or not another virus comes up or a mutation of the existing virus comes up, and whether the CDC and the administration decide to perform a national approach to this. If that's the case, then I do think we stand in a good position to help in that endeavor. As I mentioned in my comments, the only thing we know for sure is we're going to help them sort of do the final phase through July. It's a real nominal role. And we've kind of decommissioned most of our capabilities here. The positive news is that we can recommission our capabilities very quickly, should the White House call and ask us to perform that responsibility. So we are happy to engage, but at this point, have no view and haven't built nothing in to our financial guidance, relative to a go-forward or second sign of H1N1 kind of a program.
Operator: And next up, we'll hear from Steven Valiquette, UBS.
Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank: Just I guess, kind of similar question to a few other ones, but I guess, based on the share guidance for fiscal '11, I guess, one could arguably assume that only about maybe 1/3 of the full $1.5 billion authorization is actually being used. So just using some back of the envelope here when there could be an extra $0.30 in incremental EPS if the full authorization were to be used. I guess the question is whether the cash possibly used for additional buybacks near term or for M&A, I just want to make sure that you agree that there's some additional earnings power at McKesson. And it looks like it's up pretty material amount that's really not baked into the initial guidance. Is that kind of the safe way to kind of summarize what's going on, and they way you view it as well?
Jeff Campbell: Well, let me make two comments, Steven. Certainly, we see the strength of our balance sheet and our financial flexibility, as they vary material sources of value for our shareholders in the long term, and plan to continue with our portfolio approach to capital deployment. I do think that to get to the share count that we've given, you need to chew not quite a bit more than a third of the current share repurchase authorization of $1.5 billion. You need to remember that there is some level of option exercises that were always experienced in each year. And of course, we do have equity-based compensation programs, and there are some new contingent shares issued as part of those programs each year. So in fact, as earlier commentators or earlier questionners asked about, depending on the pace at which we do this, we will potentially use a very good chunk of the existing authorization to get to that share count assumption. But I think it's important to note, that still leaves us with an under-levered balance sheet, relative to our targets, and probably still with a cash balance that's a little bit above our target.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: A couple of follow-up questions, starting with the buybacks, just approaching it from a different angle. Jeff, can you just provide us, what was the share count at the end of the quarter? And have you bought back any shares quarter-to-date?
Jeff Campbell: Well, so the really relevant number, Ricky, I'd point you to is the number for the March quarter because, of course, our share count is a function, not just of the shares outstanding, but also of what happens with various contingent shares and stock prices, et cetera. Certainly, we have not bought back any shares since the end of the quarter because we've been in our quiet period. And we've been, as you would expect, even if we had wanted to be in the marketplace, we couldn't be buying back any shares. So really, we haven't bought back any shares since the first half of fiscal 2010. When you see our 10-K, which will be filed in the next day or two, of course, it will have a very thorough footnote with every possible number you could think of, related to our share count and other forms of equity-based compensation.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: But given that you haven't bought anything in the second half of fiscal year, it should be pretty similar to what you have.
Jeff Campbell: Correct .
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: And then just to reconfirm what I heard you saying that with the $0.12 benefit of the antitrust that'll mean that you're going to be flat to slightly being down year-over-year or sequentially?
Jeff Campbell: Year-over-year versus last year's very strong first quarter.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: So I know that you don't like to talk about quarters, but if you can just help us with what could be -- when I think about sequentially, what would be the sequential kind of like moving parts in it, aside for brand drug price inflation, which I realize has significant contribution in the March quarter?
Jeff Campbell: Well, remember, our March quarter has been, for years, our strongest quarter in both segments was in fiscal '10. And we'd expect the same thing in fiscal '11. So when you sequentially go from the March quarter to the June quarter, you always see a very significant decline in distribution. It's because mostly, if an accident of history, many of our compensation agreement still have the largest slug of compensation tied to what used to be January price increases, even if the price increases are not relevant anymore. And of course, in technology, at the end of the year, our sales force is sprinting for the finish line and always completes a lot of sale in the March quarter.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: So we just should assume normal seasonality, not necessarily offset by this settlement?
Jeff Campbell: Correct.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley: And is this settlement -- does it flow through the distribution margin? And is the high single-digit basis point improvement that you talked about earlier includes that?
Jeff Campbell: Yes.
Operator: We'll now go to Helene Wolk, Sanford Bernstein.
Helene Wolk - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: Well, I have a couple of questions on the Technology Solutions business. If I understood the guidance for fiscal '11, you were guiding to improvement in the operating margin. I'm just curious on the gross margin basis, if you can add any commentary around mixed shift and the mix of software in the business in '11 versus '10.
John Hammergren: Well, I think the most material thing here is we would expect to have revenue in the back half of the year that we don't really have in the first half. And some of that revenue is going to come in the form of software, which carries a higher margin. You also will notice, in the quarter that we just reported, that hardware revenues were actually down slightly. And I guess, we will see hardware play a less and less significant role in our business, as we go forward, as it relates to the mix of the business that we sell. So some of that margin mix will come from mix change, some of that will, frankly, just come from the execution of contracts that we have to implement, which is also, I guess, a mix change in the end.
Helene Wolk - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: And just any commentary or updates on the meaningful use criteria or certification process that is impactful?
John Hammergren: Well, our customers are clearly very focused on this. And one of the challenges to realizing success for our business in Technology is helping our customers be successful using our technology, which requires both of us to be in the game, getting it done. And so I think that one of our dependencies here is making sure that we've invested for these implementations, that our customers are ready and they've also invested. And clearly, the pressure from Washington to get to these milestone dates is important, albeit there are some parts of our customer base that are trying to lobby Congress to stretch those time frames out. That gives us the benefit of having more time to make the implementations go live, but obviously, the detriment side of that is it reduces the rush to get it done as well. So it's kind of a mixed blessing. But there is a debate, obviously, if you follow technology going on in Washington, about whether these objectives are too difficult for our customers to reach.
Helene Wolk - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: Has there been any temporary certification process completed?
John Hammergren: Well, not to my knowledge. I know that, as you might recall, there were certification of some of the physician office products in the past that have gone through these activities. But the certification process in Washington, as far as I know, is not even yet been fully armed, or staffed or ready to go. So I think they are still in the process of getting that up to speed.
Operator: Eric Coldwell of Robert W. Baird is up next.
Eric Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: First off, antitrust settlements. I don't recall any of those back in fiscal '10, but could you tell us if there were any?
Jeff Campbell: You're correct. There were none. It's been a couple of years since we've had any, Eric.
Eric Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: So not an unusual event, just didn't have any last year. And second question is, from your prepared remarks, it sounded like you comment that a couple of your larger clients reduced purchases in the March quarter. I wasn't sure that I was clear on the reasoning behind that, and then what would make you comfortable that perhaps fiscal '11 will grow at market rates? Why are those slower customers coming back, if you will?
John Hammergren: Well, the reality is, as I mentioned, we've not lost any customers and nor, really, have we lost any percentage of our large customers' business. What's happened that we experienced over the last 12 months is two of our larger customers launched a share on their own. And when they grow less than the market, it's difficult for us to grow at market or above market when a large portion of our base businesses with the existing customers that are losing share at the retail or the mail level. So obviously, that momentum ebbs and flows, and to the extent that our customers when we win -- and to the extent our customers don't win, we don't win. And so I think that, that's what we were referring to there. That it was not a share loss or a customer moving away from us.
Jeff Campbell: And Eric, just to correct something I said. Actually, I guess, I didn't even realize, but a colleague here have told me, we did have about $0.01 worth of a positive antitrust settlement in FY '10.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Richard Close, Jefferies & Company.
Richard Close - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: With respect to the, I think, the operating margin, you talk about mid- to high single digits in fiscal '11. Just to be clear, that's not including the benefit of the flu from fiscal '10, correct?
Jeff Campbell: Correct, Richard. So I pointed out in my remarks that if you take two things out of the FY '10 Distribution Solutions margin, the $0.35 to $0.40 to the flu, and then the Distribution Solutions portion of the ESOP or 401(k) plan benefits, the FY '10 margin was 172 basis points. Of that 172 is what I was referring to.
Richard Close - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: And then with respect to -- John, I think you mentioned Health Mart adding about 500 stores in the fiscal '10 year. Were those conversions from maybe other companies? Or were those just sole independents coming over to Health Mart? Just trying to see what you think about market share there. And then any expectations, I guess, for that number in the upcoming fiscal year?
John Hammergren: Well, because we probably have some sales execs listening to this phone call, our expectations are always to grow our store counts. So I'll send them a clear message. Health Mart continues to be a very important priority for us, and we do expect it to continue to grow. The mix of the 500 stores that came on were probably across the board. Some were customers that were existing McKesson customers that converted to the Health Mart franchise, some were new customers to McKesson who chose to become Health Mart right out of the gate and some were existing Health Mart customers that opened a new store or a new branch. So it's really across the board, and we'd hope to continue to grow the program.
Operator: And our final question today comes from Robert Jones, Goldman Sachs.
Robert Jones - UBS: Just one quick follow-up on Eric's question about the two large customers that have lower purchasing in 4Q. What's the assumption for those customers in fiscal 2011?
John Hammergren: Well, I think it's difficult to talk about specific customers. We believe that we will be able to grow at market rates, but we always talk about our mix of customers. And the ebbs and flows of market share for very large customers, particularly with people like mail customers, you should assume are our lowest profit margin customers as well. So although the revenue was impacted this year, as a result of some of that reduced buying, we actually saw the strength in our gross profits. So there's two reasons we'd point to the gross profits strength: one, is that, that's really how we have to run the company; but secondly, it's also an indicator of the strength of our generics programs and our ability to build margin that isn't affected by the downward pressure on revenues that occurs, as a result of the generic conversions that go on in our industry. So although we see revenue growth rates in the industry continuing in that low single-digit range, we hope the gross profit will grow faster. And that will be a sign of the health of the distribution community, it's if we can grow our gross profits faster than our revenues.  I want to thank you, operator, and thank all of you on the call today for your time. We had excellent results in fiscal 2010. We remain very excited about our unique offering across healthcare and our ability to turn that into value for our customers and our shareholders. I'll now hand the call back to Ana for her review of upcoming events for the financial community. Ana?
Ana Schrank: Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events. We will participate in the Deutsche Bank Healthcare Conference in Boston tomorrow, the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Healthcare Conference in New York on May 11, the UBS Healthcare Supply Chain Conference in New York on May 20 and the City Healthcare Conference in New York on May 27. We will release first quarter earnings results in late July. We look forward to seeing you at one of these upcoming events. Thank you and goodbye.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. We would like to thank you all for your participation.

Operator: Welcome to McKesson Corporation’s fiscal 2010 third quarter conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce Miss Anna Schrenk – Vice President Investor Relations.
Anna Schrenk: Good afternoon and welcome to the McKesson fiscal 2010 third quarter earnings call. With me today are John Hammergren, McKesson’s Chairman and CEO and Jeff Campbell, our CFO. John will first provide a business update and will then introduce Jeff who will review the financial results for the quarter. After Jeff’s comments we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 6:00 pm ET. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results. In addition to the company’s periodic and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Thanks, and here’s John Hammergren.
John Hammergren: Thanks Anna and thanks everyone for joining us on our call. I’m pleased with the solid execution and continued momentum in our business. For the third quarter we achieved total company revenues of $28.3 billion and net income of $326 million or $1.19 per diluted share. Considering the challenges we faced coming into the year, we have performed better than we had anticipated and I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished so far. Some of our excess was one time in nature such as the benefit from the Securities Litigation settlement proceeds distributed to our 401K plan. But our strong performance also stems from operational excellence, diligent cost management and being ideally situated to benefit from opportunities such as the increased demand related to this year’s flu season. Let me take a moment to talk about the flu season now since it impacts several different areas of the company. In the third quarter we experienced a positive impact from higher demand for flu related products across several of our businesses. Certainly the single largest contribution has come from our expanded relationship with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to handle the centralized delivery of the H1N1 flu vaccine and ancillary medical supplies. On our last conference call in October, there was some uncertainty because it was difficult to predict how many doses of the vaccine would ultimately be delivered and because we had not finalized the necessary modifications to our existing agreement with the CDC to encompass this program. Since then we finalized the agreement and have managed well in excess of 100 million of the vaccine and ancillary supplies and have done so in a safe and efficient manner. In addition to delivery of the vaccine, we experienced increased demand for flu related medications that are distributed through our U.S. pharmaceutical business; food test kits and other supplies that are shipped through Medical Surgical and calls to our Nurse Hotline that are part of our Health Solutions business. Typically, flu related demand is relatively stable from year to year. This year, we had a significant increase in demand due to the H1N1 virus and it was heavily weighted to the December quarter. Moving on to some specifics for the third quarter, Distribution Solutions performed well with solid contributions from all of our businesses. Revenue growth of 4% was in line with our expectations given the continued impact from the loss of two customer buying groups in U.S. pharmaceutical in late fiscal 2009. These customer losses will impact us for the remainder of our fiscal year. The other dynamic in U.S. pharmaceutical is that our sell side margin is down as a result of events that we experienced the last fiscal year. Consistent with comments that we made in the fourth quarter last year, it will take us a full year to lap the impact. Our Generics programs continue to lead the market. While one stop sales are still impacted by last year’s loss of an independent buying group customer, the team was able to grow Generic gross profit in the quarter with continued focus on better compliance within our existing customer base. Included in our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution and services results are the results of our Specialty Care Solutions business. This business is performing well, benefiting from both its long standing relationship with the CDC and the launch of a generic last quarter. Turning to our businesses in Distribution Solutions, our Medical Surgical business had a solid contribution to the overall success of Distribution Solutions. Medical Surgical’s revenues grew significantly reflecting increased demand related to flu and aided by acquisitions made in late fiscal 2009. Aside from the strength of the flu, the business has demonstrated solid execution. I’m pleased with our progress in Medical Surgical, particularly the continued focus on expense control measures and global sourcing of McKesson branded products. Lastly, we had a very strong performance in our Canadian distribution business with revenues on a constant currency basis up 8%. During the quarter we sold our 50% equity interest in McKesson Logistic Solutions. We had started this third party logistics business organically in 1994 and merged it with a company named ALS in 2004 to form a 50/50 joint venture which grew to 55 manufacturing customers by the time it was sold. Although successful, it was not core to our Canadian distribution business so we took the opportunity to monetize our investment when we were able to ensure the realization of a nice profit. We remain excited about our business in Canada. Many of our programs and solutions that are available to our U.S. pharmaceutical customers are also available in Canada which clearly differentiates the value of our offering. While we’re best known as a leader in pharmaceutical distribution, McKesson Canada does more than order fulfillment and logistics. We’ve automated 2500 retail pharmacies and every year over 100 million doses are dispensed through McKesson’s hospital automation solutions. The strength of our distribution customer relationships has provided a great platform for the growth of our technology footprint in Canada. Recently we signed a contract with the Province of Quebec to install our PAX technology in 43 hospitals and we are connecting a network of 95 sites that will be sharing medical images. In addition, our PAX business has secured contracts for the largest clinical organization in the country, Canadian Medical Laboratories, serving 120 ambulatory radiology clinics across Canada with additional interest in U.S. clinics. I’m extremely pleased with our year to date performance in Distribution Solutions. We have achieved strong results despite the challenges we faced coming into the year and we expect our momentum to continue. Turning now to Technology Solutions, in the third quarter our performance was steady with top line growth driven by services revenues. Over time we’ve built a stable business with stable business models throughout the Technology Solutions segment. Much of our revenue comes from predictable recurring streams. We believe the steady nature and complete solution set of out technology businesses fit well within the larger McKesson offering. The stimulus package created the incentive for health care providers to improve care by implementing clinical technology solutions such as the electronic health record. Last month, the Federal Government released proposed and interim final rules that health care providers and vendors will need to meet under the High Tech Act portion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. We’ve working closely with OMC’s Federal Advisory Committees both the HIT Policy Committee and the HIT Standards Committee over the past eight months so there really were no surprises for us in the receipt of the proposed rules. The proposed criteria for meaningful use and certification both of which are necessary requirements to quality for stimulus monies are generally comparable with the objective previously published as recommended by the Committees and our electronic health records systems for hospitals and physicians are well positioned to meet these objectives. The official certification process has not been fully delineated so no technology company has had their products certified, but we are on track to submit our EHR products for initial certification as soon as we have a clear indication of the process. We are eager to see the process finalized so that we can continue to move our customers through the deployment process. We’ve just announced a strategic partnership with HP to accelerate electronic health record adoption at independent physician practices across the country. McKesson and HP will offer physicians McKesson’s EGR practice management systems bundled with HP office hardware and preconfigured for easy installation. The two companies are working together toward the common goal of simplifying physician EHR adoption so physicians can meet the stimulus deadlines. We expect our technology business will benefit from the clinical wave that has been created by the stimulus and we can also provide the connectivity features that allow rapid movement of clinical and financial information through the entire network of health care. Not only are we helping customers serve their near term clinical requirements, we will have ongoing opportunities when hospitals turn to us to help them re-architect their financial systems to provide improved cash flow and connectivity and improve relationships with patients. We’ll be able to accomplish this with solutions such as Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management which is the complete reinvention of the financial tools that hospitals use to manage the financial and administrative side of the enterprise combined with the technology necessary to connect with payers and patients. We mentioned this last quarter but it’s important to emphasis that Horizon ERM was designed with an architecture similar to our clinical systems and therefore the integration and inner workings of these two solutions are compatible, and the system incorporates other McKesson software solutions such as clinical content and relay health connectivity tools. None of our competitors has an offering that services the entire health care system the way that McKesson does. Our ability to understand the interactions that take place in this fragmented health care system and creates solutions from that knowledge benefits our customers and provides opportunity for us. Increasingly, our connectivity solutions through relay health and our solutions for the payer market through our health solutions business are becoming larger components of technology solutions.  In McKesson Health Solutions, our footprint is unparalled and we uniquely combine expert technology with evidence based clinical information to enable payers to manage their administrative and medical costs. In our Relay Health business we facilitate the exchange of information among almost every player in the health care system including health systems, pharmacies, payers, physicians, government agencies and consumers. We have expanded our health information exchange footprint with strategic wins at health systems that are choosing Relay Health to exchange health information among various constituents. With more than one million patients involved in our system, McKesson is the only major player that has the patient actively participating in HIE connectivity. Relay Health is playing a significant role in helping customers achieve meaningful use by supporting inter-operateability and data exchange requirements for hospitals and physician practices using both McKesson and non McKesson solutions. I’m pleased with the work that has been done by the team to help our customers identify the information technology they need to design adoption roadmaps to help them reach their objectives for meaningful use. Year to date our Technology Solutions results are tracking with what we expected as we entered the year with steady revenue growth and solid operating margin expansion. Our customers are buying and installing clinical solutions and we are ramping up our business to match the momentum created by the stimulus. Our intention is to invest more heavily in the back half of this fiscal year because we are committed to successful implementing our customer’s clinical solutions, but we are also building the business for the next decade which is why our offering includes the latest financial solutions for hospitals that I discussed previously as well as the connectivity that will be necessary to exchange information throughout the network. Now before I turn it over to Jeff I want to leave you with a few more general thoughts. This really is a very fortunate time to be in health care, and I believe McKesson is perfectly positioned.  Everything we see in our future is generally supportive of continued growth in our businesses. We are ideally situated in an environment where the use of pharmaceuticals are doing nothing but expand given the aging population and the evidence and proof that pharmaceuticals are the lowest cost alternative from a health care perspective. Our diversified technology platform is at the center of much of what is going on in health care today; the current clinical wave, the growing focus on connectivity and the enterprise wide financial systems that will be required to pull it all together. All of our businesses are producing sound operating results with very positive cash flow. We have demonstrated our ability to deploy cash with a portfolio approach that over time has created significant value for our shareholders. Over the past seven fiscal years we’ve deployed more than $4 billion for 33 acquisitions which have paid off with strategic value for the company and good financial results. Over that same time period we’ve deployed more than $4 billion to repurchase 83 million shares and doubled our dividend. You might find us building cash at times but I would remind you that our capital deployment is balance when you view it over years as opposed to quarters. We do not manage decisions around share repurchases, acquisitions and the dividend on a quarter to quarter basis. Instead, we are patient and take a longer term view with the intent of consistently exceeding our shareholders expectations toward the use of our cash flow. In summary, I’m confident in the earnings potential of the company and pleased that we are raising our full year guidance and now expect earnings per diluted share of $4.55 to $4.70 for fiscal 2010 excluding the favorable second quarter litigation credit. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Jeff and return to address your questions when he finishes.
Jeff Campbell: Thanks John and good afternoon everyone. As you’ve just heard, McKesson is built upon the momentum achieved in the first half of our fiscal year to deliver solid third quarter results. Before I begin reviewing our financial performance, let me point out that my discussion will exclude for comparison purposes the impact of the prior year’s third quarter AWUP litigation charge. As usual, I’ll begin by discussing our consolidated results then I’ll provide additional color when I discuss each segment in more detail and I’ll close with an update on our full year outlook. Revenues for the quarter were $28.3 billion representing 4% growth. Gross profit for the quarter increased 8% to $1.5 billion. This leverage at the gross profit line is driven by Distribution Solutions. Total operating expenses for the quarter increased 5% to $946 million due to higher employee compensation costs, foreign exchange rate movements and higher legal expenses and legal settlement charges. While we continue to see some benefit from the cost containment initiatives we put in place beginning mid fiscal 2009, we have begun to lap these efforts. Operating income for the quarter grew 16% to $509 million. Moving below operating income, other income was $25 million compared to $17 million in the prior year. As discussed in our October earnings call, the current year benefited from the sale of our equity interest in McKesson Logistic Solutions which resulted in a pre tax gain of $17 million or approximately $0.05 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of this sale, the decline in other income was primarily due to lower interest income resulting from lower prevailing interest rates.  Interest expense for the quarter of $47 million increased due to the $700 million in debt we issued last February. Moving to taxes, our full year run rate remains at the 32% we have been using all year. Our third quarter effective tax rate of 33.1% includes a $0.03 impact from unfavorable tax discrete items. This compares to 31.2% in the prior year as the prior year included $0.03 of favorable tax discrete items. Net income was $326 million and diluted earnings per share was $1.19. To wrap up our consolidated results, this year’s EPS number was aided by the cumulative impact of our share repurchases which lowered our diluted weighted average shares outstanding by 1% year over year to 274 million shares. Let’s now move on to Distribution Solutions results. In this segment we are pleased with overall revenue growth of 4% compared to the same quarter last year. Total U.S. pharmaceutical distribution and services revenue increased 2% primarily reflecting market growth, partially offset by the fiscal 2009 customer losses that we previously discussed. As you’ve seen for several quarters now we continue to show a shift from warehouse purchases to direct store delivery by a large customer. This was substantially completed this quarter. Canadian revenues on a constant currency basis grew 8% for the quarter primarily due to market growth. Including a favorable currency impact of 15% Canadian revenues grew 23% for the quarter. Medical Surgical Distribution revenues were up 11% for the quarter to $758 million.  Gross profit for the segment grew 12% to $1.1 billion up from $1 billion a year ago. The increased demand related to the flu season which I’ll come back to in a few minutes and to a lesser extent increased margins from the sale of generic drugs helped drive an improved mix of higher margin products across our distribution businesses. These events drove a significantly expanded gross profit margin rate. Partially offsetting these benefits, our sell margin was negatively impacted by customer renewals and the loss of customers that occurred late in our fiscal 2009 as well as lower compensation from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers due to timing.  Our Distribution Solutions operating expenses increased to 2% for the quarter to $568 million which is below the 4% increase in revenues, highlighting our continued ability to achieve expense leverage in this business. Operating profit for the quarter was $558 million compared to $439 million in the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, the current year benefited from the sale of our equity interest in McKesson Logistics Solutions. In summary, and before I move on to Technology Solutions, we’re very pleased with all the efforts of our Distribution Solutions team to mitigate the challenges we faced at the beginning of this fiscal year. In Technology Solutions, total revenues grew 3% for the quarter to $771 million. This brings year to date growth for Technology Solutions to 2% which is roughly in line with our full year assumption to remain at levels similar to fiscal 2009. Services revenues increased 6% in the quarter to $610 million reflecting the more stable nature of these service revenues. Assistance revenues of $138 million declined 2% from the prior year. Hardware revenues of $23 million in the quarter were down 32% from the prior year, reflecting lower rates at which hardware is attached as part of system implementations and overall reduced hardware component costs. Technology Solutions gross profit declined by 1% to $351 million driven primarily by a higher software deferral rate, an additional amortization in costs related to Horizon enterprise revenue management. When Horizon generally became available in the second quarter it triggered incremental amortization expense of $75 million for the quarter. Technology Solutions operation expenses increased 2% in the quarter to $271 million. These higher expenses are primarily due to the increased R&D spending and a weaker U.S. dollar compared to the prior year. We continue to innovate and invest in R&D to maintain our leadership position. For the quarter Technology Solutions had total R&D spending of $104 million compared to $99 million in the prior year. Of these amounts, we capitalized just 14% compared to 19% a year ago. Our operating profit in our Technology Solutions segment this quarter was $81 million, down 11% from the $91 million we recorded a year ago. Our operating margin in this segment was 10.51% for the quarter compared to 12.12% in the prior year. We’ll leave our segment performance now and turn briefly to the balance sheet and our working capital metrics. Our receivables were $8.3 billion which is up from the December 21, 2008 balance of $7.6 billion. Our day sales outstanding remain flat at 23 days after adjusting the prior year for the $350 million utilization of our AR sales facility. Moving on to inventories, through continued careful inventory management, and as a result of timing our 30 days sales in inventory again showed a nice improvement of three days compared to last year. Our inventories were $8.8 billion on December 31, a 6% decrease over the prior year. For the second quarter in a row we have showed a modest sequential improvement for DSI from what we posted at the end of the previous quarters. Our payables increased 6% to $13 billion from a year ago and day’s sales in payables increased to 44 days from 43 days last year. These working capital improvements have resulted in $1.7 billion in operating cash flow year to date. These results include the impact of the $350 million AWP settlement payment that was released from escrow in our December quarter just ended. Based on our continued progress we feel very comfortable in our ability to generate in the range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion of operating cash for the full year fiscal 2010. This strong cash flow generation has led to a cash balance of $3.4 billion at December 31. As our share repurchase activity has slowed during the year we now expect our full year average share count to come in a bit above the original guidance we provided of 272 million shares outstanding. Our capital spending continues to trend as expected at $350 million to $400 million for the year. Now I’ll turn to our outlook. As John mentioned earlier, we are raising our guidance on diluted EPS excluding the favorable second quarter litigation credit from $4.45 to $4.60 to a new range of $4.55 to $4.70.  As we’ve had a number of updates to our guidance range during the year, I think it’s worthwhile to review some of the key changes impacting our EPS range from the beginning of the fiscal year to now. As a reminder, we started the year providing an EPS range of $3.90 to $4.05. Since then a couple of things have happened. First, we had a favorable legal settlement impacting the company’s 401K plan which drove approximately $0.15 of upside spread fairly evenly throughout the year. Second, we had a $0.05 benefit related the third quarter sales of our 50% stake in the Canadian joint venture, McKesson Logistics Solutions. Third, we’ve seen increased demand from the flu that is incremental to last year’s flu performance. We now expect the incremental demand for this flu season will contribute $0.35 to $0.40 to our full year EPS, a little more than two thirds of which came in our December quarter. Looking to next year on the flu, our goal will be to find business opportunities that allow us to sustain this level of incremental profit but we are unlikely to sustain it all at this year’s level. So, if you were to adjust for these three items the favorable 401K legal settlement, the McKesson Logistics Solutions sale and the incremental flu, you get to an EPS range that is $0.05 to $0.10 above our original guidance for the year. In closing, we are pleased with our ability to rise to the challenges we have faced so far this year and we believe our solid execution to date will propel us to a strong finish in fiscal 2010. Thanks, and with that, I’ll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. I would ask that you limit your questions to just one per person to allow others an opportunity to participate.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Glen Santangelo – Credit Suisse.
Glen Santangelo – Credit Suisse: Just a quick question on the health care IT business; basically in the press release you wrote that the gross margins were a little bit weaker as you’re seeing a higher software deferral rate. Can you just elaborate on that a little bit more? Is that basically just assuming that you’re seeing less demand in this environment or is that actually say something about revenue recognition and maybe these contracts taking longer to implement than you thought?
John Hammergren: I think for the quarter the business probably experienced a little bit more of a change in the mix of the business than we normally would have seen that caused some of this but stepping it up just a level, I would say that our Technology Business has seen that our customers are buying at a rate that is at or above what our expectations were coming into the year. The challenge for us now as we look at the rest of this year and into next year is the implementation time for some of these relationships that have expanded beyond what would have been perhaps a more let’s put this in as we go kind of philosophy to we want a contract for a complete solution to get ready for stimulus. So what we might have normally installed in this quarter and recognized in this quarter from the software perspective and realizing to revenues, is not so much related to what we sell, what we book. It’s what will we recognize as revenue. What we recognize as revenue is both mix related but also time to implementation and complexity related. So I think our tone and tenor of this should be positive albeit somewhat extended as it relates to getting actual P&L results from what our customers are asking us to do.  And you also saw similar related to the software, our comments about margins, are still in line with what we expected but we are investing as we suggested last quarter more heavily in the back half of this year which will continue through our fourth quarter and this is all in the spirit of how do we get these implementations done more quickly for our customers in time for the stimulus. So it’s really a combination of more complex contracts and longer time to implement and then the added burden of expenses in advance of those implementations which you don’t see which are positive trends from the booking perspective.
Glen Santangelo – Credit Suisse: You said more complex contracts, does that mean that some of your clients are basically looking to push payments out as they can hopefully match up stimulus payments with the payments ultimately to the software vendor. Is that what you mean by that or no?
John Hammergren: It’s certainly the characteristics of the contract as much as the complexity of the products they’re trying to buy all at one time so if we sold a simple product and got it installed, we recognize it in revenue and earnings. When we sell that simple product as part of a multi product contract, that revenue will get hung up until we get the entire contract installed. So it’s actually a positive if you think about it in a multi quarter sense. It just might be a negative if you think about it in a short term sense.
Operator: Your next question comes from Charles Boorady – Citi.
Charles Boorady – Citi: My question is going to be on the Rite Aid renewal and congratulations on that. I know you don’t talk about customer specifics but I’m curious on just seasonality of earnings how that might be impacted by this renewal and also take outs generally, were there changes in the nature of the relationship or changes in the contract. I know for some contracts year one takes a step down before rebounding in subsequent years.
John Hammergren: Well we’re obviously like you pleased that we renewed our valued relationship. It’s a long standing relationship and we’ve developed a significant partnership with Rite Aid and it relies on great integration on both sides of the relationship to deliver great value for both of us. I think the way to describe the Rite Aid renewal is that any of these large customers you have to step up and deliver value and you can’t charge more than the value you’re delivering and we’re fortunate to continue to prove to Rite Aid and to others that we’re the partner of choice for these relationships and I think if there had been any material changes to this relationship we would have probably said something specific about it. I think that this falls in line with that sort of annual process that we have or every third year process we have with customers that we go through from a renewal perspective and there’s really nothing abnormal or unusual in this environment.
Charles Boorady – Citi: So no change to the seasonality of the quarterly earnings we should expect related to the renewal?
John Hammergren: No, the seasonality in our earnings are more driven by the way our relationship with manufacturers drives the margin structure in our P&L. So if you actually look at the quarter break down and the margin rates, you’ll see some variability. That seasonality might be a little bit related to the cold and flu season but it’s more related to the behavior of manufacturers relative to price increases and the continued structures structure of our relationships with manufacturers where we receive payment in those kinds of interval. So albeit we try to move our margins up year over year, in our Distribution Solutions segment margin rate increases and we expect to experience that again this year as we guided to at the beginning of the year, we will still see seasonality in our business, and that is a completely different discussion than customer contract renewals. And I don’t thing there’s seasonality in that context of customer renewals. If you lose one by surprise or something negative happens, it just happened and it has nothing to do with how our season and our quarters work.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robert Willoughby – Bank of America.
Robert Willoughby – Bank of America: I guess I look at your portfolio approach to managing capital and hear a comment on creating value but on our numbers Here you’re trading on a discount to the group and the biggest difference would be you’re heavier on acquisition and lighter on dividends. Any thought to revisiting that strategy? What are we basing our enthusiasm for deals on Here?
John Hammergren: I would say that our valuation is probably affected by the fact that we have $3.5 billion or whatever on our balance sheet that hasn’t been deployed in either direction and if you actually go back and look at the history of our acquisitions, I believe we’ve been able to deliver more value to our shareholders through well executed acquisitions than we have in share repurchases or dividends. That’s not to say that we don’t pass on many deals because dividends and share repurchases are a better decision. So our confidence in doing acquisitions is built on the success we’ve had with them. Our confidence on buying shares or paying dividends is the fact that we appreciate that we have a portfolio approach and sometimes the capital is better deployed in that way. I guess the message in this quarter is that we don’t feel necessarily a big rush to deploy the capital and I’m hoping that our shareholders will continue to look at that cash on our balance sheet as a point of value as opposed to a missed opportunity to create value.
Robert Willoughby – Bank of America: I guess it’s a point of value though would I describe a premium on an ability to get it deployed more rapidly and without any loss of efficacy I guess is the question.
John Hammergren: Well clearly it is a drag on our near term results if its not deployed in a way that produces returns that are at or superior to the returns we get on the rest of our capital. So I think we have an awareness of the fact that we are not optimized from a capital structure at this moment, but as Jeff and I mentioned in our prepared comments, we try to look at these things over a longer horizon that just a quarter or two or even a year for that matter. And hopefully, the time that we spend waiting for the right deployment opportunity is made up for by the right deployment ultimately and I think we’ve taken a successful portfolio approach to doing that over the last seven to ten years and we’ll continue to.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ross Mukin – Deutsche Bank.
Ross Mukin – Deutsche Bank: Just a follow up on Bob’s question. It came up this morning as well on one of your peer’s calls. It seems like there’s quite a bit of available assets in both the public and private market given some of the dislocation over the last 24 months in the financial markets. I was sort of thinking about places you’d focus on deploying that capital potentially from an M&A perspective. Can you point to a few areas that consistently places where you are looking to put investments to work?
John Hammergren: I think we’ll continue to use the portfolio approach so I don’t want to have people misinterpret my comments and assume that we’re only going to do acquisitions. But speaking specifically about acquisitions, we think there are opportunities and they appear sometimes not when you want them to but there will be opportunities to deploy against acquisitions in all of our core businesses and we’ve done it in pharmaceutical and medical distribution in the past and in technology. There are clearly times where things get over valued and there are times when assets are not for sale that you have to be patient about, but I think the most important take away from this discussion should be that we’ve built a track record and if we choose to deploy any of our capital in acquisitions I would hope to do so intelligently and in a way that creates more value than a share repurchase would create for us. So I think you’d find that we would look to the businesses that we’re in today and we bring some knowledge. We bring some synergy. It’s unlikely that we will buy companies that our shareholders could buy and we can’t add any value beyond what you could add to them to hold them independently.
Ross Mukin – Deutsche Bank:  That’s far more eloquent than I could have said it. One quick question on the gross margin for Distribution; there’s a lot of moving parts obviously there this quarter. We teased out the different contributors to some of the strong year over year growth and whether we look at it in terms of general compliance going up or at risk launch or new generics, versus some of the headwinds you have from lost business, how do we think about that in terms of the percent components and maybe from a qualitative perspective?
Jeff Campbell: If you’ll bear with me for one second, let me answer starting at the operating margin for Distribution then I’ll come back to the gross margin. Of course we always have quarterly volatility so you know we encourage people to think about the margin on a full basis. But if you look at the operating margin for the December quarter, if you take out the year over year change in the flu profits, the operating profit margin is relatively flat and that’s because of a change this year in the timing of some of our compensation from the branded manufacturers. If you look at the full year though, for our FY10 versus FY ’09 our expectation is if you strip out in both year flu profits you would see a basis of at least a 10 basis point improvement year over year in the operating margin rate for Distribution Solutions. Now to come to your gross margin comment; it gets a little bit more judgmental at the way we adjust at the gross margin level for the flu but you’d see a pretty similar pattern. So for the December quarter your gross margin would be down a little bit but for the full year your gross margin is going to be up and once you strip the flu out, the overwhelming driver of that year over year gross margin improvement are the improved profits on generics. Because of the loss of the retail independents we experienced last year the real driver of the increased profits on generics this year comes from a combination of better compliance, better penetration amongst our existing customer base, better sourcing combined with a pretty good launch schedule this year although I would point out that this year’s launch schedule is not quite as good as last year’s.
Operator: Your next question comes from Lawrence Marsh – Barclays Capital.
Lawrence Marsh – Barclays Capital: If I could just elaborate a little bit I think Jeff one of your comments was reflecting on the incremental contribution from flu. I think you said $0.35 to $0.40 this year and I think that compares to roughly $0.20 you said after the September quarter. I wanted to understand that and also I think you said if you back out all the adjustments for this year you’re $0.05 to $0.10 above your original guidance which I think was $3.90 to $4.05. Could you reconcile that with thinking ahead your goal was to find business opportunities to match the $0.35 to $0.40 contribution from flu but I think you said it would be tough to fully match that so if you would elaborate on that that would be great.
Jeff Campbell: Let me start with what’s changed on our view of the flu now versus 90 days ago and then I’ll talk a little bit about our goal of recreating next year as much as we can of this year’s incremental profits from the flu. 90 days ago when we had our last earnings call, it was still very early on in the flu season and in fact as you recall in our September quarter our profits year over year related to the flu were pretty flat, so we were just entering the period of getting a sense of what kind of incremental demand we were going to see for everything from generic drugs related to the flu to flu test kits in our medical surgical business, the seasonal flu vaccines and then of course at that point had not finalized our contract for the amendment to our existing contract with the CDC and there was tremendous uncertainty I think it’s fair to say 90 days ago about just exactly how the Federal governments efforts to deliver H1N1 vaccines across the country would play out. So 90 days later, we not only finalized that CDC contract but we have a very clear grasp now of likely shipment volumes. We think that we’ve been through the peak of things like demand for flu test kits although I suppose we could be surprised in the next 60 days. So it’s a combination of all those things that has taken us from what was a very rough estimate 90 days ago to today when I think it’s a pretty strong read on the incremental benefit this year from all of those things we do related to the flu versus last year. So that is a long way of answering your question how we got from up to $0.20 which is what we said 90 days ago all the way up to a range of $0.35 to $0.40 now.
John Hammergren: I think as we came into this year we were obviously very focused on what are we going to do with the loss of the $3 billion of revenue at the first day of our new fiscal year and so we put in several majors to try to counteract that and clearly tight expense controls and optimizing our performance with our existing customers and suppliers to improve returns on those pieces of business and basically looking everywhere for opportunities. And clearly we were well positioned I think to take advantage of the opportunity presented with the flu season. We were in very good businesses that participate in flu but we also had a business that had a current tract record of performance with CDC and we were able to build out those six distribution centers in a matter of weeks to service this unprecedented requirement. So clearly I’m pleased with what we did this year to fill the hole. I would hope that as we come back and we start fiscal 11, we don’t have a similar kind of customer hole to dig our way out of as we start the year that will give us the typical momentum that you expect from McKesson year on year. And then secondly, to Jeff’s comments and my comments relative to trying to find additional opportunities to help cover the year on year lap of the flu event, it’s still not clear to us what demands might be on us next year, what kind of flu season we might have. There’s discussion about H1N1 coming back in a more virulent way and clearly I think we’ve demonstrated our ability to help in these emergency needs of the country and hope that the six facilities that we’ve established will not all be turned off and set aside. Clearly anything we can do to work through that with the CDC or others in terms of utilizing those assets will be nothing but upside given that we had anticipated that they would be put out of commission as the season draws to an end. So there would be an opportunity dependant on your view of what might happen in the future for the vaccination perspective and how our vaccine business overall might continue to evolve given our import now to the country relative to things like standard flu and other vaccinations that take place like we started with with the Children’s Health Vaccine program. So I think the point of our discussion is to highlight the fact that the $0.35 to $0.40 we believe is unusual and also highlight the fact that we are working hard to find other opportunities that will help us cover some of that year on year comparison.
Lawrence Marsh – Barclays Capital: But just to be clear, it sounds like you’re saying that vaccine and other relationships with CDC you’d be able to offset some of that $0.35 to $0.40 next fiscal year. You’re saying it may not, you’re obviously tough to fill the entire hole, but you could fill with some confidence a good bit of that with existing relationships around flu apart from the acquisitions and other things?
John Hammergren: I think it’s difficult for us to talk about fiscal 11 on this call given that we’re still working through the numbers and what that might be and we’ve got one quarter left to go. I think the message you should be hearing from us is we executed this relationship with the CDC in a flawless way and we furthered our relationship and our credential on our ability to do this going forward. I can’t speak for the Federal government or the medical community in terms of what desires they might have for this kind of a program. What I can say though is that vaccines are used in many ways in this country and there might be other ways we can assist the distribution of specialty products like vaccines that are highly regulated and need to be refrigerated etc. through this distribution capability. But even if you set all that aside, you should assume that our teams are working as they think about next year not only how do we grow off of the $3.90 to full $0.05 to $0.10 that you were talking about but also what is that number really going to be as we focus on next year. So as we finish the fourth quarter we’ll be prepared to give you better insight but I think what we attempted to do on this call was to quantify at least for everyone what we think the numbers are relative to the H1N1 activity this year and at least put out there one of the challenges we face as you think about next year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gene Mannheimer – Auriga.
Gene Mannheimer – Auriga: My question relates to the tech solutions business in particular. As you worked with HIT policy and other standards committees over the last several months, do you feel that your Clinical Solutions today has the required level of functionality to meet the certification criteria relative to those of your competitors and if not, what level of investment and timing would be necessary to get there?
John Hammergren: That’s a difficult question. I don’t really know where our competitors stand given that these final requirements have just now been published. What I can say is the reason I spent time on this on this call is that our team has not only been involved in helping to set the requirements, but we’re not surprised by them and I believe they believe that we have what it takes to get these products certified and through the process on behalf of our customers. Saying it more frankly, I don’t know how we’d have a clinical business if it weren’t certified so I think it’s almost impossible to believe that we would not achieve certification. And if our competitors certainly can achieve certification, that’s what you’re looking at. We certainly can because there’s no technical reason that we see why that can’t happen. As to the investment, we have made investment in our clinical products, quite significant investments over the last six to 12 months and we continue to make investments, but our heaviest investments right now are really focused on making sure that we can install these products in a time frame for our customers, and there’s a significant ramp in front of us with customers that might have been in a three year plan to install clinical’s that are saying I’d like to move that to 18 months. As you might imagine that puts tremendous strain on our implementation teams and our customers to get ready for stimulus. So we are actually hiring out pretty aggressively because we have to train these people before they are deployed in a hospital and that expense if falling in this quarter and next quarter and we believe it will fall into next year as well as we start those implementations. And as I mentioned in answer to an earlier question, part of our revenue and earnings outlook on this business is predicated on our ability to successfully deploy and install these products, not so much that our contractual obligations have changed with our customers but just from a percentage of completing accounting methodology perspective. If we have a large contract which contains multiple products, our recognition of the entire contract is put off until the final product is installed. So if a customer is going to take 18 months to get a series of products or contracts installed, it will be the 18th month when we finally put the last product in when we will realize the earnings out of it even though we might have invested 18 months worth of expense to get that contract complete for that customer. So I’m less concerned about our ability to get our products certified than I am about our customers to be ready for meaningful use based on the fact that at least 50% of the work that’s necessary is going to be done by them and their staff as opposed to what we try to do from the industry side. There’s a lot of work to be done. But this is all good for us and it’s all going to deliver increased revenues and increased margins.
Operator: Your next question comes from Lisa Gill – J.P. Morgan.
Lisa Gill – J.P. Morgan: There’s still a pretty wide range as we go into the fourth quarter. Maybe you can just walk me through what the key drivers are on either side of your guidance range for the fourth quarter and secondly, it looks like depreciation and amortization went up quite a bit, much more than we expected. I’m wondering if that has to do with some of the investments on the IT side and therefore we’re seeing it through software development, if you could give us an update there.
Jeff Campbell: Let me start with the Q4 question. I’d say really the biggest uncertainty that’s a little tricky to forecast is still the demand around the flu and so that’s probably the biggest thing that would either nudge us toward the higher end of our range or nudge towards the lower end of the range. The second comment I would make is there’s always a little bit of volatility for the modest portion of our compensation from branded manufacturers that comes through price increases and while that’s modest it’s still enough to be noticed in a quarter. Interestingly enough, year to date for our mix of products through 1231, price increases are down slightly though not by a material amount. Based on what we’ve seen so far in January I think we’ll be right in line with our guidance for the year of having price increased being pretty similar to last year. There’s always a little bit of uncertainty from that. So those are probably the two biggest things I’d say at this point in time that could drive this up or down a little bit as we go through the March quarter. As to your second question, the real biggest change on the depreciation and amortization side is that this quarter is the first quarter that we’ve begun to amortize the capitalized cost associated with our Horizon enterprise revenue management product, and so that was almost $8 million in the quarter. You’ll see now that $8 million every quarter for the few years which means that for half of this year and half of next year you’re going to see that as an increase. But the rest of the year over year change in depreciation and amortization is really just the normal increase, I guess it’s another $12 million or so, the normal increase that comes from us spending $350 million to $400 million on various kinds of capital spending each year.
Lisa Gill – J.P. Morgan: I think that you mentioned that X flu you would expect for the entire year that operating margins would be up about 10 basis points in distribution, so if we look at how well you did in the first quarter and then X’ing out the flu going into the fourth quarter, it’s expected to be down year over year consistent with what our expectations are previously but can you remind us what the main driver there is? Is that the Pfizer contracts moving to fee for service or is it more the contract losses or the repricing of Rite Aid?
Jeff Campbell: Let me back up and make sure I’m being clear. For the full year in Distribution Solutions, once you strip out the year over year impact of the flu, we’d expect our operating margin to be up at least 10 basis points for the year and a couple of moving pieces when you think about that are that we have a much more positive contribution from generics.  Our branded sell side margin is down because of the repricing and the loss of a couple of customers that we experienced last year. Our compensation from branded manufacturers is similar to up a tad year over year and then you’ve got some operating expense leverage. So those are really the four components the two biggest of which are the upside from the generics and the headwind we’ve had all year from the customer repricings and losses we experienced late in our fiscal 2009.
Operator: Your next question comes from Charles Lee – Oppenheimer.
Charles Lee – Oppenheimer: Going back to the IT side in terms of meaningful use I understand that when you’re talking about trying to have all your solutions ready for certification, but as I read through the regulations, certification is currently one part of it and I think you alluded to the fact that providers have a lot of work to do. It seems like one of the areas that providers are struggling with is the reporting requirements and the all or none nature to it. It sounds like you’ve had a hand or at least a say in how these regulations were drafted. Can you talk about how in your conversations with CMS how they’re interpreting that and how maybe give a sense as this period goes on you might see some changes to those requirements.
John Hammergren: I think it’s early and inappropriate for me to suggest or forecast changes to the requirements. I would say that my comments were primarily related to the industry’s requirements relative to IT suppliers to get health products certifiable. You are absolutely right that there’ a big requirement on the provider side in terms of what they have to do and frankly the providers are probably better positioned to speak for that and represent themselves in Washington. However that said, we clearly are focused on helping our customers be more successful and we have been working to make all of these regulations slightly more lenient. For example, one of the earlier drafts required that every physician for every order use electronic orders, and that’s just not feasible. It’s not practical. So things like that we’ve been able to change over time and I think we’ve been able to affect legislation. So I’m guardedly optimistic that through the comment period we’ll get some additional interpretation or perhaps a relaxation of some of this and that will help our hospital customers and physician customers get there successfully.
Charles Lee – Oppenheimer: On the flu, just to jump back to the question earlier, I know you didn’t want to talk about next year in great detail but you talked about some opportunities to try to replace some of that. Is this at least a conversation, obviously given your success in performance with CDC this year, have you at least had initial conversations with the government at least in broad terms or is that still a discussion to have at a later point?
John Hammergren: I think we’re in constant discussion with all of our customers about their needs going forward and I think that it’s probably early to forecast what the government is likely to do in terms of vaccine for next year. But I do think that we’re well positioned should they choose to decide to have a centralized federally suggested vaccination program that we’re well positioned to assist with that. But I do think it’s premature for us to suggest that the administration and legislators are likely to pursue that. I think things will unfold as we see this season wrap itself up.
Operator: Your next question comes from Thomas Gallucci – Lazard Capital.
Thomas Gallucci – Lazard Capital: I wanted to confirm one thing. I appreciate all the information about the flu as we’re trying to discern underling trends. First is the increase in the guidance driven by the bigger number that you’re expecting on the flu and you’ve given a lot of details to help us understand the underlying trend, can you give us a sense of what the flu has done on the top line for you this year?
Jeff Campbell: Let me make sure I’ve got the questions right. I think question one was how the flu had impacted our guidance change versus 90 days ago and question two is a question on flu revenue. So assuming that’s right, if you think about the $0.10 increase in our guidance I would really say that’s two things. It’s the fact that we’re $0.15 to $0.20 more optimistic on the flu than we were 90 days ago and that’s partially offset by the fact that we a little surprised this quarter by some legal costs we incurred most of which had to do frankly with some things related to the old HPLC acquisition and amazingly enough some things related to McKesson Chemical which I believe the company sold off in 1987. We’re still dealing with some of the environmental cases. So those things along with some tax discrete items that went against us this quarter offset a little bit of that flu upside. That explains the guidance of where we were 90 days ago to today. In terms of the flu impact on revenues, that’s actually a very good question because the impact on revenues is pretty immaterial to the company. Almost everything we do with regard to the flu is much higher margin from a flu test kit to a generic drug that’s flu related to importantly the CDC contract which is a third party logistics contract where we are not taking the value of the product into our inventory so of course a third party logistics contract always has a much higher margin than our normal distribution arrangement.
John Hammergren: I want to thank all of you on the call for your time today. Let me conclude by saying that our thoughts and prayers go out to those affected by the crisis in Haiti and I certainly want to acknowledge the many McKesson employees who have offered their assistance whether through cash donations, donations of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals to the teams that are working overtime to fulfill orders for vaccines and medicines bound for Haiti. I really want to thank all of you for that contribution.  I’ll now hand the call over to Anna for a review of our upcoming events.
Anna Schrenk:   I have a preview of upcoming events for the financial community. On May 25 we’ll participate in the Oppenheimer Health Care Information technology one on one conference in New York. On March 1 we’ll host our traditional booth side briefing at the Annual Hems Meeting in Atlanta. We will release fourth quarter earnings results in early May. We look forward to seeing you at one of these upcoming events. Thank you and goodbye.

Operator:  Good afternoon and welcome to McKesson Corporation fiscal 2010 second quarter conference call. (Operator Instructions) Today’s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time and I would now like to introduce Miss Ana Schrank, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma’am.
Ana Schrank:  Thank you Melanie. Good afternoon and welcome to the McKesson fiscal 2010 second quarter earnings call. With me today are John Hammergren, McKesson’s Chairman and CEO, and Jeff Campbell, our CFO. John will first provide a business update and will then introduce Jeff, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After Jeff comments we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 6:00 PM Eastern Time. Before we begin I remind listeners that during the course of this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company’s periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements.  Thanks and here is John Hammergren.
John Hammergren:  Thanks Ana and thanks everyone for joining us on our call. I’m pleased with the continued momentum in our business.  Excluding the after tax adjustment to the litigation reserves, we achieved net income of $289 million or $1.07 per diluted share for the second quarter. Total company revenues were $27.1 billion. Our earnings were driven by strong execution in both segments. In the Distribution Solutions segment, operating profit was up 2% and in the Technology Solutions segment operating profit was up 63%. As you might remember from our fourth quarter earnings call, we came into fiscal 2010 with some challenging trends to overcome. Revenues in Technology Solutions were being impacted by the slowing economy. Revenues in portions of our Distribution business were impacted by both the economy and the loss of two customers. And in our U.S. pharmaceutical business we knew that the sell side margin would be down as a result of the events that we experienced last year. To maintain our business momentum we took actions to prepare for a challenging fiscal 2010. We aggressively focused on managing expenses while we looked for innovative new ways to increase our business opportunities or expand our relationships with existing customers. We’re two quarters into the year and I’m very pleased with the results. We have been successful with our cost control efforts across the company, resulting in significant margin expansion. Additionally we have looked for innovative ways to expand our business. For example, in U.S. PhRMA we are ramping up our recently launched plasma distribution business and we have secured agreements with two existing customers that expand our presence in this important segment. And across several of our distribution businesses, we quickly moved into action when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called upon us to expand our existing relationship in the face of the H1N1 flu pandemic. Before I talk about the specifics of the quarter, I want to take a moment to highlight this partnership with the CDC. McKesson was selected by the CDC to handle the centralized distribution of the H1N1 flu vaccine to all 50 states and to the District of Columbia, making this one of the largest public health initiatives in the CDC’s history. Our distribution effort brings together the vaccines from five different manufacturers and involves shipping the doses to as many as 150,000 provider sites. As you know our Specialty Care Solutions business has a contract with the CDC for distribution of its public sector of vaccines through the Vaccines for Children Program.  When faced with the possibility that the H1N1 virus could become a pandemic, the CDC realized that the critical nature of the H1N1 vaccination program and the short timeline before deployment required them to leverage available tools and approaches to distributing the vaccine. The CDC determined that McKesson as the already established centralized vaccine distributor would be the logical choice to ramp up and begin distribution within the required 90 day window.  But our Specialty Care Solutions team could not do it alone. U.S. PhRMA and Medical Surgical partnered with Specialty to establish the logistics, staffing and information technology infrastructure that was necessary. And six times every day Relay Health provides anti-viral prescription data to the CDC for monitoring the H1N1 virus and other disease outbreaks. Truly, a one McKesson effort.  In just eight weeks we have created from scratch what amounts to a new business, with six new distribution centers, four of which are dedicated to distribution of the vaccine and two of which are dedicated to ancillary medical surgical supplies. We’ve put test orders through the system before product was available to insure the vaccines would be distributed without delay. We created a customer service support group, hired and trained service representatives and conducted internally driven test calls. We shipped the first orders beginning Sunday, October 4th. Although we are still in the early stages of the program, our efforts thus far have had terrific success. Since the beginning, we’ve been delivering the doses to the identified providers in a fully compliant, temperature controlled way.  In addition to the H1N1 vaccine initiative, we anticipate a broader impact to McKesson from the flu season as we ship products such as Tamiflu and Relenza through U.S. Pharmaceutical, field calls to our nurse hotlines in our Health Solutions business and distribute an historically high number of flu test kits and other supplies through Medical Surgical. We certainly expect to carry out all of our flu related distribution efforts successfully and I’m very proud of the way the organization continues to execute across the board. The precise financial impact of this year’s flu season is challenging to estimate at this early date, but we are expecting a positive impact on the company’s financial results.  Moving on to some of the specifics for the second quarter, Distribution Solutions performed well with solid contributions from all of our businesses. As I mentioned before Distribution Solutions revenues continued to be impacted by the loss of two customer buying groups in U.S. Pharmaceutical. So while we have experienced growth in our existing customer base, our top line will be impacted by the lost business for the remainder of our fiscal year. The other dynamic in the U.S. Pharmaceutical business is that our sell side margin is down as a result of the events that we experienced last fiscal year. Consistent with comments we made in the fourth quarter, it will take us the full fiscal year to lap this impact. We had an excellent performance with our generics program, which we have developed into a highly attractive offering with a solid infrastructure, high fill rates and a sophisticated order entry system, making us very well positioned to meet the distinct needs of both our customers and our suppliers. One stop sales were down a little because of last year’s loss of an independent buying group customer, but the team is focused on what we can control such as better compliance within our existing customer base and using our size and sophistication and sourcing. The team’s efforts allowed us to grow generic gross profit in the quarter, however.  Our U.S. Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services revenues include not only our U.S. Pharmaceutical Distribution business but also our Specialty Distribution business. And in the second quarter our Specialty Care Solutions business performed very well, benefiting from the launch of generic Oxaliplatin.  Turning to other businesses in the Distribution Solutions segment, our Medical Surgical business, which is a leading position in the alternate site market, had a solid contribution to the overall success of Distribution Solutions. As I mentioned previously, all of our businesses will likely benefit in the next quarter or two from the increased demand related to the flu season. But in this quarter, Medical Surgical’s operating results were driven by expense control measures, the successful integration of some newly acquired businesses and our focus on optimizing our sourcing of McKesson branded products. Lastly, we had a solid performance in our Canadian Distribution business as the pharmaceutical market there has remained slightly stronger than in the United States. And through our global sourcing initiatives, we are realizing synergies across our North American Pharmaceutical Distribution businesses. I’m extremely pleased with all the efforts we’ve made to control costs and find new business opportunities throughout Distribution Solutions. We achieved strong sales results despite the challenges we faced coming into the year, and we expect our momentum to continue for the remainder of this fiscal year. Turning now to Technology Solutions. Technology Solutions diverse portfolio and the fact that much of our revenue comes from predictable, recurring streams has helped to mitigate the impact of the slower economy. This quarter revenues were up modestly and operating margin expanded considerably due to ongoing expense management initiatives and improving operating performance across the business. We never talk specifically about funnels and pipelines, but generally speaking I can report the pipeline continues to be strong and there is tremendous interest in our Solutions, much of which should convert to bookings. And as we compare our results to last year’s low base, software bookings are up modestly for the quarter. But the financial landscape has not changed much since our last call. There is still tremendous pressure on healthcare providers and hospital economics have not improved. So while the stimulus continues to generate customer interest in our Solutions, particularly the clinical products and our Relay Health offering, we haven’t seen yet a significant shift in buying behavior.  Because the stimulus has focused providers on clinical solutions, the short term tradeoff for a company such as McKesson is there might be slower growth in non-clinical software. And with the definition of meaningful use delayed, even some clinical software buyers are on the sidelines. McKesson has a broad solutions set including financial and clinical offerings for hospitals, payers, pharmacies and physicians. We are well positioned to benefit from the healthcare information technology stimulus and the broader focus on healthcare reform.  In the second quarter our new comprehensive financial solution, Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management, became generally available. This was a milestone for McKesson because we’ve brought to the market a solution that applies a different approach for healthcare reimbursement. For decades, McKesson has been the leader in financial systems for providers with great product expertise and the largest customer base in the industry. But the financial systems that are installed in hospitals today are more than 20 years old and they were created at a time when healthcare reimbursement was different. So most of the work of these systems takes place after the patient leaves the hospital. Horizon ERM redesigns the billing cycle by moving many of the billing functions to before or during the case. It enables consumers to become more active in their care by going online and comparing prices of procedures and pre-registering from home. It includes the collection of information that is valuable when treating the patient, meeting regulatory requirements and collecting full payment for services as they’re delivered.  Another great aspect to Horizon ERM is it is compatible with the clinical systems that have been installed over the past five to ten years. We built the architecture to be open to both McKesson and non-McKesson clinical systems. It has online connectivity between the provider, the payer and the patient. And the system incorporates other McKesson software and solutions such as [Intercall] content and Relay Health tools. McKesson has the right products and solutions to help our hospital and physician customers prepare for the government’s definition of meaningful use. Therefore we are concentrating on achieving superior execution with implementations and maintaining a laser focus on our customers’ satisfaction. Beyond the core clinical and financial solutions we have for hospitals and physicians, we also focus on solutions for the payer market through our health solutions business. As well as connectivity, it cuts across all healthcare constituents through our Relay Health business. McKesson health solutions uniquely combines expert technology with evidence based, clinical information to enable payers to manage their administrative and medical costs. Our payer customers have access to the industry’s most robust set of solutions to help them manage their financial, administrative and clinical processes and improve quality. In Health Solutions our footprint is unparalleled. All of the top 25 managed care organizations and more than 90% of the Blue Cross Blue Shield plans depend on our solutions to help manage their business. Additionally, Intercall continues its decade long leadership for clinical decision support among quality improvement organizations for Medicare programs, Medicaid initiatives and private quality assurance programs. Health Solutions just hosted its 22nd annual client conference in San Francisco. We spent four days speaking with over 170 organizations about how McKesson can help address their most pressing business issues. An important focus this year was innovation and we showcased several new products for the payer market. In our Relay Health business we have both a comprehensive software as a service platform and an intelligent network that processes healthcare transactions. Relay facilitates the exchange of information among health systems, labs, pharmacies, payers, physicians, pharmaceutical manufacturers, government agencies and of course consumers. By linking together all constituents in the healthcare continuum, eliminating data silos and engaging the consumer, Relay Health is enabling more informed decisions, reducing costs and facilitating care coordination to reduce errors and drive better outcomes. Capitalizing on our innovative programs we’ve processed nearly 13 billion clinical and financial transactions annually that improve cash flow, reduce cost and enhance patient outcomes. Ultimately our solutions will also help health systems and physicians meet interoperability criteria as outlined in the High Tech Act. The solutions have short implementation times, are easy to use and are low cost with no hardware to purchase or software license fees. As an established leader in pharmaceutical and supply distribution, McKesson is now establishing a leadership position in information distribution. The Technology Solutions portfolio of products and services is unmatched in the industry. Rapid change is preventing and presenting a unique opportunity and we can extend our lead if we appropriately balance innovation with solid execution. I’m pleased with the second quarter performance of Technology Solutions, particularly the strong contribution from the cost containment measures we implemented beginning last fiscal year.  In summary, I’m confident that many of the positive trends from our first half of the year will continue and every business will maintain its focus on controlling discretionary expenses. Our first half results give us great momentum and because of this momentum and the anticipated positive impact from the increased demand from the flu season, we are raising our full year expectations and now expect earnings per diluted share of $4.45 to $4.60, excluding adjustments to the litigation reserves for fiscal 2010.  With that, I’ll turn the call over to Jeff and will return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?
Jeff Campbell:  Well thanks John and good afternoon everyone. As you’ve just heard McKesson continues to execute, to drive effective cost controls and to grow profit. McKesson has turned in another solid operational performance that resulted in a strong first half for the fiscal year.  Before I begin reviewing our financial performance, let me point out that our second quarter results have benefited from a $12 million after tax litigation reserve release of $0.04 per diluted share. My discussion for the quarter and the full year will be on the basis of our earnings excluding the litigation credit for comparison purposes. As usual, I’ll begin by discussing our consolidated results. I’ll provide additional color when I discuss each segment in more detail. Revenues for the quarter grew 2% at $27.1 billion, pretty much in line with our original expectations for the year. I’d remind you of our assumptions for the full year, which was for the economy and the financial markets to show a modest uptick towards the end of our fiscal 2010. These assumptions still apply. Gross profit for the quarter was up 3% to $1.3 billion with both segments contributing to this growth. Moving below the gross profit line, our total operating expenses for the quarter were down 4% to $888 million. The lower expenses were driven primarily by the cost containment efforts we put in place beginning last year in response to the difficult economic environment. Our operating expenses also benefited from the sale of two businesses in our prior year, a stronger dollar, as well as the legal settlement we discussed in our July earnings call impacting the company’s 401(k) plan that will provide about $0.03 to $0.04 of year-over-year benefit each quarter this year. Operating income for the quarter grew 17% to $447 million from $381 million a year ago. Recall this is $447 million excludes the benefit of the $20 million litigation credit. Moving below operating income, other income was $4 million compared to $33 million in the prior year. The prior year benefited from the sale of our equity interest in Verispan, which resulted in a pretax gain of $24 million or approximately $0.05 per diluted share. The remainder of the decline in other income was primarily due to lower interest income resulting from lower prevailing [trest] rates.  Interest expense for the quarter of $47 million increased due to the $700 million in debt we issued in February.  Moving to taxes, our effective tax rate of approximately 29% benefited from $13 million of favorable discrete tax items but is otherwise roughly in line with the 32% run rate we continue to expect for the full year. Our effective tax rate in the prior year was just 13.7% and was impacted by $76 million in positive discrete tax items, equating to $0.27 per diluted share. Net income excluding the litigation credit was $289 million and diluted earnings per share excluding the litigation credit was $1.07. To wrap up our consolidated results, this year’s EPS number was aided by the cumulative impact of our share repurchases, which lowered our diluted weighted average shares outstanding by 3% year-over-year to 271 million shares. Let’s now move on to Distribution Solutions. In this segment, revenue growth overall was 2% compared to the same quarter last year. Direct Distribution and Services revenues were 7% due to market growth rates, partially offset by the losses in fiscal 2009 of several customers that we have previously discussed. Similar to the trend we highlighted in our last earnings call, our direct revenues also benefited from a large customer shifting warehouse purchases to direct store delivery. This mix shift by the large customer was also the primary driver of the 13% decline in our sales to customers’ warehouses. Canadian revenues on a constant currency basis grew 9% for the quarter due to market growth rates. Including an unfavorable currency impact of 6%, Canadian revenues grew 3% for the quarter. As I’ve said in the past, given our large IT workforce in Canada we are fairly hedged on the Canadian dollar on a consolidated operating profit basis. Medical Surgical Distribution revenues were up 5% for the quarter to $734 million, benefiting from the effect of some small acquisitions we made in fiscal 2009. Gross profit for the segment was up 1% to $960 million from $951 million a year ago, a modest revenue growth resulting in a reduction to our gross margin rate of 4 basis points. As we’ve talked about for a couple of quarters now, our sell margin was negatively impacted by customer renewals and the loss of customers that occurred late in our fiscal 2009. We are pleased however that year-over-year growth in our generics profit and compensation under agreements with our branded manufacturers offset much of the sell margin impact. Our Distribution Solutions operating expenses were down 4% for the quarter to $546 million, reflecting the prior year sale of our specialty pharmaceutical business and our continued focus on containing costs.  Operating margin rate for the quarter was 158 basis points compared to 157 basis points in the prior year. But it’s important to note that the prior year sale of our equity interest in Verispan that I mentioned earlier benefited the Distribution Solutions segment. Excluding this sale from the prior year operating margin, our rate improved 10 basis points. In summary and before I move on to Technology Solutions, we’re very pleased with our ability to mitigate the challenges we faced at the beginning of this fiscal year and to see the continued strength of our businesses within Distribution Solutions, driven by sound expense management, consistent execution and innovation. In Technology Solutions, total revenues grew 4% for the quarter to $790 million. Contributing to this increase was the recognition of $22 million in previously deferred revenues triggered by the Horizon’s Enterprise Revenue Management Solution becoming generally available in the quarter. As the GA of Horizon ERM impacted each of the revenue lines, I’ll call out the relative benefit.  Services revenues increased 5% in the quarter to $613 million or 3% excluding the impact of the Horizon ERM GA. This 3% growth reflects the more stable nature of our service remedies.  Software and software systems revenues of $142 million increased 1% from the prior year and hardware revenues of $35 million in the quarter were down 13% from the prior year. Excluding the Horizon ERM GA impact, software and software systems revenues declined 2% and hardware revenues were down 25%. Technology Solutions experienced gross margin expansion of 141 basis points with gross profit for this segment up 7% to $375 million. Approximately half of the basis point improvement came as a result of the Horizon ERM GA since some of the associated expenses were recognized as incurred in prior periods. The remainder of the gross margin rate improvement was primarily due to a favorable revenue mix. Technology Solutions operating expenses decreased 8% in the quarter to $260 million. These lower expenses were primarily due to cost containment efforts across the segment in response to the economic slowdown.  We continue to innovate and invest in R&D to maintain our leadership position. For the quarter, Technology Solutions had total gross R&D spending of $102 million, which is actually slightly more than in the prior year. Of this amount, we capitalized 20% compared to 17% in prior year. Our operating profit in our Technology Solutions segment this quarter was $116 million, up 63% from the $71 million we recorded a year ago. Our operating margin in this segment was up to 14.68% for the quarter compared to 9.32% in the prior year. Although we are pleased with this margin expansion, there are a number of factors driving it. We continued to see success with our cost containment initiatives, but there were certain other factors that contributed to the margin increase. We benefited from the impact of the Horizon ERM GA as well as the legal settlement impacting the company’s 401(k) plan, which in particular benefits this segment. Last, recall that the prior year operating margin rate was adversely impacted as a result of the financial crisis and its impact on our customers. Leaving our segment performance now and turning briefly to the balance sheet and our working capital metrics. Our receivables were $7.8 billion which is up from the prior year balance of $7 billion. However, our days sales outstanding remained flat at 23 days after adjusting the prior year for the $497 million utilization of our AR sales facility.  Moving on to inventories, as a result of carefully managing our inventory levels, we continued to see improvement in our days sales in inventory. Additionally, last year we did some earlier buying for our normal seasonal build. As a result of these two events, our days sales in inventory was 30 days, a nice improvement of 3 days compared to last year. Our inventories were $8.6 billion on September 30, a 6% decrease over last year. Our payables increased 5% to $12.7 billion from a year ago and days sales in payables increased to 44 days from 43 days last year. Importantly, both the DSI and DSP metrics showed modest improvement from what we posted at the end of last quarter. These working capital improvements resulted in McKesson generating $1.5 billion in operating cash flow year-to-date. Based on this start, we now expect to generate in the range of $1.5 to $2 billion of operating cash in fiscal 2010, excluding the AWP payment. This strong and early in our year cash flow generation contributed to McKesson posting a cash balance of $3.2 billion at September 30. Much of this balance is due to timing. As I just mentioned, our cash flow came in earlier this year. In addition, we had expected to make a $295 million AWP payment in the second quarter but it actually happened after the quarter ended. We also have $215 million in debt coming due in February. We remain committed over the long term to our portfolio approach to capital deployment. To that end, we repurchased $299 million worth of shares year-to-date. Consistent with our update in our last earnings call, we continue to expect our full year average share count to come in a bit below the original guidance we provided of 272 million shares outstanding. And our capital spending continues to trend as expected at $350 to $400 million for the year. Now let me turn to our outlook. As John mentioned earlier, we are raising our guidance on diluted EPS excluding this quarter’s $0.04 adjustment to our litigation reserves from $4.15 to $4.30 to a new range of $4.45 to $4.60. There are several contributors to this guidance change so I’ll walk through each one in turn. First, we benefited approximately $0.05 from favorable discrete tax items recognized in our second quarter. Second, we will recognize in our third quarter approximately $0.05 related to the sale of our 50% stake in the joint venture of McKesson Logistics Solutions, a third party logistics provider in Canada. So these two items account for about $0.10 of our $0.30 increase in guidance. The remaining $0.20 is a mixture of two factors, our momentum from the strong operational start to the year and our expectations around the way that the flu season will impact us including our expanded relationship with the CDC. There are many combinations of these two factors that might get us into our range and both factors are material. So let me comment in particular on the uncertainty surrounding the flu season and the resulting challenge that we have estimating its financial impact. We have many businesses that in varying degrees will be affected by the flu season. We have seen over the last six months and may expect to see in the next six months many things including increased call volumes at our nurse triage centers and our payer business, higher volumes of Tamiflu, Relenza and other flu related generic drugs that move through our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, more physician office visits that drive demand for ancillary medical supplies including flu test kits through our Medical Surgical distribution business, varying volumes of seasonal flu vaccines that we ship through both our Medical Surgical distribution business as well as through our longstanding contract with the CDC to distribute children’s vaccines, and various volume, timing and requirements that will ultimately drive pricing stemming from our exclusive relationship with the CDC to distribute H1N1 flu vaccine and related supplies. We are fully prepared for what is to come but there is a great deal of uncertainty about this flu season, how severe, how pervasive across the country, the timing and duration. And separately there are questions about the timing and availability of the vaccine supply, the pull through of vaccine by the state health departments, the utilization by the public of the available H1N1 flu vaccine and what the final terms will be of the modifications to our existing relationship with the CDC. Therefore we have incorporated into our guidance what we believe to be a reasonable yet modest assumption related to the flu season. The financial impact could be more or less and it could potentially have a material impact on our earnings that drives us above or below the range we are giving you today. As the year unfolds, we will help you understand the final financial impact of the flu on our fiscal year. We will do this once we have the full facts. As one data point for you, in our September quarter results the overall impact of the flu on our earnings appears to be fairly flat year-over-year. We recognized a net $16 million of start up expenses in the September quarter on our CDC contract and this offset the year-over-year earnings upside we saw elsewhere in the company on the flu. In the face of this uncertainty, my usual comments about our quarterly progression are also challenging. The positive trends that helped drive our first half results are continuing and we expect that this momentum will carry into our back half of the year. The flu is likely to impact us more in our December quarter than the March quarter. If this is correct, then we would still expect to see our fourth quarter as the strongest of the year but the December quarter could be very close to it. In closing, we’re pleased with the performance across all our businesses and feel that McKesson has executed well through the first half of fiscal 2010.  Thanks and with that I’ll turn the call over to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Charles Boorady - Citi Investment Research.
Charles Boorady - Citi Investment Research:  You mentioned the $6 million start up costs for the CDC contract. I understood that was a cost plus contract so was that a $6 million net expense that you’re not getting reimbursed for or is there a timing difference on when you’d recognize revenues related to that?
Jeff Campbell: It’s strictly timing, Charles. As you said all the outcomes are positive although we’re still working through the final terms with the CDC but the accounting does not necessarily follow the payment. And so the revenues will more be recognized along with shipments and the shipments started on October 4.
Charles Boorady - Citi Investment Research:  And then on Tech Solutions, and I appreciate the additional time John spent talking about the business, and I wonder when do you think we’ll see the inflection point in revenues related to the increased demand that many of your competitors are talking about? You’ve been talking about post-stimulus and related to that, is there going to be a point where you need to ramp up your selling expense ahead of when you would recognize the growth in revenues? Or will the timing generally match between your revenue growth and selling expense growth in that business?
John Hammergren:
 : Well I think it’s a little bit early to say when is it actually going to hit an inflection point. I guess what I can say is that our field organizations are actively involved in a level of discussions with our customers that we haven’t seen for quite some time. And it’s along two paths. One is the discussion around implementation of product that might have already been purchased but we have not you know recognized the full opportunity because it hasn’t been implemented or installed fully. So even products like physician order entry products or Horizon Expert orders that might have been purchased several years ago, when these products are now desired for stimulus and for meaningful use, they’re focused on how fast can we get them in.  And then there’s a second track of discussion which are those customers who have not bought a complete enough solutions set to begin thinking about how can we get ready for stimulus and make sure that we’re making this happen. I think our sales investment is probably about where it needs to be. Frankly the investment in implementation support staff is commensurate really with our visibility to when customers are going to be ready to implement and want to implement. So you’ll probably see that investment continuing not only this year but also into next year as we think about what’s necessary to make it happen. And clearly we’re excited about Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management. The launch of that product has stirred up a sense of interest in many of our customers who understand that the complexity related to the financial side of the business is going to continue to increase, and that individuals and consumer directed health plans are going to have more responsibility to pay for their own care, which increases the complexity of dealing with multiple parties related to recovery of payment for services that have been provided. I think, Charles, overall we’re pretty optimistic. That inflection point clearly we see out beyond the end of this fiscal year in terms of meaningful impact from a revenue perspective and that’s why our guidance this year continued to be somewhat soft from a revenue perspective. But as we get closer to next year we’ll have a better feel for that.
Operator: Your next question comes from Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse.
Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse: Yes, John, just a couple of quick questions. You were talking about a lot of momentum in your business and you know people have been paying attention to physician office visits and all the flu data out there and the IMS data. Are you really seeing a swell in volumes here recently in the past month in your drug distribution business? Do you think these incremental physician office visits are translating into more scripts?
John Hammergren: Well clearly we’re optimistic as we look forward that this flu season could have a positive impact on our business more than it has thus far. You know clearly September and October you began to see more media coverage about it and more interest. And I think that you know we really didn’t see a lot of effect in our businesses in the September quarter other than as Jeff mentioned I think we had flu test kits started to sell well in our Med Surg business. But remember that business also has a lot of other businesses in it. And so you know to the extent that the flu business might be impacting the physician side, we have Z Medical for example that sells into businesses which continues to suffer the take down in terms of employment, etc. So I think we’re optimistic as we look into the next couple of quarters but thus far we haven’t seen a significant bolus of new demand.
Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse:  And then just a quick question on the IT side. The deferred revenues you recognized in the quarter, when did they come from? Were they from last year or were they kind of recognized last quarter?
John Hammergren: Jeff will talk about the revenue specific but you know the complexity of this business is that things like enterprise revenue management is a big word that encompasses lots of different products and lots of things that are tied into a large contract or a sale with a customer. So some of these sales might have taken place years ago. Jeff?
Jeff Campbell: Correct. And in fact many of them did. And most of the revenues, Glen, that were recognized were actually not for the Horizon ERM product but they were for other ancillary products that the customer purchased as part of a bundled purchase that had been installed and customer’s been using for a long time. But the trigger for revenue recognition is completion of the final element in the contract which is the GA of Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management.
John Hammergren: So although we sold a lot of the HERM product already, because it takes a while to implement it, actual HERM revenue will be more material as we think about the out year, I mean next year probably more so than this year. So this is stuff that was installed and hung up on the balance sheet until we can get it recognized.
Operator: Your next question comes from Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets: I guess just first following up on Glen’s question there, given that you probably have some idea of the timing there, so did you anticipate already the benefit from that in your original guidance?
Jeff Campbell: Yes.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets:  And then I guess within the changes to the guidance, Jeff, you had mentioned sort of a general bucket of business momentum. What sort of are the key drivers that you’re thinking about when you sort of think about that bucket?
Jeff Campbell: Well I’d really go back to the many things that John and I talked about across the business, Tom. It’s momentum across every aspect of what we do. I’d say a common theme is strong cost containment efforts that have gone frankly better than we had anticipated when we put together the plan. That’s probably the one common thing.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets:  I think you mentioned the one stop program was down a bit due to the client loss. Do you have what the adjusted number might be so we can get a sense of what the underlying business is doing?
John Hammergren:
 : I think it’s fair to say the underlying business is continuing to expand. You know it’s not the kind of rate of increase that you might have seen in years past, Tom, because we’re lapping things like Safeway that were big net incremental new customers. But we’re still very pleased with the progress we’re making in the generics business. And if you look at our total revenue growth in the corporation on the pharmaceutical distribution side, the fact that we were able to lose nearly $3 billion in revenue and still get some growth out of the business I think is a tribute to the strength of the market but also the strength of our ability to continue to execute with our customers and get more and more of their business driven through McKesson. So I think we’re well positioned there and I think we remain optimistic about the progress we’re making with generics.
Operator: Your next question comes from Randall Stanicky - Goldman Sachs.
Randall Stanicky - Goldman Sachs: John, one of the things that I missed highlighting was some potential inventory management that they’re seeing at retail. Have you seen anything from where you sit that would be contributing to their renewed focus or their renewed growth outlook on the mid single digits?
John Hammergren: Yes, not to sound negative but we sometimes have a hard time explaining the nuances associated with IMS’s forecast. Certainly the direction that they take we typically agree with but the science behind the numbers is sometimes more of a challenge. So I think that we believe that there is continued to be some demand drivers here that are helpful to us but beyond that we probably don’t focus on a near term basis in terms of what IMS is saying. And I’d say that their projections as revised now are probably more reflective of what we thought the year was going to be anyway as opposed to their earlier guidance which was down I think. We just didn’t see it going negative.
Randall Stanicky - Goldman Sachs:  How about from a sell side margin perspective, one of the things that obviously you talked about last quarter that you’re saying had improved was the outlook on that front. If you talk to customers here and clearly there’s a couple of customers out there as we look out for the next six to 12 months that won’t hurt to matter from a renewal perspective, are you seeing anything different from a pressure perspective on that front?
John Hammergren: Well the market remains competitive, Randall. As I’ve said in the past I think we have to constantly look for ways to innovate with our solutions set to take the focus off of price and focus more on value and what we can deliver. And I think that we continue to deliver more value than we charge for from the service perspective. So typically our sell side pressure is driven by competitive activity, perhaps in addition to a customers interest to get a better deal. And we talked last year about the sell side pressure we experienced in the fourth quarter and frankly when we drew the line in the sand we lost $3 billion worth of revenue. So sometimes our attempt to hold the sell side in place is met with negative consequences. We continue to believe though that the only way to continue to expand margins in our business is to have discipline around the selling process, to sell the full value of the company, and to obviously do great work in cost management and in things like generics that help drive margins on the positive side and reduce the bleeding as it relates to sell side margin degradation. So I don’t want you to believe in my comments that the sell side “has turned around”. I would say that what we’re suggesting is that the negative pressure we felt in the fourth quarter we built into the guidance this year has been experienced and we continue to manage aggressively against our customer’s expectations, the competitive activity and our ability to hold the line on price so that we can actually get margin expansion, which is our ultimate goal here. The key to softening revenues is to get gross profit expansion and that is critical to this model.
Randall Stanicky - Goldman Sachs:  And even with some of the CDC north of some of the H1N1 noise, in the numbers we should expect to see margins continue to expand over the next couple of quarters?
Jeff Campbell: You’re focused on operating margins, Randall? I mean on the operating margin side you’ll actually see a very significant expansion due to the flu. Because the mix of products is a little higher margin than normal and the CDC contract is a third party logistic contract. So we don’t recognize the product revenue that will drive the margin up. After the fact we’ll tell you what the impact is on all that. We do expect the operating margin in Distribution Solutions to go up for the year, even once you adjust for those items.
Operator: Your next question comes from Lisa Gill - J.P. Morgan.
Lisa Gill - J.P. Morgan: Jeff, just to come back to the guidance and you talked about the $0.20. Within that you said that CDC is in there. Is the entire CDC contract within that $0.20 or you’re not quite sure how it’s going to work out? Maybe can you just walk us through how you’re getting paid on this 3 PL contract? Is it based on the number of shipments you have? Is it based on just a contract that you signed overall with them?
Jeff Campbell: Well remember we have a longstanding contract with the CDC on their Children’s Vaccine Program. And what we are actually doing is just extending that contract to cover what we’re doing on very short notice for H1N1. There are actually three components economically to that expansion, Lisa. One, covering the costs that I’ll call the set of costs of setting up fixed distribution centers and the technology and hiring a couple thousand people. Second component is a component to cover the monthly operating expenses of running that network. And the third component is a variable component that depends upon the number of doses actually shipped.  So our challenge in giving guidance of course is the tremendous variability I’d say right now on how many doses will be shipped. There’s tremendous variability on the timing of when those doses get shipped which also affects our economics. And then as the CDC and McKesson and other partners work together every day to figure out how to do this a little bit better, frankly what we’re doing for the CDC continues to evolve and that is reflected on pricing. So what we’ve tried to do in our guidance range is give you our best estimate, given all that uncertainty I just described, of what we think is a reasonable assumption for the economics this year on the CDC. But as I said in my prepared remarks, there’s enough uncertainty here so I’d say we could be materially off in either direction. But we think we’ve been modest and reasonable in the range we’ve given you.
Lisa Gill - J.P. Morgan:  I guess what I just want to understand is that you said you could be modestly off on either side, I don’t really understand how you could be off on the downside, right, though? Aren’t they covering the costs? So if the costs?
Jeff Campbell: Yes. I’m sorry, Lisa. I’m just talking about on the downside relative to the guidance range we’ve given you. And we took our guidance range up a whole lot. 
John Hammergren: So we don’t expect that this will not be a financial benefit. It’s a question of the size of the benefit and that’s what Jeff was attempting to explain. So we won’t lose money on the deal regardless of what the outcome is.
Lisa Gill - J.P. Morgan:  And I think what we’re trying to understand, John, is just you know the underlying fundamentals of the business so we pull out H1N1 and we just really try to understand what’s happening with McKesson. You’ve put up a number of really strong quarters, drug distribution, while margins were a little bit lower than what we expected you are building momentum there. We knew about some of the repricing of the contracts and maybe if you could talk about the conversion from warehouse sales over to direct store sales. I mean that should have a positive impact over time as well. Right?
John Hammergren: Yes. We think that the drug distribution business and let’s not forget that H1N1 really hasn’t had any impact other than the set up costs in the quarter we just reported. So the strength you see in our financial results in Q2 were driven by the ongoing operations of the corporation without regard to sort of the H1N1 effect, with the exception of the ERM GA which is kind of the abnormal thing in the Technology Solutions segment that was more one time kind of related. So I think we feel very strongly that the business is well positioned to continue to perform. We’re lapping this $3 billion loss and the price effect that that has had from a market perspective. And we’re continuing to innovate to try to deliver additional value. So I think we feel very positive about how we’re positioned in those businesses.  As to the transition between warehouse and direct store sales, I think that that is a continued indication of the value we deliver for our customers, that when they say listen we want you to ship to our stores directly as opposed to us using our warehouses as an intermediary, it certainly shows confidence that our logistics channel is as good or better for the customers. You know and generally speaking DXD business for us is more profitable than warehouse business and this most significant move that we’ve had with one of our larger customers, its still positive but perhaps not as positive as an independent direct store delivery model as opposed to you know a chain direct delivery model. 
Lisa Gill - J.P. Morgan:  I mean I know a bunch of people asked this, but sequentially the expectation is that drug distribution’s going to continue to get better. That’s correct over the December and March quarter just like we’ve seen historically? And that’s it for me.
John Hammergren: Yes.
Jeff Campbell: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Ransom - Raymond James.
John Ransom - Raymond James: Drug inflation this year has been low double digits, which is the strongest we’ve seen. And recognizing that your fee for service just how much of a benefit is that? And conversely if inflation fell say 300 or 400 points next year, how would this affect your hybrid deals and how should we think about that if at all?
John Hammergren: Well I think we might have had some modest lift from the price patterns in the last two quarters, but as you suggested we have basically taken the variability out of this business to a large degree. Plus the price inflation depending on which manufacturers it falls on can have a immaterial effect or a material effect given the structure of some of our relationships. So I think that what we’ve experienced thus far and what we planned for for the balance of the year is generally in line with the expectation we had as we started the year.  And as we look to next year you know there might be an environment where price inflation is lower than what it is today or what we’ve experienced today. Because as I said it really depends on the mix of manufacturers that make those changes as well as how our arrangements with the manufacturers vary. And I think our ultimate goal is to make sure that we’re properly paid for the work that we do. And to the extent that there’s some significant change to the models as a result of behavior changes out of our control, we certainly would go back and adjust those models hopefully to reflect the fact that our work has remained the same.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robert Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch
Robert Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch: John or Jeff, are there any more IT revenue opportunities in any of these deferred revenues that might pop up in the second half that’s in your guidance and any material?
Jeff Campbell:
 : No. Horizon ERM is a uniquely scaled or large project. There’s nothing else anywhere close to that.
Robert Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch:  And with the $3 billion in cash, you know what businesses under your roof stand to benefit the most either from internal investment or acquisitions?
John Hammergren: Well you know clearly we have used a portfolio approach to the deployment of cash, Robert. And we will plan to continue that pursuit. At least that’s our current thinking. We use dividends, we use acquisitions and we use share repurchases as part of that portfolio. I think all of our businesses continue to have opportunities for us to make strategic acquisitions that fit in sort of the wheel house of the businesses. And I think we’ll continue to evaluate across the board. There are some that might be reaching points of competitive saturation which makes it difficult to find additional parties to roll in. But even in those larger businesses where there are only a few players left, the ability for us to make acquisitions that might serve more innovation opportunities for us are certainly present as well. So I think it really will be across the board.
Robert Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch:  Can you possibly flush out? I mean I’m hard pressed to see where you can go from a distribution standpoint either Drug or Med Surg. I mean are there real avenues there that you’ve not yet tapped or explored?
John Hammergren: Well I think distribution is a big sector for us and that we made acquisitions in our medical distribution business for example that have been successful in expanding our footprint. I don’t think that that market has been fully consolidated and whether it’s home health distribution or whether it’s physical therapy distribution or whether it’s nursing home distribution or physician office distribution, clearly that’s a big segment for us and there’s plenty of opportunity with smaller players that are privately owned where they’ll find a nice fit with us. To your point though pharmaceutical wholesaling in North America has consolidated significantly and there may be fewer opportunities in that segment. But once again I think there’s places where we can find space to invest.
Operator: Your next question comes from Richard Close - Jefferies & Co.
Richard Close - Jefferies & Co.: Jeff, just wanted to be clear on not looking at this apples versus oranges here. When we look at your guidance from the coming out of the first quarter you said $4.15 to $4.30 and $0.15 from the legal settlement was in there. And now you’re saying $4.45 to $4.60 and then you say excluding an adjustment to the litigation reserves. So?
Jeff Campbell: I’m sorry, Richard. We confused everyone. Its two different things. What we talked about in the July quarter is that the company’s 401(k) plan had actually reached a legal settlement. The net effect of that was about a $0.15 good guy for all of our fiscal year ’10. That was built into the $4.15 to $4.30 range and remains built into our new higher range. Separately and totally unrelated, in the September quarter we settled and released a $20 million reserve on an old legal case that has to do with the HBOC acquisition. If you look at our income statement, if you look at Schedule 1 you’ll see a little table down at the bottom that builds you from a GAAP 111 EPS to a 107 EPS and we built our guidance off that 107. It’s a convention we’ve used for a number of years now to exclude some of the somewhat random noise around settlements relating to both the HBOC acquisition as well as the AWP litigation.
John Hammergren: So when Jeff talked about the securities litigation or litigation matters, those are the two call outs that he’s referring to. Unless we say otherwise it’s either AWP or it’s the securities litigation from back in 1999.
Richard Close - Jefferies & Co.:  And then when we think about the you know the operating margin and the progression, your comments there, you see improvement in the back half of this year. Is there anything you can note I guess the sequential decline from first quarter to second quarter that maybe we should be aware of? Obviously you have the start up costs on the H1N1. Anything else there?
Jeff Campbell:
 : Well when you think about operating margin and Distribution Solutions, Rich as you know we encourage people to only look upon it on a rolling four quarter basis. You can’t look at it sequentially. There’s quarterly volatility. So for the four quarters of fiscal year ’10 we would expect that operating margin rate in Distribution Solutions before any impact from the flu to be up by some single digit [safe] points. Now the flu if it occurs as we think it will, will have a quite dramatic impact on that rate in the third and fourth quarter because of the fact that that CDC contract is a third party logistics contract where we don’t show the full revenues of the product. But as we get there we’ll call that effect out for you as much as we can estimate it.
Richard Close - Jefferies & Co.:  Any reason why operating margin in Technology Solutions would decrease as we progress through this year?
Jeff Campbell: Well there’s also quarterly volatility. There so we’ve talked for a long time about a long term goal of having that operating margin in the low to mid teens, which means 13%. Our expectation for the full year this year is while we’ll get close to that 13% we probably won’t quite get into it.
John Hammergren: And operator I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: Your last question comes from Lawrence Marsh - Barclays Capital.
Lawrence Marsh - Barclays Capital: Just a quick clarification for Jeff to make sure we’re all on the same page here. Last quarter you said maybe $0.06 or $0.07 benefit from better distribution momentum. In this quarter you guys are saying $0.20 from momentum and flu. So is it too simplistic to just split that in half with knowing all the caveats of that of flu? And then can we just split you know flu in half, say $0.05 from H1N1 and $0.05 from overall flu volumes, just based on your best case? Or am I off there?
Jeff Campbell: It is variable but I suppose as a starting point yes, Larry. But remember the $0.20 is on top of what happened last quarter and half the $0.20 we said was probably, I didn’t say this but sort of a big piece of its flu and a big piece of it is the non-flu momentum of the business. So if for now you wanted to go $0.10 and $0.10 that’s not an unreasonable assumption.
Lawrence Marsh - Barclays Capital:  And then I guess just execution. John, I know you’re a big advocate of executing in your businesses. One of the catalyst for changes in technology was some frustration there. I know last quarter you talked about Pat you know having a lot of individual business leaders but is there any evidence from where you sit that there’s you know any crisper execution under Pat and his team? Or are we still way off to determine that?
John Hammergren: Clearly Larry it’s early. I think Pat’s been in his role for three months. And we also as I talked about on the last call created a Chief Technology Officer role and added it to the role of Randy Spratt as our Information Officer. I would say that there is growing evidence of not only the fact that we’re very well positioned in our product portfolios and well positioned to take advantage of this new sort of electronification of healthcare through our solutions sets but there’s also early indication that the team is responding well to a renewed focus on execution and a renewed focus on customer satisfaction. We’ve invested heavily against those two parties. I would say that in addition to the CTO role, Pat and his team have put together a client service group that focused on successful implementation and getting the value. So beyond just selling the product and saying good luck, we are going to assist our customers in actually realizing the dreams that they had at the time they initiated the contracts with us to begin with, which goes much further than we have in the past. And I would also say that our most recent experience bringing our Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management product to a general availability status went to a very rigorous amount of effort with the teams inside of MTS as well as the CTO organization to have an aligned view on the fact that the product was ready to go to market, so that our customers wouldn’t have to deal with problems with the software after we began the implementation. So we’re very confident that we’re beginning to make those steps and that the organization is responding well, albeit we’re early into this stage. So thank you, Larry, and thank you all for your questions today. And thank you operator. I really am pleased with our second quarter performance. I’m really excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. I think that as Jeff mentioned we’re not only doing a great job of executing in a heads down way to manage costs and control spending, we’re also continuing to innovate. And that simultaneous execution and innovation is the secret sauce of success. And I think our organization has a proven ability to do those things simultaneously. So I’m going to hand it off to Ana and she’ll describe what we’re going to do in terms of upcoming events. Ana?
Ana Schrank:  Thanks John. I have a preview of upcoming events for the financial community. On November 12 we will present at the Credit Suisse Healthcare Conference in Phoenix. On November 18 we will present at the Lazard Capital Markets Conference in New York. And on January 11 we will present at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. We plan to release third quarter earnings results in late January. We look forward to seeing you at one of these upcoming events. Thank you and good bye.
Operator: That does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

(Operator instructions) Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. And I'd now like to introduce Ms. Ana Schrank, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am.
Ana Schrank: Thank you, Melanie. Good afternoon and welcome to the McKesson fiscal 2010 First Quarter Earnings Call. With me today are John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO and Jeff Campbell, our CFO. John will first provide a business update and we'll then introduce Jeff who will review the financial results for the quarter, after Jeff's comments we'll open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 6:00 Eastern Time. Before we begin I'll remind listeners that during the course of this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Thanks and here is John Hammergren.
John Hammergren: Thanks, Ana, and thanks everyone for joining us on our call. Today we have reported a strong start to fiscal 2010. For the first quarter we achieved total company revenues of $26.7 billion and fully diluted earnings per share of $1.06. Our strong earnings for the first quarter was driven by our ability to achieve operating leverage in both segments. In the distribution solution segment operating profit was up 12% and in the technology solution segment operating profit was up 56%. I'm very pleased that across the organization we maintained a disciplined focus on expense management to help drive significant operating margin improvement. Before I turn the call over to Jeff for a detailed review of our financial results I'll highlight the trends in our business and the progress we are making to deliver sustained growth. Distribution Solutions performed extremely well in the first quarter, with solid performances in all of our businesses. As we mentioned during our fourth quarter earnings call we lost two customer buying groups, one in the institutional segment and the other in the retail independent segment which will impact revenues for the full fiscal year. We also forecasted pressure on our sell margin in fiscal 2010. As expected our sell margin did decline in the first quarter but we were able to somewhat offset it with disciplined expense management. In addition to the headcount reductions and cost initiatives we implemented late last year, we've put in motion other changes to our cost structure in the first quarter including the salary freeze for management, renegotiated terms with certain vendors and further cuts to discretionary spending. Therefore, operating expenses were down for the quarter and will be tightly controlled for the remainder of the year. Besides the cost control initiatives, in the first quarter we have a strong contribution from our arrangements with the branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. Although it is early in the year our compensation of these agreements is trending positively. We continue to have excellent performance with our generics program, where we also use our scale and experience to negotiate great savings for our customers which results in good margin expansion for our business. Our success with our generics results were the three primary drivers, retention and penetration of our customer base, increasing compliance with our customers to ensure their generic purchases are from McKesson and not alternative suppliers and a steady pace of generic launches. Despite the linear launch schedule expected this year, and the loss of the two customers buying groups I mentioned earlier we anticipate continued profit growth in generics for fiscal 2010. Sales for our proprietary generics program, One Stop, grew 19% this quarter. Our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues include not only our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution business but also our specialty distribution business and our pharmacy automation business. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call we had solid performance in each of these, so I want to spend a few moments highlighting their contribution to the overall performance of our distribution segment. Specialty Care Solutions delivered specialty pharmaceutical products to the clinical channels has a clear number two position in this rapidly growing segment of the market. Now that we have fully integrated oncology therapeutics network we have a heightened focus on improving our customers experience and building out our value proposition by leveraging our technology and clinical assets. We have our link technology deployed in almost all of our community oncology practices. Link is a charge capture capability, inventory management and reporting tools. It can also include a web-based electronic medical record built specifically for oncology and other specific specialty practices. It helps physicians automate the treatment plan and coordinate care with other providers. We believe our Specialty Care Solutions portfolio of offering is a key differentiator and is becoming increasingly relevant to the success of providers. Our pharmacy automation business which is known as McKesson Pharmacy Systems supplies pharmacy management software and automated dispensing solutions to retail, mail order and central fill pharmacies. It is a significant player in the retail pharmacy market and is closing in on our overall number one position with approximately 11,000 sites live or under contract. McKesson's Pharmacy Systems is enjoying excellent market momentum for its next generation pharmacy management solution called Enterprise RX. As the industry's first software as a service system, it enables chains to benefit from the centralization of pharmacy operations. Earlier this year, we announced the Safeway would deploy Enterprise RX to all of its U.S. based pharmacy. Once fully deployed it will make McKesson the number one provider of pharmacy systems through the chain market. In addition to its leading position in the chain space McKesson Pharmacy Systems also plays a critical role in providing retail operating systems to many of our independent customers, benefiting the customers in a number of ways. Most notably the systems fully integrated work flow which was designed by pharmacists, significantly reduces the incidence of prescription errors. This is just one example of the many products and solutions we have for our independent pharmacy. Another example is our Health Mart franchise, which continues to enjoy considerable growth in store count. Health Mart levels the playing field for independent pharmacies by providing the resources and national strength they need to be successful in today's increasingly competitive marketplace. Health Mart includes consumer branding and advertising. Managed Care network that holds more than 9,000 plans with 54 pharmacy benefit managers, and programs that help pharmacists partner more effectively with industry associations and policy makers. Turning to our other businesses and distribution solutions. Our medical surgical business, which has a leading position in the alternative site market benefited in the first quarter from the demanding I should say from the demand resulting from the H1N1 virus. We continue to expect top line in this segment will be somewhat impacted by the recession through the remainder of the fiscal year but we are diligently managing operating expenses to offset revenue softness. We are also focused on optimizing our sourcing at McKesson branded products to successfully position this business for an economic rebound. As expected we had a solid performance in our Canadian distribution business, as the pharmaceutical market there is slightly stronger than in the United States. All of our programs or solutions available to U.S. pharmaceutical customers are also available to our customers in Canada and it clearly differentiates the value of our offering. I'm extremely pleased with the first quarter performance in distribution solutions. We came into the year with modest revenue expectations and facing sell-side margin pressure but through strong cost containment activities, we continued success of our generics program, solid branded pharmaceutical relationships and an increase in demand related to the H1N1 virus as well as favorable operating trends in our Canadian business we were able to achieve a terrific start to the year. Turning now to Technology Solutions. I want to start by spending a moment talking about Pat Blake, whom I recently promoted to lead the technology solution segment. Pat's entire career has been in healthcare. The last 13 years have been with McKesson in leadership roles both in U.S. pharmaceutical and more recently in the specialty care solutions business where he lead our acquisition and integration of oncology therapeutics network. Pat has an outstanding track record as a business leader and is very customer focused. He knows the operational, clinical and financial challenges that face healthcare organizations today and appreciates the role information technology can play to help them improve their performance. Two weeks ago, Pat and Palmi Samuel, President of our Provider Technologies business along with other senior McKesson executives lead our Annual Executive Leadership Summit here in San Francisco. This year summit targeted CEOs and focused on public policy issues including the stimulus IT incentives. The summit drew more than 60 attendees from our hospital, health system and physician customers across the country. It followed seven regional CEO strategic forums that were conducted over the past six months including a forum in Washington D.C. with thought leaders and federal policy makers. During the summit I had the opportunity to speak with many of the CEOs about their views on what is happening in Washington. They are watching the progress on healthcare reform and are excited about the prospect of stimulus money becoming available for healthcare IT. However, they are concerned about the potential changes in reimbursement models in how to create more integration with physicians in their communities. For all of us involved the summit reinforced the urgency of the planning process. Reform is eminent and significant change is on the horizon. Providers need a partner they can count on McKesson is that partner. Our strategy remains the same. We want to help providers reduce cost while improving quality, safety and efficiency through automation and connectivity. Ultimately the system needs to engage the patient as a consumer so we are all collaborating to achieve a common objective, care that patient centers, economically sustainable, high quality, safe, efficient and connected. McKesson has a comprehensive set of products and services to achieve this goal. While the economy continues to affect provider purchasing, the stimulus is creating new energy in our customer base, with particularly strong interest in our clinical offering. Overall, interest in our solutions is at an all-time high and the pipeline is very strong. More than 50% of our health systems customers have completed their stimulus readiness assessment or are in the process of doing so and we are engaging them in the implementation planning. We expect this interest will lead to increased contracting activity as this fiscal year progresses and on into Fiscal 2011. However we continue to believe the stimulus related buying will not impact our bottom line in significant amounts in fiscal 2010. This recession has had an impact on software and hardware purchases, but the segments diverse portfolio and the fact that much of our revenue comes from predictable recurring streams has helped to mitigate the impact of the economy. A number of our solutions require little capital investment by the customer such as our RelayHealth Connectivity business or our Revenue Cycle Outsourcing business and the subscription revenues we receive from our payer customers. Additionally with the largest base in the industry we have stable revenues from maintenance on our installed solutions. I'm pleased with the first quarter performance of Technology Solutions, particularly with the strong contribution from the cost containment measures we implemented beginning last fiscal year which helped us to offset flat revenues and achieve operating margin expansion. The last few months I've spent more time focused on Technology Solutions and I've become even more convinced that we have the right team in place and an impressive set of products and solutions for our customers. I'm confident we are well positioned to extend our lead in healthcare information technology. In summary, this is a terrific start to fiscal 2010. The cost control measures we implemented beginning last year had better than expected results. Compensation from our branded pharmaceutical agreements is trending well and we had excellent growth in generics despite recent customer losses. We are encouraged by the level of interest among our customers and Technology Solutions driven by the stimulus and we expect this will lead to contracting activity as the fiscal year progresses. Several of our businesses experienced an increase in demand from the H1N1 virus including U.S. Pharmaceuticals, medical surgical, and our payer business, where inbound calls to our nurse triage centers increased during the quarter. Even fuel prices came in below our expectations. And strong cash flow generation early in the year coupled with improved stability in the financial market gave us comfort and an early start on our stock repurchases. Across all of our businesses we executed on opportunities to control expenses and increase profitability giving us positive momentum for the remainder of the fiscal year. Because of this momentum we are raising our full year expectations and now expect earnings per diluted share of $4.15 to $4.30 for fiscal 2010. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff and will return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?
Jeff Campbell: Well thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As you just heard McKesson had an excellent start to the fiscal tear on the bottom line driven by effective cost controls and overall solid performances across the entire organization. Many things went right. We are pleased with our ability to get leverage to grow our earnings in this environment. As usual I'll begin by discussing our consolidated results and I'll provide additional color as I discuss each segment in more detail. Revenues for the quarter were flat at $26.7 billion. I'd remind you of our assumptions for full year revenues which called for modest growth for the economy and the financial markets to show a modest uptick towards the end of our fiscal 2010. These assumptions still apply. So, on flat revenues for the quarter it was critical for us to get leverage. We did. Our gross profit for the quarter was up 3% to $1.3 billion, both segments contributed to this leverage with both achieving nice gross profit margins and expansion. Moving below the gross profit line, our total operating expenses for the quarter were down 6% to $844 million. These lower operating expenses were the key driver of our strong earnings this quarter. The lower expenses were primarily driven by the cost containment effort we put in place beginning last year in response to the difficult economic environment. Our operating expenses also benefited from the stronger dollar as well as a legal settlement impacting the company's 401-K plan which I'll come back to later in my remarks. Operating income for the quarter grew 24% to $459 million, $371 million a year ago. Moving below operating income, other income of $10 million or 52% below last year and primarily due to lower interest income resulting from lower prevailing interest rates. Interest expense for the quarter of $48 million increase due to the $700 million debt we issued in February. Moving to taxes. our effective tax rate of 31.6% is roughly in line with the 32% run rate we expect for the full year and was lower than the 34.4% effective tax rate in the first quarter a year ago. Net income in the quarter grew 23% to $188 million, $235 million in the prior year while earnings per share of $1.06 was up 28% from $0.83 a year ago. This leverage at the EPS line relative to net income was due to the cumulative impact of our share repurchases which lowered our diluted weighted average shares outstanding by 4% year-over-year to 272 million. Let's now move on to Distribution Solutions. In this segment, revenue growth overall was flat compared to the same quarter last year. U.S. direct distribution and services revenues were 4% primarily due to market growth rates partially offset by the losses in fiscal 2009 of several customers that we have previously discussed. Our direct revenues also benefited from a large customer shifting warehouse purchases to direct store delivery. This mix shift by the large customer was also the primary driver of the 9% decline in our sales to customer warehouse. We are pleased with the growth in the Canadian business. On a constant currency basis revenues grew 10% driven by market growth rates and expanded distribution agreements. That said Canadian U.S. dollar revenues were affected by an unfavorable currency impact of 15% for the quarter. As I said in the past we are fairly hedged to the Canadian Dollar on a consolidated operating profit basis given our large IT workforce in Canada. Medical surgical distribution revenues were up 9% for the quarter to $685 million growing roughly at market rate after considering the effect of some small acquisitions we made in fiscal 2009 and the impact of the H1N1 virus. Gross profit for the segment was up 2% to $954 million from $934 million a year ago on flat revenues representing a nice improvement in gross margin of eight basis points. Several factors contributed to the increase in gross profit for the quarter. First, the volume and timing of when we receive compensation under our agreements of branded manufacturer showed solid improvement year-over-year. Next, we saw a better mix of higher margin products services including sales in One Stop generics and sales related to the H1N1 virus. We also benefited from the lower mix of warehouse sales. Consistent with what we indicated during our last earnings call, but only partially offsetting these positives this quarter was a decline in the sell-side margin. Our Distribution Solutions operating expenses were down 6% for the quarter to $531 million reflecting our continued focus on containing costs and a favorable foreign exchange rate impact resulting from a weaker Canadian Dollar. Operating margin rates for the quarter was 166 basis points compared to 148 basis points in the prior year. In summary and before I move on to Technology Solutions, we are very pleased with the operating margin expansion of our business in the Distribution Solutions driven by the stronger than expected gross margin performance and sound expense management. We are off to a great start to fiscal 2010 in this segment. In Technology Solutions, total revenues were flat for the quarter $743 million. Services revenues were up 4% in the quarter to $589 million reflecting more stable nature of the revenues. Software and software systems revenues of 130 million and hardware revenues of $24 million in the quarter were down in the prior year primarily due to lower booking of new technology purchases in our third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 in the hospital and physician office sectors. On the flat revenues, Technology Solutions reported gross margin expansion, a bit over 200 basis points with gross profit for the segment up 4% to $349 million. I would remind you that our first quarter gross margin a year ago was off our historical trend line while this year's gross margin is more in line with our usual performance. Technology Solutions operating expenses decreased 9% in the quarter to $247 million. These lower expenses are primarily due to lower employee compensation costs as well as broader cost containment efforts across the segment in response to the economic slowdown. We do continue to innovate and spend in R&D to maintain our leadership position. For the quarter Technology Solutions that totaled gross R&D spending of $97 million which is roughly flat relative to the prior year. Of this amount we capitalized 18% compared to 14% a year ago. Our operating profit in our Technology Solutions segment this quarter was $103 million, up 56% from the $66 million we reported a year ago. Operating margin in this segment was up to 13.86% for the quarter compared to 8.87% in the prior year. While we are pleased with this margin expansion, I will remind you of the margin volatility that is common in Technology Solutions quarterly results and that the prior year results were off the historical trend line. Leaving our segment performance and turning briefly to the balance sheet and our working capital metrics. Our receivables were $7.5 million which is unchanged from the prior year after adjusting for the $325 million utilization of our AR sales facility in the first quarter of last year. Days sales outstanding was 23 days, up slightly versus the prior year, but down of the 24 days we posted at the end of last quarter. As a result of our conscious decision to reduce inventory levels like last year, our day sales in inventory of 31 days and day sales payables of 43 days decreased two days and one day respectively compared to a year ago. Our inventories were $8.6 billion on June 30, a 8% decrease over last year while our payables declined 2% to $12.2 billion from a year ago. Importantly, both DSI and DSP metrics showed a modest improvement from what we posted at the end of last quarter. We are pleased with this improvement in all our working capital metrics this quarter. Considering the current environment we have been particularly focused on cash. These working capital improvements resulted in McKesson generating $907 million in operating cash flow in the first quarter. Going forward, we continue to expect to generate approximately $1.5 billion of operating cash in fiscal 2010 excluding the AWP payment that we expect to make this quarter, but we are clearly off to a strong start. As a result of this strong cash flow generation as well as our view that the financial markets continue to show improvement, we repurchased $275 million worth of shares in the quarter. Our share repurchases in the first quarter were accelerated from the pace we expected for our full year diluted outstanding share guidance. We would now expect our full year to come in a bit below the original guidance we provided of 272 million shares. Property acquisitions were $42 million for the quarter reflecting our continued investments in our internal systems and distribution center network, capitalized software expenditures of $36 million, a year ago to $44 million and our annual guidance for capital and software expenditures in the range of $350 million to $400 million remains unchanged. During the quarter we increased our accounts receivable sales facility commitment from $1 billion to $1.1 billion under terms similar to those previously. And we ended the quarter with $2.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents, up from 2.1 billion we held at year-end. So, to now conclude, as John mentioned earlier we are raising our guidance on diluted EPS from continuing operations from $3.90 to $4.05 to a new range of $4.15 to $4.30. Let me take a moment and walk you through the increase to our new EPS guidance range. There are two drivers of this guidance change. $0.15 from a positive legal settlement impacting our 401(k) and $0.10 from our overall confidence based on the strong start to the year this quarter represents. So let me first review the legal settlement impacting the company's 401(k) plan that I mentioned earlier and let me start with some background. Historically, the company has made voluntary contributions to its profit-sharing investment plan or 401(k) plan. These contributions generally came from a 1980 employee stock ownership plan. This ESOP contributed to the 401 (k) plan some relatively inexpensive shares, but began to run out of shares in fiscal 2008. As a result our 401 (k) expense increased from $13 million in fiscal 2008 to $53 million in fiscal 2009 and we originally expected approximately $60 million in fiscal 2010. Now returning to the legal settlement as mentioned in our earnings release, our PSIP expects to receive settlement proceeds that will allow it to fund the company's 401(k) plan this year. Therefore, relative to our original guidance, we expect a favorable diluted EPS impact of approximately $0.15 due to the reduction in fiscal 2010 401(k) related expense. Four of the $0.15 impacted our June quarter. So that's the $0.15. The other $0.10 increase in our guidance range comes from our overall confidence based on the strong start to the year. One way to think about this $0.10 is that our strong cash start should add $0.03 to $0.04 diluted EPS upside due to our accelerated share repurchases and the resulting benefit of lower expected diluted shares outstanding. The remaining $0.06 to $0.07 of EPS upside stems from the favorable trends that impacted our Distribution Solutions segment in our first quarter. These include better than expected results from the cost control measures we implemented last year, higher compensation from our agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers, excellent growth in generics despite recent customer losses and increased demand related to the H1N1 virus. One implication of these two drivers of our guidance changes is around our operating margin expectations. We commented last quarter that our expectation for the year was for the Distribution Solutions operating margin to be flat to up a couple of basis points. Based on the changes I just discussed we would now expect Distribution Solutions operating margin to be a bit better. And for our Technology Solutions businesses, despite the flat revenues in our first quarter, we continue to expect our cost control efforts, which should allow us to achieve operating margin expansion for the full year. Looking forward to our quarterly progression, positive trends that helped drive our first quarter results still appear to be mostly in place. And we expect that this momentum will carry into our September quarter, so the September quarter should be stronger than we expected in our original guidance. This is very early in our fiscal year to raise guidance. We don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves. The overall environment still is quite a bit of uncertainty, including the healthcare reform debate, volatile economy and an improving far from stable financial market, but if the positive trends continue for the remainder of the year, we would expect to be at the top end of our new rate. We will provide any further updates guidance only when we have the visibility to do so. In closing we are pleased with the performance across all businesses and feel that McKesson is off to a solid start this year. Thanks. With that I'll turn the call over to the Operator for your questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Our first question come from Charles Rhyee, your line is open.
Jeff Campbell: Charles?
Operator: I apologize. It looks like Charles just disconnected. Our next question comes from Lisa Gill. Your line is open.
Lisa Gill – JPMorgan: Hi, thanks very much and congratulations on the great quarter. Just had a couple of questions. On the shift from warehouse to direct store, can you maybe talk about the margin impact and is that some of what's playing into the operating margins, Jeff, as you look forward? And then secondly, as we think about generics, can you maybe give us an indication of what One Stop generics look like excluding the losses? I mean was it up substantially if you excluded the business that you lost?
Jeff Campbell: Well, on the warehouse shift, Lisa, as you know in our 10-K we talk about the fact that our warehouse sales have a significantly lower gross margin generally in the 50 basis points so it's a positive to our gross margin to have a shift from warehouse to direct. Now, of course, there's lots of other things going on this quarter with the strong performance on the branded manufacturer side, a great generics quarter and then the fact that because of some things that happened last year, we had a sell margin decline so those are all impacting what you see on the gross margin this quarter.
Lisa Gill – JPMorgan: And then what about on the generics side? If you were to exclude the loss of that business are you seeing your generic program grow substantially faster than the 19% you talked about?
John Hammergren: Yeah, Lisa, this is John. We did obviously have some impact particularly from the loss of the independent buying group that was more compliant with generics than other customers might normally be. So substantially better probably would be an exaggeration but it would have been better had we not lost those customers at the end of last year so we're really pleased with the performance and frankly, the continued success of our generic program as Jeff mentioned was one of the fuels to what was an outstanding quarter.
Lisa Gill – JPMorgan: And then, just one last follow-up. John, when you talked about the trends in IT, I think you talked about no impact for fiscal 2010, but you are starting to see contracting activity. Are those things you're can give us updates on as we move throughout the Fall, would you anticipate that hospitals will start making buying decisions as we move throughout the Fall and then it will be impactful to your 2011 fiscal year?
John Hammergren: Well, we in the past have used other metrics, we talked about bookings at one point in our past and we used a long time ago, our predecessors used to talk a little bit about funnels so I'm a little reluctant to go back to those things but I would say that we are seeing increased activity both from an interest perspective and from a contracting perspective. However, as you know the way we are reporting our financials, it really rolls into our results when we actually get customers live and successful so I would say that we are continuing to see interest and activity and we are optimistic that 2011 will be a good year for us in the technology business and we'll gain strength throughout this year and we should be able to continue to provide color as the year goes along and if we get any significant contracts of merit we may chat with you about them, but it's usually a lot of small things that add up to a successful feeling about 2011.
Operator: Our next question will come from Charles Rhyee. Your line is now open.
Charles Rhyee – Oppenheimer Co., Inc: Oh, thanks. Can you guys hear me?
John Hammergren: Yes, Charles.
Charles Rhyee – Oppenheimer Co., Inc: Okay, sorry, I had to dial myself back in there. I don't know if you talked on this already, Jeff, but just wanted to go back to the guidance real quick. Other than if we think about the $0.15 that's being funded is it fair to think that we wouldn't expect that for next fiscal year in fiscal 11?
Jeff Campbell: Yeah.
Charles Rhyee – Oppenheimer Co., Inc: Okay so it's sort of just we're getting the benefit this year because the settlement, you talked earlier about this 1980 ESOP program was running on shares, can you talk about the new plan that's in place and how well funded that is in terms of stock available for that and is it something that we should think that could happen again in the future?
Jeff Campbell: Well, the short answer to that is no, it won't happen again in the future, so this ESOP which was set up in the 1980s and funded with a bunch of shares back in the 1980s has been able to fund the company's 401(k) match but most of the last several decades you've seen a little gyration as I talked about in my script up and down as we got towards the end of that ESOP twice. this is clearly the end of its life this year, meaning going forward the Company will be making cash contributions and that run rate let's use a round number of $60 million a year is what you'll see starting next year.
John Hammergren: But you're correct Charles, that this conversation today was talking about the one-time event of the cash infusion coming from the settlement that offsets the company's normal requirement to make that $60 million contribution.
Operator: Our next question come from Glen Santangelo, your line is open.
Glen Santangelo – Credit Suisse-North America: Yeah, John and Jeff, thanks and good afternoon. I just wanted to follow-up with you, Jeff, regarding the guidance going forward. You typically gave us some things to think about when it comes to quarterly progression because if I look at your estimates now you basically raised on a fundamental basis by $0.10 but yet you basically beat this quarter by a fair amount more than that relative to at least what the street was expecting so kind of tells me that maybe at least the quarterly progression of what's out there on the street seems to be a little bit off and I was kind of curious as you look out over the next three fiscal quarters remaining in the year, is there something or anything big that we should be kind of thinking about, for example, when the timing of additional manufacture compensation might hit or the Pfizer fee-for-service agreement, that's coming online in January, any of those types of things to help us button down our quarterly progression I think would be helpful?
Jeff Campbell: Yeah, I think, Glen, to keep it fairly simple, we're only 90 days into our fiscal tear. Certainly it has not been our practice to raise guidance after just one quarter. We're still in a very uncertain economy so we are trying to balance all that uncertainty with the fact that we had a very strong first quarter. As I said in my remarks, it's July 28th so we're 28 days into the next quarter and right now, the things that made June real strong look like they are going to make September real strong, so relative to the directional guidance I gave 90 days ago I would expect a significantly stronger September quarter. Beyond that, boy, when you get to the back half of our year it's just too early for us to really make a lot of comments or to feel completely confident in reading our guidance to that part of the year.
Glen Santangelo – Credit Suisse-North America: Okay, fair enough and John, maybe if I could just ask one other question on the healthcare IT business. Sounds like you had a fair amount of meetings with some of your bigger clients. Could you maybe just give us a sense for where they're at in the process in terms of understanding the definition of meaningful use? Do you think the hospital CEOs you guys deal with are, are they trying to figure it out at this point or do you think they're kind of past that stage and where do you see the opportunity? Is it more in the software side or more in the professional services and consulting side of the business?
John Hammergren: Those are good questions. I think that the customers, all of them I would say are trying to figure this out and clearly we can make some estimates as to what criteria will be required and the products are going to implement and what meaningful use is actually going to mean but right now they're all guesses as these things haven't been fully defined, but we have a reasonable appreciation for where we might be headed so, as you might imagine we've been working with these customers to make sure that they're making progress towards these objectives and there are different levels of implementations that have already taken place or are under way, so we're trying to encourage our customers to start now if they haven't already started and to continue if they have started and not only in the planning phase but also the implementation phases, so I think without exception, Glen, it appears to me that our customers want to meet the requirements and it's a question of how are they going to fund these things short-term, what do they want to install first and second and third and where do they stand today in sort of a diagnostic way. As to what they're going to buy, I think it's going to be obviously up to each customer but we think they are going to require not only software but also implementation support and services. Some of them are going to ask us to host these items for them and help them manage their data centers, they will have to be connected to other constituents in the system, we believe, and clearly, there's already a connection requirement for the health plan and to make things simpler and more efficient clearly doctors and other healthcare organizations are going to want to be connected so I think there's a really across the board opportunity for us to help our customers with these challenges. I just have to point out though this is a complex thing and it's going to take us to get these people up and running where they need to be up and running is going to take us into 2011 and as you might know also from the legislation, the government is not even expecting them to be in meaningful use until out so, that's really what they're focused on is what do I need to do to make it across the finish line in the most robust way.
Operator: Our next question will come from Larry Marsh, your line is open.
Larry Marsh – Barclays Capital: Thanks. Good afternoon. Couple of quick things. First, let me extend congratulations to Pat on his new role. I'm sure he will do a great job. Let me reconcile if you could, John, I know part of the catalyst for your changing leadership was a feeling of drift and concerns about time to market I think today you had communicated you felt like you have the right team in place to extend the lead in that business. Can you reconcile those two statements and when would you think you'd be in a position where you and Pat would be more specific in terms of where you want to take that business from here?
John Hammergren: Well as I mentioned before one of the keys to this business is to get revenue growth and to help our customers get these implementations live and to make them successful. I do think Pat is the right person for this task, but as I also mentioned there are actually five businesses inside MTS, all of which have leadership in place including MPT which is the focus of a lot of the stimulus money which was lead by Palmisano Samuel. So although we made some changes in Palmi's organization in certain areas we do think we have a good team and we have a good strategy in place, it should be successful and we're now investing more heavily frankly in our ability to help our customers be successful and to assist in the implementation process with our products and to make sure that it's more than just buying the software it's actually getting physician adoption, for example, and so I think there are some things we can do to improve the relationship our customers have with us and their success implementing our products with many constituents, not the least of which are the physicians. I think I would not anticipate major strategic changes in the business with the change in addition of Pat to the team. Pat and I have spent not only 13 years here together working together, but we work these businesses together as a collaborative team. All of our Presidents are involved in our quarterly reviews and our strategy reviews. He has a good familiarity with the business and people in the business and it's not as if he has to start from ground zero to get familiar with it so I think there are some things we can do that will help us from an execution perspective. You can see we've already made some changes to align our cost in a way that I think will help improve our ability to get to our target margins and so I'm excited about where we're headed but the key in the business is customer success which will lead to revenue for our Company.
Larry Marsh – Barclays Capital: Okay, great. And just a follow-up if I could, the compensation agreements with the manufacturers you mentioned being a bit ahead of plan in this fee based world it seems like some of that's going to be driven by volume, is your message today that your performance against some of those metrics is allowing you to overachieve on some of these compensation agreements or is there something from the manufacturers that are causing them to be more generous in the channel given this environment?
Jeff Campbell: I think that the manufacturers as a composite across all of our businesses, clearly are interested in increasing their relationship with us and further penetrating the channel through our sales organization, so our med surge business has gotten a very good relationship with the manufacturers and obviously all of our businesses are focused on doing a good job for the manufacturing partners and I mentioned the strength with generics. Specific to the branded manufacturers in our pharmaceutical business our agreements are well structured. I do think they are long term and we've performed against them over the long term and I think we'll continue to, so I think the strength in our business has been or the strengthen the performance of these agreements is related to not only our execution under the agreement but just frankly the markets in which the branded manufacturers continue to use prices as one of the vehicles to attain their objectives and then we maximize our performance on to the agreement.
Larry Marsh – Barclays Capital: Okay. Very good, just a quick clarification. I know the original guidance was such that management comp would only get paid out at like 50% of target. I think you had said you were disappointed at the original guidance. Is the new guidance point where you feel like if it attained management compensation would be triggered at the 100% rate or you are not commenting?
John Hammergren: Well we typically don't talk in detail about our compensation plans. Clearly the more we overachieve our original guidance more likely we are to move up in those compensation figures but this is all self-funded and we have to overachieve by enough to continue to fund the plans that we have in place. We have over 10,000 bonus eligible employees in our Company so people are keenly aware of the fact the plan we put in place was something we were not excited about and the management team was not only going to take huge measures to take costs out of the business, but also on a personal level not have a salary increase and we were going to also participate in a bonus reduction at least at those planned levels. So I think the encouraging news here is that we look like we are going to exceed the original expectations that we set forth and if we continue to perform the way that I expect we will, then our ability to achieve above those lower levels of bonus will be available to us, but I think the most important thing that our employees are focused on is making sure that we're delivering for our customers and that we hit the objectives that we tell our owners in the Company that we're going to hit and both those factors are very important.
Operator: Our next question will come from Robert Willoughby, your line is open.
Robert Willoughby – BAS-ML: Jeff or John, given some of the moving parts can you hairs to guess what the direct distribution business actually grew adjusted for some of the loss contracts and shift in warehouse sales?
Jeff Campbell: There's always a little bit of guess work even when we look at the numbers but our best estimate if you take out the ins and outs it's probably around 2% to 3% which is pretty consistent actually with our general guidance for the year of the overall revenues.
Robert Willoughby – BAS-ML: That's great. Thank you.
Jeff Campbell: Welcome.
Operator: Our next question will come from Tom Gallucci, your line is open.
Tom Gallucci – Lazard Capital Markets: Good afternoon. Thanks. Just a couple of quick ones hopefully. The shift from warehouse to direct is that a permanent shift or some sort of change in relationship with the customer or is that just a unique buying pattern for the quarter?
John Hammergren: This is a respect of circumstances, it's a permanent shift with a customer and it was part of the continued ability for us to add value in the relationship.
Tom Gallucci – Lazard Capital Markets: Okay. And then in the IT business, maybe can you detail a little bit where some of the cost savings have been and I guess what I'm getting at there is some of the things you described John, there, having to get to the market a little faster and being able to help the customers in an array of areas, I guess if you expect an increase in sales over time based on the increased activity you've seen is there a quarter that we should be thinking about maybe you'll have to start to ramp up some expenses as opposed to having cut over the last year?
John Hammergren: That's a good question. We did make some cuts last year in many areas, but I'd also say we made some investments in many areas. It was really an opportunity for us to focus the business on those key priorities that are important as we get to particularly the stimulus spending as well as our as you know we've been developing another financial product line, so those investments are important to us and we really made I think very careful moves not to impact those key priorities. As you know though, when we start helping our customers implement software we need people on the ground that know what they're doing and there is going to be sort of an advanced training and implementation phase of our hiring and getting people skilled before we put them in front of our customers. So as we said we think these implementations will begin to ramp up as we get to the end of this year and into next year, that's how we realize the revenue next year, and that will require us to have some investment in the back half of this year. I don't think it's significant in terms of the overall cooperation and because we have done a good job at controlling expenses thus far, I think our guidance contains the investment that we think is necessary
Tom Gallucci – Lazard Capital Markets: Okay. And just finally, on the cash usage, pretty aggressive on the buyback this quarter. $500 million or so left. How should we think about longer term cash deployment, Jeff? Thank you.
Jeff Campbell: Well, I think, Tom, we would just stand by our usual comment that we take a portfolio approach. We're always looking for acquisitions at reasonable prices, when they are not around we do a little bit more share repurchase and probably do a little bit more share repurchase than we've intended originally at the June quarter given the unusually strong start to cash as well as the general comfort level we have in the financial markets, but these are decisions we make on a real time basis that we'll look at all of the alternatives we have in the September quarter and make the decisions accordingly.
Operator: Our next question will come from Charles Boorady, your line is open.
Charles Boorady – Citigroup: Hi, thanks. Most of them have been answered but I just wanted to ask for a little bit more elaboration on the tech solution business in terms of just more details on the expense management initiatives and I'm trying to reconcile that with the growing backlog, the increase in demand which generally associate with making investments and bringing new people on to prepare for that coming demand, and so hearing about you mentioned salary freezes, discretionary spending cuts, and I'm wondering if you could just elaborate on them specifically, are there certain areas that you're cutting but other areas you're investing in because those don't sound like the kind of things you do if you're anticipating a strong growth in backlog.
Jeff Campbell: Well, I think those are good questions. We do anticipate a growth in the backlog and more implementation as we go into the year so I think the key is not to cut customer facing activity, not to affect the ability to deliver the software and get it operational. Clearly, it's a very large organization with lots of head counts and lots of payroll and lots of bonus eligible employees and lots of salary increases that didn't occur so that gives you a certain amount of ability to continue to invest in those key priorities when you are not inflating your salaries across-the-board by 4% or 5% so I think that we believe the business is being properly funded. The key here is not to have a lot of people hanging around with no work and on the other hand the key is to have the people available when you have the implementation ready to go, so it is a bit of a balancing act, but we think we have good transparency and that was one of the critical things that I've said in my prepared remarks which is we've been working with our customers and over 50% of them now have some kind of a plan we're trying to develop, it kind of road maps them to stimulus readiness and over time then we'll get a much better visibility and idea of what they're going to need from a resource perspective to bring their own sites live, so critical R&D investments are continuing to be made. The key product investments are being made and key people investments are being made relative to these areas.
Charles Boorady – Citigroup: Are some of these decisions related to integration of previous acquisitions or other things that might have been done previously and so while they're contemporaneous with the build pre-stimulus is it fair to separate these cost cuts from anything related to preparing for the growing demand?
Jeff Campbell: Well, I think we have had a history in this business at making acquisitions and those acquisitions would have certain one-time costs and things associated with them and certainly some drag in the early years but I think the key here was just really careful analysis of what resources we needed as we came into an environment where there was going to be slowed buying and that slowed buying continues through the third and fourth quarters of last year and frankly we're still in the process of getting customers back into the cycle of signing their names and writing checks so although we're optimistic we're cautiously optimistic on the remainder of this year, we think that 2011 is stacking up to be a very good year from a revenue perspective, certainly on a relative basis for this year.
Charles Boorady – Citigroup: Thank you.
Jeff Campbell: Yes.
Operator: Our next question will come from Eric Coldwell, your line is open.
Eric Coldwell – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Thanks. Just a couple of quick ones. First, can we get the LIFO adjustment for the quarter, I guess the nominal amount as well as the year to year comp? Number two, in price inflation I was hoping we could get some more detail on what you saw on the branded price inflation side of the market and maybe pars that out between what you're seeing in traditional drug company versus the specialty group if one area is stronger versus the other. Final question, I'm not sure but could you possibly quantify the H1N1 impact either for revenue or profit? Thanks.
Jeff Campbell: Well, let me take those in a couple, on price inflation as you'll recall, Eric, we gave guidance that we expected it would be overall level of branded price increases for the year to be roughly the same as they were last year. We're only 90 days into the year. I'd tell you for the June quarter we're certainly on track to be consistent with our guidance or maybe even a little better but it's very, very early. On H1N1, I guess what I'd say is if you look at the impact this has had on various other companies, we're in the range, so it's a nice boost to us at the bottom line. It's not particularly meaningful on the top line. And on LIFO, it's really remember an annual concept and any more significant adjustments that we generally make in the March quarter so year-over-year there is nothing significant in terms of change on the LIFO adjustment.
Eric Coldwell – Robert W. Baird & Co.: I'm sorry, John. Jeff, on the price inflation, we thought that price inflation was running a little bit ahead of target and I guess specifically we've heard that some of the price increases on the biotech and specialty side have been very strong recently and we've seen some buy-ins from some of your manufacturer partners. I'm just curious if you could pars out specialty group which got more attention on this call versus traditional distribution. Thanks.
Jeff Campbell: Well the short answer is no. That was not a materially different group for us this quarter and in general of course we would be sensitive to comment on specific manufacturers.
John Hammergren: Eric, back to your conversation about H1N1, the most significant impact on a relative basis probably was in the med/surge business. If you look at the revenue line of med/surge you'll see that it grew much faster than what we would have said the normal market growth rates are and as you know med/surge carries a slightly higher profit margin than our pharmaceutical distribution business so on a relative basis good revenue.
Eric Coldwell – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Right. And John, I guess what I am looking at is one of your closest competitors PSS put up 2.7% benefit from swine flu as they quantified it with a higher incremental margin so –
John Hammergren: And I think, Eric, the point is that we're consistent with that range in our medical surgical business, we also had a little bit of uptick from calls to our nurse triage centers in both Australia, New Zealand, (inaudible) Australia and New Zealand in the U.S. and you had a small uptick in sales of a few drugs you'd expect like Tamiflu in the U.S. pharma business.
Operator: Our next question will come from John Ransom. Your line is open.
John Ransom – Raymond James: Hi, it looks like your anxiety around sell-side margin was pretty high in early March. Relative to say, if that was the pick up has your concern moderated, stayed the same or gotten better?
Jeff Campbell: I missed the first part. Were you saying sell-side margin?
John Ransom – Raymond James: Yeah, you guys expressed some concern about it seems around the early March time frame you started expressing concern about sell-side margin pressure to investors. Has that gotten any better since early March?
Jeff Campbell: Well clearly, it has been and it continues to be something that we have anxiety about it and we have to manage the sell-side very carefully. All of the progress we can make across the rest of our business can be destroyed by not having discipline around the way we manage the sell-side. At the same time it's a very competitive market and always has been a competitive market and we have to remain competitive or we lose share and that will lose our scale. So I think we do whatever we can to stem the tide from a customer loss perspective and try to sell on value rather than selling on price. So I think it's too early to tell whether or not our ability to continue to convince our customers that we provide a better value all around without having to use price always is the solution so, we're working on that and I think we've had some success in certain areas of kind of holding our own which was clearly our goal as we came into the year but we did have two significant losses and we're going to have to deal with those losses all year long and we're going to have to lap those losses and we're going to have to be careful that those losses don't continue in the rest of our business.
John Ransom – Raymond James: Okay, thanks and couple other things. The ESOP, where would that be found in the P&L? Is that in G&A on the distribution business? Would it be lower G&A?
John Hammergren: It is in SG&A and to use real round numbers it's sort of roughly split between the distribution and technology business with a small portion in corporate.
Jeff Campbell: Operator, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question is going to come from Randall Stanicky. Your line is open.
Randall Stanicky – Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks for the question. I'll just be quick with a follow-up on the generics business. Maybe Jeff, there's been a lot of focus on generic manufacturing concerns, has this at all helped you gain traction as you put up some pretty good numbers on your One Stop business and then when you talk about the three drivers compliance, retention of customers and launch schedule, can you maybe quantify going forward what's going to be the bigger one or two drivers there? Thanks.
Jeff Campbell: Well, the generic manufacturers continue to be good partners with us. We work with all of them and from time to time, there are people that earn the privilege of prime spots with us and there are times we earn the privilege of dealing with them so it's a two way street and we add value I think both parties add value to the customer at the end of the day which is the most important priority, how we make sure our customers get the right product at the right time and have a competitive price. As to the launch schedules we knew this year was going to be slightly lighter launch schedule than normal, so superior execution in terms of getting customers attracted to our programs, getting them compliant to the programs and they're doing a great job of sourcing has been critical and will remain critical and I think do a very good job of executing that environment so 19% growth rate is good and certainly we believe above the market particularly when we had this headwind with the loss customers to lap. So I'm hopeful we'll be able to build a strong performance throughout the year but as we look to next fiscal year we have a much better launch schedule lined up as well. So I think this momentum should continue. I want to thank everybody for their time today on the call. I'm very pleased with our first quarter performance. I'm very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in both of our segments and I look forward to continuing to chat with all of you as we progress throughout the year and I'll hand the call off to Ana for a review of our upcoming events for the financial community. Ana?
Ana Schrank: Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events on September 11 we'll present at Thomas Weisel Partners Healthcare Conference in Boston, on November 12, we'll present at the Credit Suisse Healthcare Conference in Phoenix, on November 18, we will present at the Lazard Capital Markets Healthcare Conference in New York, we will release second quarter earnings results in late October. We look forward to seeing you at one of these upcoming events. Thank you and goodbye.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to McKesson Corporation's fiscal 2009 fourth quarter conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce Ana Schrank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Ana Schrank: Good afternoon and welcome to the McKesson fiscal 2009 fourth quarter earnings call. With me today are John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO, and Jeff Campbell, our CFO. John will first provide a business update and will then introduce Jeff, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After Jeff's comments we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 6:00 p.m. Eastern time. Before we begin I'll remind listeners that during the course of this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current, and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements.  Thanks, and here is John Hammergren.
John H. Hammergren: Thanks everyone for joining us on our call. Today we reported a solid finish to fiscal 2009. For the fourth quarter we achieved total company sales of $26.2 billion and fully diluted earnings per share of $1.01. Looking at our full year results, you can see the strength of our business model. Excluding the AWP charge we were able to grow revenues by 5%, which we leveraged into 14% growth and operating income and in turn, generated another strong year in earnings per share momentum, finishing fiscal 2009 with 23% EPS growth. Most of our businesses performed extremely well in fiscal 2009 with a particularly solid performance in Distribution Solutions. We had another successful year with our generics program where we use our size, scale, and experience to negotiate great savings for our customers. Generics continue to be a good source of margin expansion for our business. Our success with generics results from three primary drivers: retention and penetration of our customer base, which brings additional generic volume into the McKesson channel; driving compliance with our customers to ensure that generic purchases are made from McKesson and not alternate suppliers; and the steady pace of generic launches. Sales for our proprietary generics program OneStop grew 26% this quarter and 35% for the year.  We expect fiscal 2010 to be another year of continued profit growth in generics, although the product pipeline is somewhat leaner that it has been in the past two years. There will also be some impact on our year-over-year comparisons from the lapping of the Safeway transition to our OneStop Generics program, which happened in the spring of last year. In fiscal 2009 compensation under our agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers showed a solid increase year-over-year. We have excellent relationships with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers that have improved the stability and predictability of our earnings. We expect branded price inflation in fiscal 2010 will be similar to that of fiscal 2009 levels. And we are managing expenses in a disciplined and innovative way, including cost containment initiatives in our global searching programs, while we coordinate and optimize purchasing across the various businesses and geographies of McKesson. We are operating in a challenging environment though, and growth rates in Distribution Solutions have come down and we began to see some increased pressure on our sell side margins in the U.S. pharmaceutical during our fourth quarter. In Technology Solutions some hospital and physician office customers are still deferring purchases until they are more comfortable with the environment and we are continuing a more conservative approach to our capital structure given the financial market and economic climate. So against that backdrop we have taken some steps to continue our progress in fiscal 2010. Starting in the third quarter and continuing in the fourth quarter we implemented cost control actions across the company, including workforce reductions. We held operating expenses flat for the quarter. That was accomplished through thoughtful and well executed cost reduction actions throughout our business. We plan to keep our operating costs flat in fiscal 2010 with focus on additional cost reductions. As I hope you know, our goal to communicate about our business in a straight-forward, consistent and transparent manner has always been the case. Continuing this tradition of a straight-forward dialogue, let me talk a little bit about the trends in our business and their impact on fiscal 2010. We started to see slowing growth in our Distribution Solutions revenue, which was evident as we finished the quarter despite the fact that it did not have significant impact on our fourth quarter results. We do expect that pressure on revenues will continue though, in fiscal 2010.  IMS has forecasted negative growth for the industry for the next year. We believe today, and have consistently said in the past, that IMS growth rates do not exactly correlate to our growth rates, as we have grown faster for several years. But we do consider IMS to be directionally correct regarding the industry's slowing growth. So while we are encouraged by the recent IMS data, we are mindful of the realities of the current economy. Taking this into consideration, we are guiding to modest revenue growth in Distribution Solutions, primarily driven by our expectation for less robust growth in U.S. pharmaceutical revenues for fiscal 2010. Let me emphasize that we have high expectations for long-term growth in U.S. pharma, particularly in light of the proposed healthcare reform, which has the potential to include almost 50.0 million more Americans in our healthcare system. For many years we have outperformed the expectations of our customers from the service and value perspective and we've been rewarded for that value with great margin expansion. Fiscal 2010 will be the first year in many years that our goal of expanding the operating margin in Distribution Solutions will be difficult to attain. We recently lost two customer buying groups, one in the institutional segment and the other in the retail independent segment because we were unable to reach mutually beneficial terms upon renewal. These customer losses, which were not the result of service failures, will put further pressure on our revenue growth during fiscal 2010. We continue to have very strong relationships with our customers in both segments due to the value and service we deliver and we introduced several new programs in the fourth quarter to further strengthen our relationships with our valued independent customers and the buying groups they are associated with. These programs offer competitive pricing and an industry-leading generic portfolio in exchange for strong compliance on both branded and generic purchases and participation in our flagship franchise program, Health Mart. In the fourth quarter we also renewed several other large customers. While these renewals lock in the business for the long term, they will create additional margin pressure in fiscal 2010. Together, all these events will drive sell side margins down in fiscal 2010. Going forward, we do not expect future renewals to put further downward pressure on operating margins. We believe all of these actions will allow us to protect and grow our share of pharmaceutical distribution, maintain our operating margin this year, and begin expanding it again next year and our long-term goal remains to drive margin expansion in this segment. Turning to our other U.S.-based businesses in Distribution Solutions, in our specialty care solutions we are pleased to be fully through the oncology therapeutics network integration giving us a clear number two position in this higher growth part of the distribution network. Medical surgical revenues are expected to grow in line with the market, although we expect the top line in this segment to be somewhat impacted by the recession.   We expect solid performance in our Canadian distribution business as pharmaceutical market growth is forecast to be slightly strong there than in the United States. We continue to expand our footprint in Canada with our banner strategy which allows independent pharmacies to remain independently owned while achieving the scale and benefits of a larger chain. We are also leveraging our U.S. brand purchasing scale to improve margins in our Canadian distribution business through our global sourcing initiative. When you take a step back from some of the tougher trends that we face in fiscal 2010 Distribution Solutions is a highly efficient business, run by a seasoned leadership team. I feel confident about our ability manage through the next year and to continue our track record of margin expansion and long-term growth. Recently I attended the National Association of Chain Drug Stores Conference. It struck me that our customer relationships have much deeper over time and the discussions today are completely focused on the future. Customers want to understand the total value that we offer with solutions such as e-voucher, central fill, and our unique adhere to medication therapy management programs. They see us as part of the solutions to their challenges at a strategic level. The team's ability to execute flawlessly as they have demonstrated over the last week in the wake of the swine flu outbreak continues to be a source of pride for me and an excellent example of McKesson's vision of transforming healthcare. We were working closely with our pharmaceutical and medical surgical partners to secure flu-related products required to meet our customers' needs in North America. In situations like this we rely on our emergency preparedness plans where we coordinate with suppliers to ensure that all participants in the supply chain respond in an integrated manner to move products quickly through our distribution network to our customers. Turning now to Technology Solutions. Fiscal 2009 was a tough year for certain parts of this segment although the segment's diverse portfolio and the fact that much of our revenue comes from predictable recurring streams helped mitigate the impact of the economy. External forces such as a severely constrained access to capital led to a slowdown in software sales to hospital and physician office customers. We also experienced some delays in implementations which impacted revenue recognition. Our technology segment has a number of solutions that require little capital investment by the customer. For example, the subscription revenues we received from our payor customers, our relay health connectivity business, and our revenue cycle outsourcing businesses all have highly stable revenue streams. Additionally, with the largest base in the industry, we have stable revenues from maintenance on all our installed solutions.  In mid-fiscal 2009 we implemented cost containment measures to position our technology business more conservatively until we had better visibility to the timing of the markets recovery. We reduced our workforce and made significant reductions in discretionary expenses. We also took steps to improve our business infrastructure, which will improve our overall efficiency in this segment. As a result of the strong performance of some of the businesses within the segment and aggressive cost containment actions revenues were up 3% and operating profit was up 5% for the year. Looking out beyond the next several quarters we are encouraged about the future of our technology business, particularly in light of the increase focus on healthcare information technology by the policy makers in Washington. When the President signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, McKesson was responsive to our customers by creating our Achieve HIP program which is designed to help healthcare providers optimize and accelerate their efforts to improve care delivery. We sponsored a CEO summit in Washington, D.C. to explore the concept of meaningful use of the healthcare information technology. We've also been heavily involved with many of our customers in the past few weeks, the vast majority of whom state that the initial threshold requirements set for meaningful use should be achievable and then have additional functionality built in over time to ensure broad success by all. The ultimate goal is to ensure that we have an efficient automated healthcare system in the United States but the government sets the bar that is too high and will not recognize the practical constraints faced by many of the clinicians who could not achieve this goal if the requirements or excessive or if they come on too soon. McKesson is not only well positioned to move our customers to higher levels of automation but we also can do so over time on an incremental basis. Our customers are very engaged and excited about the stimulus package. Many are actively re-evaluating their road maps and their plans for the next years and we are working with them to ensure that they meet the criteria for stimulus incentives as soon as possible. We see a strong pipeline with new and existing customers, helped by the impact of the stimulus package but our expectations for the stimulus-related buying will not drop to the bottom line in significant amount until fiscal 2011. There we expect Technology Solutions' revenue growth will remain at similar levels to fiscal 2009. We expect to get some leverage from revenue growth and show modest operating margin expansion. Over the last few weeks I've had the opportunity to work closely with the team and examine more deeply the organizations that are building software products across McKesson. The bulk of our software development activities are focused on the hospital market but we also have large teams focused on developing software solutions for our pharmacy and payor customers and we have several development efforts focused on the physician market. As we continue to connect more and more of our healthcare stakeholders we need an enterprise-wide technology plan that outlines a clear and internally aligned direction for the architecture and technologies that we will deploy. Last week I announced that the responsibilities of our chief information officer, Randy Spratt, have been expanded and will now also include chief technology officer as one of the roles. Randy will take the collaborative business-focused approach that he has used with our internal technology function and apply that to our customer-facing software products. Software development will still be managed by the businesses while Randy provides our technology teams with visibility and collaborative direction to meet the needs of all of our customers.  Finding the right leader to keep the Technology Solutions business moving forward is a priority for me. In the meantime, I am confident we are making progress with products and solutions and I continue to be impressed by the talented individuals working in this business who recognize the discipline and focus that will be required to drive this business forward in fiscal 2010. The opportunity to improve the safety, quality, and efficiency of the healthcare system through technology is exciting and McKesson is well positioned to help our customers with our broad set of solutions. In summary, we enter fiscal 2010 with strength in our branded pharmaceutical manufacture relationships, continued growth in generics, and diversity in our technology portfolio. However, we face some challenges with the slowing economic environment and the sell side margin pressure we experienced during the fourth quarter in U.S. pharma. The projections we have outlined do not show the growth that we have seen over the past few years so we have taken actions to prepare for the year ahead, including managing expenses, restructuring our workforce and improving our liquidity. I expect my management team to remain focused on earnings momentum and steady cash flow to enable long-term growth. I believe we have the deepest most talented team in the industry and the quality of our products and services is unparalleled. I am confident in our ability to manage through the current challenges.  Based on the strong position of the company strategically and operationally, we expect 2010 earnings per diluted share of $3.90 to $4.05 from continuing operations for fiscal 2010. I look forward to reporting to you on our progress throughout the year. With that I will turn the call over to Jeff and will return to address your questions when he finishes.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: As you just heard, this was a solid quarter operationally, capping off a year in which we faced a weakening economic environment to which we responded with increasingly aggressive cost controls. In my remarks today I will cover both the full year and fourth quarter results. As you've heard me say before we provide our EPS guidance on an annual basis due to both seasonality and the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations that are inherent in our business. In this context, an annual look at our financial results can provide more meaningful insight into some of the key trends. So I will focus more on the annual numbers than on the quarterly ones today and I will also comment on what these trends might mean for fiscal 2010. Let me begin by reviewing the consolidated statement of operations. I will provide more specifics in my detailed discussion of each segment and as I did in our earnings call last quarter, my comments will exclude the current year impact of the AWP litigation charge and the prior year's securities litigation credit. Our consolidated revenues were up 5% for the full year but were flat for the quarter with both segments showing this same trend. This reflects the slowing economic environment we face as the year progressed.  Gross profit was up 7% for the year and 1% for the quarter, a modest improvement in gross margin in both periods. This was driven by solid gross profit leverage in Distribution Solutions partially offset by a decline in Technology Solutions' gross margin. Turning to operating expenses, while the full year was up 4% the fourth quarter slacked, reflecting our increasing cost control efforts. I would remind you that over the course of the full year we absorbed additional expenses to support our 5% sales growth as well as the cost impact of our acquisitions, in particular OTN and McQuarry. This cost trend bodes well for our fiscal 2010 outlook where we expect our operating expenses to remain relatively flat. Continuing my walk down the P&L, our full year operating income was up a solid 14% to $1.7 billion and up 4% to $498.0 million for the quarter. Other income for the full year and the quarter was impacted by a $63.0 million non-cash impairment charge, or approximately $0.22 per fully diluted share, primarily related to our equity investment in product. Excluding this impairment charge, other income was down significantly for the year and the quarter compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower interest income. Interest income has been affected by short-term interest rates, which have come down dramatically from prior year and historical levels. Our cash is invested conservatively so we are very sensitive to these short-term interest rate movements.  Interest expense for the year and the quarter increased, due to the $700.0 million of debt we issued in February. This higher debt load will impact our fiscal 2010 interest expense. Moving to taxes, we ended the year with a tax run rate of 33% that we'd been using all year, which reflects our mix of foreign and domestic income. The full-year tax provision was favorably impacted by a total of $111.0 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items, including the $22.0 million tax reserves release we previously disclosed as something we expected to happen in the fourth quarter. As a result of these discrete tax benefits we had an effective tax rate of 27.2% for the year. While these discrete tax benefits create some lumpiness in our reported earnings, we are pleased with these outcomes which have materially added to our earnings and financial strength. Our full year diluted EPS from continuing operations was $4.07, an increase of 23% compared to the prior year. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $1.01 in the fourth quarter this year including the $0.22 impact from the impairment charge versus $1.04 in the prior-year fourth quarter. To wrap up our consolidated results, weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased 6% for the year and 5% for the quarter. The number of shares used in these calculations declined primarily due to the cumulative impact of share repurchases. Let's now move on to a discussion of our two segments. In Distribution Solutions our U.S. direct distribution revenues grew a solid 11% for the year and 4% for the quarter, primarily driven by expanded business with existing customers and market growth rates. The full year was also favorably impact by our acquisition of OTN. Our full year warehouse revenues declined 7%, primarily related to lower purchases from one of our customers due to a contract loss which fully lapped in our December quarter. Warehouse revenues were down 4% for the fourth quarter, reflecting reduced purchases from several customers. We are pleased with our Canadian revenues, with growth on a constant currency basis of 10% for the year and 3% for the quarter, driven by new and expanded distribution agreements and market growth rates. Canadian U.S. dollar revenues were affected by an unfavorable currency impact of 20% for the quarter and 9% for the year. As I have said in the past, we are fairly hedged to the Canadian dollar on a consolidated basis given our large IT workforce in Canada. Medical-Surgical revenues were up 6% for the year and 4% for the fourth quarter. As we have previously discussed, we have seen some sequential slowdown in revenue growth leading up to year end in this business. Gross profit for the segment was up 10% for the full year and 2% for the quarter. For both the year and the quarter gross profit is growing faster than revenues driven by an increased generics contribution and strong branded manufacturer compensation. While the sell side margin was relatively stable for the full year, we did begin to experience a modest decline in the fourth quarter. Our Distribution Solutions operating expenses were up 7% for the year but flat for the quarter, in line with our expanding cost control measures previously discussed. Other income for the full year and the quarter was impacted by the $63.0 million equity impairment charge discussed earlier.  For the full year operating profit was up 11%. Our margin was up 9 points to 159 basis points. This is a tremendous performance, given that we stated at the beginning of the year that we expected mid-single digit operating margin expansion and that this progress includes the $63.0 million impairment charge. We were able to outperform our original expectations due to the strength of both our generic programs and our relationships with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers, aided by strong price increases. Turning no to Technology Solutions, revenues were up 3% to $3.1 billion for the year and flat for the quarter at $807.0 million. Services revenues grew 4% to $2.3 billion for the year and 3% to $615.0 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting the stable and recurring nature of these revenues. Software and software systems revenues decreased 3% for the full year and 7% for the quarter driven by the slowdown of new purchases of technology primarily in the hospital and physician office sectors. Our software deferral rate was down 3% to 71% for the full year and down 5% to 72% in the fourth quarter compared to the same prior-year periods. Consistent with the decline of our higher gross margin software and software systems revenues, gross profits flat for the year and decreased 2% for the quarter. Operating expenses were down 2% for the year and 3% for the quarter. We have used aggressive cost containment efforts in technology solutions to show some operating profit and margin expansion for both the year and the quarter despite the slower revenue growth environment. We did not, however, sacrifice R&D investment in our cost containment efforts. We continued to invest significantly in our products, providing solutions that meet the needs of our broad base of customers. As a result, total gross R&D spending for the full year and the quarter was $438.0 million and $121.0 million, up 4% and 9% from comparable prior-year periods. For the full year and the quarter Technology Solutions capitalized 17% of their R&D expenditures. This compares to our prior-year capitalization rates of 18% for the full year and 22% for the quarter. Now on to the balance sheet. On the working capital side, our receivables were up 8% from the prior year, to $7.8 billion and our days sales outstanding was up to 24 days. This increase stems from the fact that we have selectively chosen to offer more extended terms to some of our customers. This increase was not driven by any increase in customers being past due on payments or any other deterioration in our receivables. Compared to a year ago our inventories decreased 5% to $8.5 billion and our payables decreased 2% to $11.7 billion. Our days sales in inventory of 31 days and days sales in payables of 43 days were down two days and one day respectively, on from a year ago. We made a conscious decision to reduce inventory levels modestly this year, which also impacted our days sales payables. For the year, we generated $1.4 billion in operating cash flow. Property acquisitions were $195.0 million for the year, reflecting our continued investments in our pharmaceutical distribution center network, as well as in our internal systems.  Capitalized software expenditures were $197.0 million, up from the $161.0 million we spent last year. So overall, we had $392.0 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 and expect to spend in the same general range, $350.0 million to $400.0 million, in fiscal 2010. Our spending in fiscal 2009 on acquisitions at $358.0 million and share repurchases at $484.0 million slowed due to the financial market and economic environment. We did resume share repurchases in the March quarter, spending $150.0 million, after suspending them in light of last fall's more severe financial market disruption.  With the $700.0 million of debt we issued in February 2009, our gross debt to capital ratio of 29% now approaches the low end of the target capital structure we have talked about for some time, that is having a gross debt to cap ratio in the 30% to 40% range. Now on to our fiscal 2010 earnings guidance of $3.90 to $4.05 per diluted share. I point you to our press release today, where you will find a detailed list of key assumptions underlying this guidance. I do want to take a minute, however, to provide some additional context to our assumptions. In general, our 2010 plan assumes that the economy and the financial markets stay about as they have been for the last few months for most of fiscal 2010. We assume we begin to see a modest uptick towards the end of our fiscal year 2010. Importantly, we do assume that neither the economy nor the financial markets gets significantly worse than they are today. Turning to operating margin, first in Distribution Solutions we expect our operating margin to be flat to up a couple of basis points which, remembering that our FY2009 margin includes the $63.0 million impairment charge, is clearly off our historical trend line due to the challenges John discussed earlier. In our Technology Solutions business, despite the slower revenue growth environment, our cost control efforts should allow us to achieve some operating margin expansion. And finally to the issue of quarterly progression. As I have detailed in previous earnings calls, we do not provide quarterly EPS guidance generally due to the variability in the quarterly timing of certain items of our business. That said, we would expect fiscal 2010 to approximate the seasonal pattern of earnings we saw in fiscal 2009, if you take out of the 2009 quarterly progression the unusual impairment, discrete tax, and gain on sale items. Said another way, the fourth quarter will continue to be our strongest quarter by a fair amount, with the first three quarters showing some modest, sequential build. In closing, we believe we posted solid results in fiscal 2009 in the face of turbulent economic times. For fiscal 2010 we have aggressively cut costs to offset the headwinds we face while leaving the company strongly poised for the inevitable economic rebound, the growing impact of the stimulus bill and the lapping of some of the sell side pressures we have experienced. This should leave us well positioned to resume the kinds of growth levels that we demonstrated over the last several years. With that we will turn the call over for our questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Lawrence Marsh - Barclays Capital.
Lawrence Marsh - Barclays Capital: The first one for John, I know you don't like to talk too much about individual relationships on the distribution or tech side but you did call out a loss of an institutional retail buying group relationship here. Is there any way to elaborate on that at all? And then along with that, the message today that the environment is consistent with what you communicated back a couple of months ago, has it gotten progressively any worse or is there any other data point there?
John H. Hammergren: To your point, we normally don't talk about specific customers and I think at this time, because of our change in pace, so to speak, from a performance perspective we felt that it was at least helpful to investors to understand sort of the driving forces behind our inability to get margin expansion this year, at least in a clear view as we come out of the gate. We did lose about $3.0 billion worth of business in those two CTO contracts. As you mentioned, one is in the independent segment, a company called CTA, and the other is in the hospital segment, a company called HPG. We had long-term relationships with both of those customers that we both spent some time and felt we had created some value but in the end we were not successful in negotiating terms that we felt we could move forward with and as a result went our separate ways. So I am disappointed with those decisions and clearly we are hopeful that we will continue to drive value in the marketplace and over time regain our positions, not only with them but with any other customer that finds that other alternatives are better. But our focus now is to regain our momentum and move forward this year. As it relates to the overall economy, I would say that we saw slowing results in the distribution business in the fourth quarter and both med-surg and pharmaceuticals to some extent on the demand side. The technology business remained relative where we expected it to be and the trends there I would say stabilized to some extent, and as we talked about in the past, some of the contracts that had pushed from previous periods pushed into the fourth quarter and I'm sure that some that we expected in the fourth quarter had pushed into fiscal 2010.  But I think the slowness, particularly in our med-surg business and U.S. pharmaceutical business, to some extent on the revenue side, accelerated slightly in the fourth quarter.
Lawrence Marsh - Barclays Capital: And that's because of the loss of the relationships as you talked about?
John H. Hammergren: Those losses really didn't impact the fourth quarter at all. Maybe a little bit on the HPG side but it was really late in the quarter when that started to happen. So I think just a little slowness overall, maybe driven by the unemployment numbers and some of the things that had started to hit. But not significant. I think that just slightly down from where it was before.
Lawrence Marsh - Barclays Capital: And Jeff, your communication is for in the Distribution Solutions business revenues, you were saying revenue growth is going to accelerate slightly for fiscal 2010 or revenues are going to be up modestly for fiscal 2010?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: We were just talking about absolute revenues, up modestly.
Lawrence Marsh - Barclays Capital: And on the tax rate it looks like you will get some benefit this year. Maybe a percent or so from last year. Is there anything in particular that would drive the reduction in your tax rate?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Our tax rate is really driven by the mixture of foreign and domestic income so the fact that the run rate is going from 33 to 32 should suggest to you that we're growing slightly faster in some of the lower tax jurisdictions where we do business.
Lawrence Marsh - Barclays Capital: And finally, John, you said you said you hope to announce a new head of your new technology business, or is that still way premature?
John H. Hammergren: It's probably premature. As you recall that business is really a bunch of different businesses and so there are presidents running the various segments within MTS and I'm actually enjoying the opportunity of spending a little more time with directly and do a little deeper dive into the businesses and one of the things that I mentioned in my prepared remarks was the accretion of this all-encompassing sort of span breaker job of CTO that will help us transfer knowledge and best practices between some of the ordinary silos that exist in different businesses.  So I am actively in this game to replace the MTS role but I don't feel an urgent need to jump quickly. I would rather get a good sense for what the qualifications are that are going to be most important and to make the selection prudently.
Operator: Your next question comes from Lisa Gill - J.P. Morgan.
Lisa Gill - J.P. Morgan: John, on the healthcare IT side, I think that you talked about the opportunity really being more in fiscal 2011 but as I listen to your healthcare IT peers, they're consistently talking about late 2009. Can you maybe just reconcile the two for me? Is it that your customers bases are different or maybe you're just more conservative around your expectations.  And then secondly, are you seeing any opportunities around acquisitions within healthcare IT where perhaps you want to fill some holes within your portfolio? And maybe even pick up a new head of that business as well.
John H. Hammergren: Clearly acquisitions have been a part of our strategy in our technology business and we will continue to look for acquisitions that make sense economically and strategically for us. I don't think we have any particular major holes in our offering but clearly in this environment with capital constraints on our competitors and perhaps the customers that are looking for bigger, all-encompassing relationships that will afford us more opportunities to continue to consolidate in the industry. So I don’t think we have an urgent need there but I think we can be opportunistic, and clearly we are always looking to bring talent into the company through these acquisitions. On the timing side, it's difficult for any of us, I would argue even our competitors, to guess as to when these results might actually show up in our businesses. I would tell you that the sales organization is as optimistic as I've seen them relative to the sales channel and the demand that appears on the horizon that is yet to contract for our solutions, so they're very bullish about our ability to pull it in, make it into a contract. I guess I'm a little less optimistic in terms of getting it implemented and recognizable in a percentage of completion kind of way. Some of our competitors, in fact, might have software that is more shrink wrapped and they're able to recognize revenues when they ship it or when they install and easy physician system for example. Our more complex hospital customers and our physician customers for that matter that are pursuing a more integrated and holistic approach, that complexity might impede our ability to get the revenue rack at the same time that our competitors would, even if the contracts were signed at the same time because of the scale of what we're trying to do. But whether it happens in December or April, clearly I think we're all saying the same thing and that is that the stimulus package is going to be a positive thing for our industry and we should benefit from it and we are well positioned for it.
Lisa Gill - J.P. Morgan: And I think some of the hospitals have talked about big the opportunity is or how many dollars they think they're going to get from the stimulus. Have you had those conversations? Do you have a number that you've pulled together to say what your potential opportunity is given your customer base?
John H. Hammergren: Well, we've done a lot of internal work and right now we're mapping every one of customers in terms of the applications that are going to be necessary to get the meaningful use, and as important, the implementation required to get the meaningful use. So it's one thing to buy these things, it's another thing to get it implemented and working in a way where they can demonstrate meaningful use. And it's even more challenging when meaningful use hasn't been defined. So there are a lot of open issues there, but I would tell you that I think that we have significant opportunity, not only in our existing customer base, which we can map more easily, but increasingly customers are coming to us that aren't typical McKesson customers. At least not what we would consider to be our base customers, that might have some applications and some experience with McKesson but they're looking at replacing their incumbent supplier of HIT solutions and McKesson is showing very well in those accounts.  Particularly some of the smaller accounts, community hospitals that want to get there and get there and want to get there quickly and the small software companies that they might have contracted with in the past may not have the products or the financial strength to get them where they need to go. So products like our Paragon product for example, that's selling very rapidly and there's a long queue of customers that are even lined up to get into the demo cycle on that product. So we are excited about the potential that exists.
Operator: Your next question comes from Charles Boorady – Citigroup.
Charles Boorady - Citigroup: First on healthcare technology, what metrics can you share with us to support your demand outlook? Is there a number of inbound inquiries or bookings, etc.
John H. Hammergren: We gave you some rough ideas in terms of revenue and profit that we expect next year for FY2010 and I think that we learned a long time ago not to quote sales funnels until they materialize into contracts. So all I can do is kind of quote you from a directional perspective that we believe those pipelines are robust and that those pipelines will turn into bookings and subsequently turn into revenue and earnings. But it's probably premature and probably not appropriate for us to talk about, to bring new metrics into place that we've never really believed in the past, things like sales funnels that we've discouraged our team from counting too much on.
Charles Boorady - Citigroup: And in terms of the margins, one would generally expect margin pressure in a year like this when demand is taking a pause ahead of what's expected to be, an acceleration in demand as a result of this stimulus, and so if you just think about any new hiring and other infrastructure and other investments you would be making in anticipation of an increase in demand, it would seem like that should be a lower margin year. Am I missing something or are there some costs cuts that would offset what otherwise would be a lower margin year?
John H. Hammergren: Well, we're hopeful that it won't be a lower margin year but clearly if software sales are slowing it's going to be harder for us to get operating margin expansion. As Jeff and I both mentioned in our prepared comments, across all of our segments the last two quarters and accelerating into the fourth quarter, we took very aggressive cost reduction moves. Not only in reducing the existing headcount, shutting down open positions, freezing travel, shutting facilities, doing whatever we could to sort of to prepare for a slower growth environment.  But to your point, we also have a responsibility to understand where our customers need us from a manpower perspective to get these implementations going. So some costs will begin to rise on manpower slated for implementation. We clearly have to train these folks, we have to get them ready, and then we have to dispatch them to help bring the customers live. And so we will begin to see some pressure on our business from a margin perspective on the cost side as we get ready for this ramp, but I think that's included in the guidance we've given you. So we still expect to get leverage in the business in fiscal 2010.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robert Willoughby - BAS-ML.
Robert Willoughby - BAS-ML: What do you not put into the IT guidance, given some of the uncertainties out there? Are there larger clinical applications that hit that you just don't anticipate or that you can't foresee closing on a quarterly basis? And then secondarily, do you foresee any material changes in the business mix this fiscal year from any divestitures? Are there assets on board here that might be worth more independently?
John H. Hammergren: I think that on the revenue side of that business, fortunately there is a bunch of predictable revenue and technology where we can see out several quarters if not a year or more, on the revenue and margin that we're going to get.  Some of the larger software deals are more difficult to forecast, not only when they sign, but when we will actually be able to recognize the revenue against them, based on the way the contracts are constructed. So I would think that our projections for fiscal 2010 are plus or minus correct in a relatively narrow range for that business. What we'll see, and we will be able to forecast more aggressively, is these new contracts that will come in related to the stimulus package. But those won't really impact FY2010 we don't think to a large degree. So as we get through the middle of this year we will probably have a better sight on what FY2011 is going to look like. As to the portfolio, clearly I think a well-tuned machine would constantly evaluate what's in the asset portfolio and what's necessary, at least ask what's missing. Sometimes you have things you don't need and I think that we have a responsibility to constantly revisit that and you have seen us from time to time make divestitures when we're not scaled and we're not profitable and we have done that. We've done it sometimes with the ventures, like Verispan or we've done with our pharmacy management business. We did it with the acute care business in med-surg, so we're not really stuck in a model if we can't win and get a positive attribute from the way that that business flows to us.  So that's part of what I'm actually doing in this interim phase is doing a little deeper dive on the assets and spending some more time with the executives in MTS to understand what their views are of these businesses.
Robert Willoughby - BAS-ML: Are there any businesses of size or consequence that are unprofitable for you currently?
John H. Hammergren: Yes, I don't think generally speaking, unprofitable, no. We have small businesses that are unprofitable all the time that are trying to grow but they're not really that material to us. I think the biggest thing for us is what prospects do they have for growth and what management time are they consuming that prevents us from being more focused and disciplined on things that give us more opportunity. So I think that that's more likely to be the case. I don't think there's a big value-creating divestiture that we could do on a money-losing venture that would suddenly cause the P&L to expand rapidly.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank Securities.
Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank Securities: You made a point to talk about the financial health of the customer base and as you go through what you've been seeing from a terms perspective or in terms of receivables or bad debt, I'm sure you've gone through a fairly thorough analysis. I mean, are there any particular pieces of business that you're at all concerned with? And what are you sort of tracking of in terms of understanding the relative health of some of the key customers? Maybe some of your larger customers that might have been struggling in this economic environment?
John H. Hammergren: I think we're always concerned about all of our customers and their economic plight and we try to do in on multiple dimensions. First is obviously whether they're paying us on time and whether the channels of communication are open to us. And obviously we have to continue to do our own deep dive research behind the scenes as to what their credit status might be. Clearly, coming into this environment hospitals were already under significant pressure as were many retailers and we've seen some in our industry experience failures as a result. I think that we do a good job of managing the risk and I can't tell you that we don't have it but I can say that I think we have pretty good visibility to it. And clearly there are some very large risks that we face that have been talked about frequently on calls like this.
Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank Securities: And on the IT side, in terms of adoption, I know a couple of others touched on this in the questions, how do you think about where the initial dollars are going to glow between the hospital and the physician practice. You have your own set ups in each of the different markets but if you had to gauge which one you thought was going to start to see more activity and then if you thought the types of solutions you have on the hospital side, how do you think about that in terms of penetration rates, in terms of what piece of your business do you think on the hospital side specifically so you think you would see the biggest delta where people really need to kind of get up to optimum adoption from a technology perspective?
John H. Hammergren: Well I think the hospitals are going to be the biggest field for revenue and margin creation in this environment. They just have more complex environments and they have to spend more to accomplish their objectives. And so I think the hospital segment is going to be very important to us. And they will probably being buying sooner to accomplish meaningful use as compared to the physician marketplace, primarily because they have more access to capital today but it's going to take them longer to implement the successful integration of some of these systems, and if they don't start really now, at least in the buying cycle, and begin the implementation, they won't be ready by 2011 or 2012 to accomplish the objective. The physicians can start a little later and can get up to speed faster and so there might be some quick hits on that side a little later but I don't think that overall the number of dollars spent by doctors is going to be as great as the number of dollars spent by hospitals to get into need for use. And so albeit we should begin to see the buying side of this business this fiscal year because of the complexity, it's likely that the revenue and earnings will fall largely in 2011.
Operator: Your next question comes from Richard Close - Jefferies & Co.
Richard Close - Jefferies & Co.: On the sell side margin pressure, maybe some more details along that. You mentioned a couple of renewals at lower levels and the contract losses but not service related. How much [inaudible] on the sell side margin today as opposed to last year or in the past? Maybe if you could walk us through the primary difference there today versus previously.
John H. Hammergren: The model for our businesses remain the same for some time and that is that we get our margins through bringing in revenue, managing our relationships with the branded manufacturers in a way where we can earn a return on that work, and selling more higher value, higher margin products like generics, and those are offset by expenses which we try to control rigorously. And then the sell margin. And so the business has always been a competitive but in the past we've typically been able to offset any sell margin erosion with expansion in other parts of our profit streams. As we went into this fiscal year it became obvious to us that that was not going to be possible given the challenges that we faced and that's why it's a little different environment. I think competition is always in the eye of the beholder to some extent. Clearly we are very disappointed that this has been the result of the last quarter and these new data points come on quickly, based on the negotiations, so looking forward, we're continuing to train ourselves for us to sell value. We're focused on making sure that when our customers ask for our best price, they have to give us their best commitment. It has to be a fulsome commitment in terms of volume commitments and share commitments within their book of business and we have to pick up the value-added items of generics, etc. and in an environment where people are asking for this same kind of requirements, sometimes things can get a little distorted. So we continue to focus on selling value and training our sales force to do that and we are hopeful that we will continue to be successful.
Richard Close - Jefferies & Co.: On the OneStop Generics [inaudible] in the quarter and you mentioned the lapping of Safeway, I guess that has begun or happened in the fourth quarter. Any update on larger customers in the generic programs, like Target or Safeway that you've done in the past? Do you still see opportunities on that front going forward?
John H. Hammergren: I sure think so. I mean, we have been focused in our portfolio and if you go back several years ago we wouldn't have thought these larger customers were even possible targets, so I mentioned in my earlier conversation our focus on our global sourcing initiatives in trying to bring the full book of McKesson's business on behalf of our customers into the marketplace and negotiate on their behalves great deal with these manufacturers and in return giving our manufacturer partners great share opportunities that comes on quickly. And so I think we are forever focused on expanding our position and I think there's been some press releases recently of our expansion of our generic programs into the hospital marketplace for generics, and so not only are we trying to grow upstream in terms of bigger customers in our existing markets, but also expanding into markets that are willing to use wholesalers as the primary source of the product. And so I remain optimistic we can grow our generic program next year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Eric Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co.
Eric Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co.: I'm curious whether you could comment on the OneStop Generics growth excluding the year-over-year contribution from Safeway.
John H. Hammergren: That's a good question. It would have been lower. I don't think we have the number right in front of us. But we were consistently in double-digit growth, even before Safeway came on so I would assume that number is somewhere above 10% and somewhere probably less than 25%. I know it's a broad range. I can get it to you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Constantine Davides - JMP Securities.
Constantine Davides - JMP Securities: Jeff, you talked about more modest growth expectations in the specialty group. Can you elaborate on that a bit and the nature of some of the pressure you're seeing there?
Jeffrey C. Campbell: In the specialty group?
Constantine Davides - JMP Securities: That's right. I thought you made some comments in your prepared remarks about specialty growth being more tempered.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: I don't think so. We didn't particularly comment on specialty. I guess I would make the observation that we are pleased with the position that we are in now and as [inaudible] number two. We are through with the OTN integration and our expectation is you should see that business growing roughly in line with the market. And obviously tagging the market is a little bit of a moving target right now but if I was to take a shot at it, it's probably in the 5% to 7% range.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser – UBS.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: The [inaudible] is this [inaudible] one-time inventory adjustments or do you think that this is just [inaudible] markets.  And then in your guidance, can you just walk us through the low end versus the high end. It sounds like your distribution margin expectations are pretty tight, and you said flat to up a couple of basis points. So without the other factors that forged the $3.90 versus the high end at the $4.05.
Jeffrey C. Campbell: Let me work backwards and you were breaking up a little bit so I'm not sure I actually got the first question, but let me kind of start with the guidance. So we gave a guidance range from $3.90 to $4.05 and I think what I would encourage people to do is really go right to the series of key assumptions that you see us use and a couple of those things are pretty key to what gets you either towards the higher end or the lower end. So exactly what happens with the revenue growth rates, whether branded price inflation stays extremely strong, as it has been for the last year, or softens a little bit. And you heard us, in both John's remarks and in my remarks, talk about the fact that while we have baked in the pressure we have experienced on the sell side, what we have baked in going forward is really no further significant declines in the sell side that would impact our operating margins. So those are probably the biggest things that I would point to as you think about what's going to drive us toward the higher end or the lower end of the range. And then as to the first question, John is signaling me that he's got it.
John H. Hammergren: I think what you asked was about revenue growth and whether inventory reductions by our customers might have affected our revenue growth or something to do with inventory. So I am happy to have you ask it again. Our revenue growth in the quarter was pretty good and we had lost a piece of warehouse business in the past that netted against our DSD business but otherwise it fell pretty much in line with our expectations and what we have historically delivered. Was there something we missed on inventory?
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: In terms of warehouse sales, you're not seeing inventory adjustments on your customer side?
John H. Hammergren: We might be but not something that's been brought to our attention. The primary change in inventory numbers was driven by—excuse me, in warehouse sales—was driven by the loss of a customer, not by any overt change necessarily in their inventory level.
Operator: Your final question comes from Eugene Mannheimer - Auriga USA .
Eugene Mannheimer - Auriga USA : I hate to beat the health IT horse, but let me ask you this. Those customers, are they more motivated by the carrot, i.e. the financial incentives to implement IT or the stick, namely the penalties in not doing so? And that might help us get a sense for when the buying is going to take place.
John H. Hammergren: I don't know that there is a universal answer that would apply to all of them. I have spoken primarily to McKesson's largest hospital customers, I haven't spoken with a lot of physicians, particularly the smaller physicians. I would say the hospitals are motivated by the carrot and they don't want to miss the stimulus and I don't think they want to be non-competitive in their markets by being behind from the technology perspective. I think there's an awareness that there's a stick following the carrot but I think that that probably will be more the impact will be felt more there on the physician side, frankly, as the laggard physicians finally either retire or have to come up to speed and use technology. But I think that for the most part the forward-thinking hospitals and the forward-thinking physicians are going to try to get to value and demonstrated meaningful use so they can collect the stimulus and they can remain viable in their markets. So I want to thank you for your questions and also thank all of you on the call today for your time. I'm confident in our ability to manage through these current challenges and to stay focused on our earnings momentum and steady cash flow and to obviously enable long-term opportunities to continue to be here from a growth perspective.

Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to McKesson Corporation Fiscal 2009 Second Quarter Conference Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded, if you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Ana Schrank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ma'am.
Ana Schrank - Vice President of Investor Relations: Thank you Angie. Good afternoon and welcome to the McKesson fiscal 2009 second quarter conference call for the financial community. With me today are John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO and Jeff Campbell, our CFO. John will first provide a business update and we'll then introduce Jeff who will review the financial results for the quarter. After Jeff's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 6:00 PM Eastern Time. Before we begin, I'll remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and Q3 results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risk associated with such forward-looking statements. Thanks and here is John Hammergren.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Ana and thanks everyone for joining us on our call today. I'm please that McKesson turned in solid results for the quarter despite tough economic conditions. While we're not immune from the effects of a weak economy, our second quarter performance demonstrates that our diverse portfolio of businesses operated in resilient markets with an impact to our overall financial model thus far has been relatively modest. But it isn't enough to operate in great market, it's even more important to have a leadership position which we do. We are the leader in pharmaceutical distribution not only in the United Sates but across North America. We have a leading position in medical surgical distribution, in the alternate-site market and our strategic acquisition of Oncology Therapeutic Networks made us a much stronger player in the specialty market. And with the broadest portfolio in the industry, we are the leader in Healthcare Technology Solutions. Although the equity markets may not responding favorably to healthcare right now, our second quarter earnings demonstrate that despite a challenging macro environment, we continue to post solid financial results. The majority of products and services that we provide has steady demand and we've seen our businesses maintain their volume momentum across most parts of our company. Our solid base of revenue and profits, our range of products and services that deliver value to clients and a strong and flexible financial foundation give McKesson the competitive edge. Even with slight moderation in the short term demand, we remain confident in our business outlook. Turning to our second quarter results, our solid performance for the quarter was driven by the distribution solution segment, which accounted for the largest portion of earnings and provides a great base for our company. We gave guidance at the start of our fiscal year that we would grow revenues at the market and adjust that gross rate based on our mix of business which is very positive. Our mix of customers is very favorable, as our customers have grown slightly faster than the market. We also are integrating two acquisitions, Oncology Therapeutics Network in our Specialty Care Solutions business and McQueary Brothers in our U.S. pharmaceutical business, both of which have helped accelerate revenue growth. Despite industry concerns about slowing prescription trends, we see steady growth from our customers. In U.S. Pharmaceutical, excluding in our acquisition of OTN and McQueary and one extra day of sales, our core-direct revenues grew a healthy 7%. In Canada, revenues wrap at solid 30% excluding one extra day of sales. Short-term, we do not view our distribution business as particularly sensitive just growing prescription trends. Our strong revenue growth this quarter again demonstrates that we grow faster than the growth rates reported by IMS. We believe IMS is directionally correct, but not appropriate correlation to our top line. Looking long term we remain bullish about the broader demographics in North America, and what that would do for future demands for pharmaceuticals. Now most of you are familiar with the two main sources of gross margin value in our business, our relationships of branded manufacturers and our relationships with generic manufacturers. For those of you that are new to our story and are modeled or those who might have questions about how we'll perform in a difficult economic climate, here is how it works. For our branded manufacturing partners we are a highly effective logistics provider, ensuring products to reach patients safely and on time. We manage the complex financial transactions associated with pharmaceutical delivery, ensure the integrity of the supply chain and manage the credit risk of our customer base. Our sophisticated systems, particularly our redistribution center allow manufacturers to minimize supply chain cost and maintain consistency across all markets. Of the various services we provide to branded manufacturers, we are typically compensated through formal arrangement to specify the level and type of compensation, based on each service we provide. These agreements have improved the visibility and the predictability of our compensation. We do have a big role in serving the demand created by inform consumers that are not only aging but also recognizing that drugs are the first and best line of defense against increased costs and more medical challenges later in life. It all starts with the complete supply of the product as the time the drug is needed and grows much further as we improve the operation and dispensing for both manufacturers and our retail and hospital customers. In addition to the services we provide to branded manufacturers, we provide the generics manufacturers for significantly more value. Because we manage an influenced demand, we are compensated with higher margins than on the branded side. We deliver significant market share to the generic manufacturers and we have greater execution with rapid and complete customer supply. We pick the right partners on both side of the transaction and we make a market that is efficient and effective. It couldn't happen without the wholesaler. This has made McKesson a crucial launch partner for generics manufacturers, both at the time of the launch, but also well into the later life cycle of the products. The market is more efficient and effective with us putting together buyers and sellers and then managing the details of the business. McKesson, our customers and patients all benefit because the cost base for the generic drug is lower than the branded drug. Because we add the value I described earlier, we earn a much higher margin and have developed business model to deliver a higher return on investment. So the generic model has superior profitability and lower working capital investment resulting in higher return on capital. We've been able to grow our generic penetration faster than the market using our customer eccentric approach; the program is designed for each segment of our customer base. We have tremendous value for our customers when we take over the generic purchasing. They trust us and we deliver. They win as we win. While we are reasonably well penetrated with generics in the independent segment, we are positioned for growth with retail chains, hospitals and long-term care. The programs for these customer segments have been developed over the last several years and are now gaining momentum. All of our customer segments have opportunities for incremental sales growth as market momentum build and customers' look for generic drug purchasing and distribution solutions with a proven track record. A strong generics pipeline and our ability to grow our base of customers, in OneStop generics, our proprietary generics program, are crucial components of our strategy to drive margin expansion over the next several years. This quarter we benefited both from new launches and penetration of the customer base to bring additional generic volume into the channel. As a result sales grew for OneStop an impressive 49% once again significantly above market growth. We continue to deliver great value to our customers and they continue to reward us. Just one year after becoming a U.S. pharmaceutical distribution customer, Pamida a regional retailer with restores primarily in the Midwest, named McKesson as the vendor partner of the year. The customer was recognized for the flawless integration of its 144 pharmacies into the U.S. pharma network and for the value we provide through our proprietary generics programs. In addition to participating in OneStop generics, Pamida uses our RxPak program and is a customer of RelayHealth. Turning now to our specialty business, we are now a clear number two player in this space, which is important to us as the market continues to include some of the fastest growing categories of drugs in the United States. Last week, you learned of our decision to sell our specialty pharmacy business to Walgreen's. At the time of the OTN acquisition, we determined we would dispose the specialty pharmacy. But we wanted to do a careful review as we went through integrated process. Specialty pharmacy was a small part of our overall Specialty Care Solutions business. So, this sale would not have a material impact on our financial expectations. We did not see a way to get this business to the level of share and profitability that McKesson requires. This business and the McKesson teammates that help drive it should be a good fit for Walgreen's which have an existing business in this space. The remaining parts of Specialty Care Solutions will continue to deliver services to manufacturers, payers and providers including distribution, coordinated reimbursement and clinical services. Our Onmark GPO, our world- class Lynx technology platforms in clinical tools provide value added information that helps improve efficiency and patient safety. On going beyond U.S. pharmaceutical they were strong performance from other businesses within Distribution Solutions. In the second quarter, we have solid growth in Canadian Distribution Businesses, from new and expanded customer agreements. We also had positive results in medical surgical distribution with particularly strong results again reported from our homecare group. In the second quarter we also benefited from an early sale season for the flu vaccine. In summary I am pleased with the solid performance of Distribution Solutions. We have a terrific combination of assets that performed exceptionally well. That's why I feel confident about our momentum and our ability to grow in this tough environment and our ability to achieve our full year plan in these businesses. Turning now to Technology Solutions, our second quarter growth of 7% reflected higher revenues from maintenance and outsourcing and from our expanded customer base and strong performance from within our payer businesses. Operating profit was up 8% and we held margin steady despite a difficult economic environment. For several months we've been monitoring the impact of the weakening economy on our customer base. In this quarter particularly in the last two weeks we saw customers delay purchasing decisions. So while our second quarter results reflected growth, they did not meet our expectations. It's still too earlier to say for certain what will happen in the near term. There are parts of Technology Solutions that have been stable despite challenges in the economy. For example, we have a steady stream of recurring maintenance revenues from our large installed base. In addition, our automation business continues to perform well and this quarter we had strong revenue growth across the product lines, including robots, cabinets and our medcare cell. We gained share with both new customer wins and competitive replacements. We have also seen success with our RelayHealth business, which processes more than $1 trillion in charges and payments each year. And we are experiencing strong demand for RelayHealth financial clearance and settlement solutions, which enjoyed a record quarter. In addition, our medical imaging base has grown to more than 1600 unique facilities. And competitive replacements represent the majority of bookings this year for all imaging solutions. Our rise in cardiology has seen strong growth during the past three years from a minor presence in 2005 to capturing more than 10% market share last year. These products and service offerings are relatively quick to deploy and help customers improve their financial position. Earlier this year, we introduced our Horizon Enterprise revenue management solution. As you know, hospitals today are under tremendous pressure to manage their revenue streams in a world of complex reimbursement models that are too sophisticated for their old patient accounting systems. This results in a significant amount of uncollected payments that negatively impacts the hospital's bottom-line. Horizon ERM is designed to improve the economics of hospital care delivery. I'm pleased to report that during the quarter, Horizon ERM went live at Gwyneth Health System in Georgia. In the September, Gwyneth turned on the access management part of the product and is using it to reinvent 23 access points for registration within their health system. As we continue to roll out the solution at Gwyneth, we're also moving forward with our second pilot, which will also focus on revenue management portion ... on revenue management portions of the solution. We're making good progress introducing the Horizon ERM to our customer base and they are excited about the functionality of this solution. You've heard me talk about the tremendous difficulties that payer face today, they struggle to manage their medical loss ratios and manage their administrative costs. These are very complex processes that require sophisticate and analytics. McKesson supplies payers with solutions to give them visibility and transparency to the costs associated with managing their populations. A good example is our successful implementation of claims extent at Wellpoint's affiliated health plant in Georgia. Initially this will support over 300 million members and will help with their ongoing efforts to achieve consistency, accuracy, efficiency and transparency in claims processing. Another good example is the relationship that was recently announced with IBM to create an enterprise wide payer analytic solution to address increasing medical loss ratios. By combining our clinical content with IBM's world-class technology we will create a new solution to enable payers to facilitate smarter, faster decision making across their businesses. Despite these positive developments there are parts of our technology business that maybe more susceptible to the economy. We are seeing a temporary slowdown in some of our hospital solutions and physician office products. It's difficult to determine if the delay in purchasing we experienced in late September was temporary or if it will continue. Therefore we're going to take a slightly more conservative view at the back of the year. Given this view we are following a prudent course of action in positioning our technology business more conservatively until we have better visibility till timing of the markets recover. We are focused on controlling our cost and driving efficiency through our organization. In the interim, we are uniquely prepared to support our customers through this period of new technologies that can be installed quickly; and will directly impact cash flow and financial performance. Before I turn this over to Jeff, I want to touch on topics of capital deployment and balance sheet management, which would become even more critical during the past 6 weeks. We continue to take a portfolio approach to capital deployment, year-to-date we had deployed capital at about the same level as we did during the first 6 months of last fiscal year. Jeff will provide more details that we are comfortable with our balance sheet and our liquidity position. However we do believe that with the lack of visibility to when the financial markets will stabilize and the impact of higher borrowing cost, it is prudent to run the company more conservatively. We remain committed to using acquisitions and share re-purchases to further enhance shareholder value, although the broader economic environment could impact how active we are in the near term. We do plan to remain opportunistic but are mindful of the realities of today. We remain confident in the tremendous earnings potential of the company, driven by both distribution and technology growth. We are making moves now to take out cost where demand is slowing and to manage both the company and the balance sheet more conservatively. We believe this is a sensible course of action. Like all companies, we have to be a little more visible for the timing of the markets and aware of their recovery. Based on the healthy fundamentals underlining our business and our ability to execute on our objectives, we are maintaining our guidance of $4.00 to $4.15 per diluted share, from continuing operations for fiscal 2009. I look forward to reporting to you on our continued success throughout the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, thanks John and good afternoon everyone. As you just heard, McKesson posted a solid quarter in light of the challenging economic environment. We are confident in our overall earnings potential despite some additional caution around the back half of our fiscal year resulting from the lack of visibility into the timing of an economic recovery particularly, as it impacts our technology business. We'll talk more about this later. But let me begin by just focusing on our financial results for this quarter. As always, our first preview are consolidated results providing more color when I discussed each segment in more detail. Similar to what you saw in our June quarter consolidated revenues for the September quarter grew 9% at $26.6 billion and $24.5 billion last year. While our overall revenue growth is, of course, driven by the growth in Distribution Solutions was up 9% from last year, Technology Solutions posted revenue growth just a bit below this rate, coming in at 7%. Gross profit this quarter was up 10% at $1.3 billion. Distribution Solutions gross profit increased 12% providing nice gross expansion in the segment while Technology Solutions gross profit was up 5s%. Moving below the gross profit line, our total operating expenses were up 12% to $921 million for the quarter. Higher expenses in the quarter were primarily driven by growth in the business and the impact of several acquisitions particularly OTN. Operating income for the quarter grew 6% to $381 million and $359 million a year ago. Moving below operating income, other income of $33 million was 8% below last year. There are two things going on here. First, as we have discussed beginning with our guidance assumptions last May, lower interest rates and short term investments combined with our lower cash balances this year have resulted in a significant drop in our interest income. This drop is partially offset this quarter by the sale of our equity investments in Verispan. The pre-tax gain on the sale was $24 million and is included in the other income line. The after tax gain was $14 million or approximately $0.05 per diluted share. Interest expense of $35 million was relatively unchanged from the prior year. Now you should note that the expense associated with the use of our receivable sales facility is reported as an administrative cost in operating expenses and does not show up in interest expense. In the second quarter this administrative expense was approximately $3 million. Moving to taxes, our effective tax rate of 13.7% primarily reflects two factors; first, our run rate which remains at 33% that we've been using all year. Second, $76 million in positive discrete tax items in the quarter equating to $0.27 per diluted share which included the tax reserve release we had mention last quarter. Going forward, we continue to expect our run-rate to be 33% for the year excluding the impact of further discrete items. Net income in the quarter was $327 million up 32% from the prior year while earnings per diluted share of $1.17 was up 41% from $0.83 a year ago. The EPS leverage was driven by the impact of the aggressive $1.3 billion in share repurchases we have made over the last four quarters, which lowered our diluted shares outstanding by 6% year-over-year to 280 million shares. Year-to-date, our portfolio approach to capital deployment has resulted in net deployment at about the same level as we did in the first half of last year. We have spent more on acquisitions, $320 million as compared to $51 million last year and on our increased dividends $50 million as compared to $36 million last year. We have repurchased left stock $334 million as compared to $684 million last year. But this was some what offset by the lower number of auction exercises we have seen this year, bringing in just $65 million of proceeds as compared to $183 million last year. Obviously in the recent weeks we have become more cautious about the financial climate. And so you should expect to see us act more conservatively in our share repurchase activity going forward until we have more visibility into the reality of the climate in which we will be operating. Let's now move on to Distribution Solutions. In this segment we achieved overall revenue growth of 9% compared to the same quarter last year. U.S. Pharmaceutical direct distribution and services revenue grew 16% to $16.6 billion. About seven points of this growth stands from our acquisitions of OTN and McQueary Brothers with another two points coming from having an additional sales day this year. That leaves 7% growth driven primarily by strong performance across our entire customer base. Warehouse revenues declined 7% to $6.3 billion. As we've seen over the last few quarters now that the primary driver of the warehouse decline was the loss of a contract by a large warehouse customer coupled with decreased purchases from several other customers. Canadian revenues continue to grow strongly, increasing 15% for the quarter to $2.2 billion. While we did have one additional sales day this quarter, for the first time in a few quarters there was no currency impact on our Canadian results. So this performance is driven by our continued success in securing new and expanded distribution agreements across our customer base. Medical-surgical distribution revenues were up 9% for the quarter to $700 million. We have earlier sales flu vaccine this year which accounted for two to three points of growth, with the core business, growing at what we believe to be market rates. Gross profit for the segment was up 12% to $951 million on 9% revenue growth representing in nice improvement in gross margin of 11 basis points. The increase in gross profit for the quarter was driven by an improved mix of higher margin products and services, particularly sales of OneStop generics with some benefits also from the lower mix of warehouse sales. These gains were partially offset by the timing of when we received compensation under our agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers which in this quarter showed a modest decline year-over-year. As you recall, we talked last quarter about the fact that we experienced a stronger buying side impact year-over-year. So our June quarter was stronger than the prior year while the September quarter was weaker just due to a shift in the timing of our compensation between the two quarters. Year-to-date, these quarters mostly offset one another and our compensation is on track relative to our expectations. Our Distribution Solutions' operating expenses were up 16% for the quarter to $570 million reflecting growth in our businesses and the acquisitions of OTN and McQueary Brothers. Operating margin rate for the quarter was a 157 basis points compared to a 154 basis points in the prior year, of this year's result for this segment included the impact of the sale of our interest in Verispan. As you know, given the quarterly volatility of this segment, we always focused on full year margins. In this context, we remain on track for the full year to see modest expansion in the operating margin segment. In Technology Solutions, revenues were up 7% for the quarter to $762 million. Services revenues were up 8% in the quarter while software and software systems revenues of a $140 million in a quarter were relatively unchanged from a year ago. As John mentioned, we have clearly seen some of our hospital acquisition customers to foreign purchase decisions and this impact is reflected in the software line in particular. Gross profit was up 5% from the prior year to $351 million. For the quarter, Technology Solutions had total gross R&D spending of $100 million an increase of 10% from the prior year. Of this amount, we capped 17% compared to just 11% a year ago. Technology Solutions operating expenses increased 4% in the quarter to $282 million. As we have kept fairly tight controls on expenses, even in advance of some of the changes John talked about. Our operating profits in our Technology Solutions segment this quarter was $71 million up 8% from a year ago. Operating margins in this segment were 9.32% for the quarter compared to 9.27% in the prior year. Leaving our segment performance, and turning now to the balance sheet. Let me start by reminding you about our liquidity profile given the financially turbulence in time. We have a total of $2.3 billion in short-term liquidity facilities. This consist of a $1 billion account receivable sales facility which we renew annually each June and $1.3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in June 2012. Both of these facilities are lead by large money center banks. Historically, we have had access to short-term capital through the receivable sales facility and the revolving credit facility that I just discussed, as well as reselling commercial paper. As we have discussed in the past, we used these vehicles to manage our short-term cash flows which can vary significantly on a daily basis. At times, commercial paper is our best short-term borrowing option. When you look at our cash flow statement, you will see $3.5 billion in short-term borrowings and repayments year-to-date, most of which was done using a commercial paper market. More recently we have not had access to the commercial paper market, but we have had no trouble with access to short-term capital because we are able to rely on our receivable sales facility and revolving credit facility. Turning to long-term debt, we have no scheduled payments due before February 2010 when our senior notes for $215 million. Our cash is invested very conservatively, generally and over night government security back repos or money market funds. We have no significant derivative exposure that will expose us to counter party risk. Now to our working capital metrics; you will see in each of our working capital metrics the impact of timing, both in terms of the particular day at quarter ends and in terms of the pattern of our inventory buying which can impact both our inventory and payable balances. Adding back the $497 million sale-of-art at quarter end, our receivables increased 10% to $7.5 billion just a bit faster than our rate of sales growth. Our days sales outstanding therefore increased to-date to 23 days. We have not seen any changes in payment pattern driven by the economic climate. The added day this year is just a function of our customer mix and time. Our inventories were $9.2 billion on September 30 and a 11% increase over last year. And our day sales in inventory of 33 was one day higher than a year ago. Compared to a year ago payables were up just 3% to $12.1 billion, so our day sales in payables decreased 3 days from a year ago to 43. Year-to-date we have generated $51 million in operating cash flow excluding the benefit of the $497 million receivable sale. Slow relative to the last 2 years and was driven primarily by the timing of inventory purchases including the fact that we did some of our normal seasonal inventory build for the winter a bit early this year impacting both for DSIs and DSPs. There are also a few other pure timing related timing impact ... issues that impacted our year-to-date cash flow. Going forward, we continue to target generating over $1.5 billion of operating cash in fiscal 2009. Capital spending was $80 million for the first two quarters about flat with the prior year, capitalized software expenditures were $90 million up from $78 million last year. Our annual guidance for capital and software expenditures in the range of $350 million to $400 million remains unchanged. We ended the quarter with a $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalent down from the $1.4 billion we held at year end. So, overall our second quarter results were solid and on track. However, we have become more cautious about the back half of the year operating results given the current economic environment. This caution is translated into us maintaining our EPS guidance from continuing operations for the year at $4.15. Our caution about our operating results is offset by two non-operating items we recognized in the September quarter. Let me take you through each of these in turn. First, in terms of non-operating items, we are benefiting from the $0.05 gain on the Verispan sale and second, the discreet tax items this quarter came in $0.04 above what we had communicated to you as our expectation last quarter. As John discussed, we are more cautious in our outlook for our Technology Solution segment, given the uncertain environment for technology spending. Also in today's financial climate, we are planning on being a bit more conservative with our share repurchases. This combined with the higher cost of our short term borrowings and lower interest rates on our cash balances both lower our back half earnings. So the gain from the Verispan sale and the discreet tax benefits are tempered by the cautious tone of the latter two items which leaves us maintaining our guidance. Our cautious tone for the Technology Solutions segment particularly applies for the December quarter. Overall, as is historically the case, and as we've discussed all year, we expect the March quarter to be our strongest quarter. In conclusion, we feel that McKesson is well positioned with a current difficult environment. Thanks and with that, I turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Question And Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today will come from Tom Gallucci. Please state your company name and then you may ask your question.
Thomas Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Merrill Lynch. Good evening everybody. Two quick questions here, first in the IT business, you talked about reducing cost trying to be more efficient. Can you give us some ideas how flexible that business really is and the types of things you can do? And then the second one is just a quick one. You said you built inventory a little earlier this year. Given the credit environment, you seem to be spending a bit less on buybacks and things but you built inventory early, so any reasoning there would be helpful. Thank you?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Tom for the question. I'll take the IT question and ask Jeff to comment a little bit about inventory. Clearly, the first thing we could do really companywide is to crank back on some of our discretionary spend, things like travel and other kinds of activities that will hopefully have nominal effect on sales, but that have a big effect on expense are places we'll go to first. In the Technology Business in particular, we're not likely to touch any of our development activities or any of the things that have a long term paybacks. But in some areas where customers may not be ramping up to their deployments on products, our implementations because they're trying to reduce their own costs or in areas where they maybe shifting their purchases of one product to another, and we could reorient our organization in a different direction. And in some places we may have some more cost reductions. So I think we will be able to effectively offset some of the change in demand here, clearly we're not likely to get the kind of margin expansion we had hoped for in the IT business this year. But we still expect to get positive leverage in both of our businesses. And I think one of the real positive things that Jeff mentioned, definitely when he was talking about Distribution Solutions in fact on a full year basis, we still expect to get margin lift. And if you look at our sales rate in that business, it is very strong. So if we get margin lift on a business that's going that well in sales, we're going to get greater earning throughput the last half of this year, particularly the fourth quarter. So, we're still excited about that business in particular and how it's positioned.
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And Tom, on the inventory side, there's really quite a number of factors that go into this both in terms of manufacturers and their own production patterns, incentives they offer depending on when we buy certain inventory, really we have some of the same factors on the customers side; where customers buy in different patterns, and we are constantly evolving our relationship with customers. Those all happen to come together as of September 30th to give you the results we had this year which caused us to use a little bit more cash on inventory than we usually do on the first six months of the year, as I said as we look out for rest of the year we would expect those things to reverse and wouldn't necessarily see it as indicative of how the rest of year will ... well progress.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Next question, please
Operator: Thank you. Lisa Gill, please state your company name and you may ask your question.
Lisa Gill - J.P. Morgan: Okay. Good afternoon. It's J. P. Morgan. Jeff thank you for all the detail on the guidance. I'm just wondering if maybe you could just give us some idea as to why the guidance range remains so wide, at $4 ... just $4.15 maybe just some thoughts on what's on the upper end and the lower end of your guidance? And then secondly John, when you talked about generics and you talked about providing value to your customers, do you believe that in this economic slowdown, we'll see more utilization of generics, so could that be a great driver for you and opportunities around some of these additional customers or is it just additional penetration into the existing customer base. Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Lisa. Let me take the second question first and then Jeff can comment on the guidance. First of all the set up for the guidance, I think clearly, we're trying to be cautionary about the Technology Business. Time will tell us as to how concerned we should be or need to be about that business. And clearly, the products that we're selling have high demand and we're very optimistic that customers will need to buy these products. And once these financial markets settle out they will begin to sign those orders. So part of the range is gee, how much are they going to buy and how soon are they going to buy, is part of that question. And there are other factors that Jeff will cover. On the generic side I do think that customers are going to be much more sensitive to the purchase of generics. I think the transitions have already been very robust relative to brand to generic switches. So that will accelerate as well. I think people will just ... anyway that they can get to the generic faster they're going to do it. McKesson has a great track record of delivering generics to our retail customers. As soon as anybody gets in the market our customers get them, so I think that's real positive. And really the last point and the highlight of many of the comments I made on this call and on the previous calls, the adoption rate of McKesson's generic programs continues to accelerate and I think that's a sign that we're doing a great job for our customers and our costumers are finding that not only are we more efficient but we get them better economics in that entire transaction. So I remained very bullish on both Distribution
Lisa Gill - J.P. Morgan: But just a follow-up to that John, I mean we're very early in the stages of this economic downturn are you already starting to see some, just a prescription trend basis more generic utilization at the hospital level at the chain pharmacies long term care et cetera, or is it just that you're seeing the opportunity because you're penetrating your account. I'm just trying to understand where each of the pieces are coming from?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I think it's probably difficult for us to see the dispensing activity with the kind of clarity that a retailer might see, but clearly our pull through of generics is expanding and increasing. So I would say we'll probably get in a combination of more generics at the retail and but certainly more retailers and hospitals choosing to buy their generics from us and that's a big part of the equation for us.
Lisa Gill - J.P. Morgan: Okay great.
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And Lisa on the guidance, I think actually historically for this time of the year we're not particularly any wider in the range than we have been historically. There are really two sets of big uncertainties, you've got the uncertainty about IT area which John talked about and we're just trying to be prudent and cautious in our forward comments. And frankly we had uncertainty in the capital markets area, so our short-term borrowing costs have spiked up and frankly the interest income we get off sticking cash and overnight government back repos has gone down quite a little bit. We are also, not quite sure when the longer term capital markets will open up and when and how much we'll feel comfortable really opening up this biggest on share repurchase. So, those are really the big drivers of why I feel.... I certainly feel more comfortable with a little wider range as we go into the rest of the year. I would say in the Distribution Solution segment I feel pretty confident of our results and you don't have the kind of uncertainty there that you do probably in these the two areas.
Lisa Gill - J.P. Morgan: Okay. That's very helpful. And I guess this as a follow-up to that though, Jeff you don't believe that we'll see any changes in utilization patterns, and should we see unemployment go up dramatically from where it is today. And that does have anything to do with the current guidance range?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It really does and I guess a couple of points I'd make is those affects tend to happen over a period of time and where couple of steps removed from the immediate impact. The second point I'd remind you of is, we're 150 basis points business in our distribution business. So short term impacts in volume, especially a very little impact, not zero but very little impact on our bottom line. We are much more sensitive to trend in generics, which I think it will impact people moving in our direction and to what happened to our compensation from the branded manufacturers.
Lisa Gill - J.P. Morgan: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Glen Santangelo, please state your company name and you may ask your question.
Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse-North America: Yes, thanks, it's Credit Suisse. Hey, Jeff, I just want to follow-up on one more guidance question. It kind of seems like you maintain the guidance, but now you're including an additional $0.09 of those two items that you outlined. Could you maybe give us a sense for how much you intend to scale back your share repurchasing and maybe how much less interest income you have. I am trying to get a sense for how you really changing you projections on IT versus how you intend to deploy your cash?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well you're correct Glen, at $0.09 it's really the number you're solving for and the biggest piece of that is our conservatism or our caution around the Technology Solutions business. The... certainly we don't give guidance on exactly how much share repurchase we're going to do, but I'd say through a combination of being or making some assumptions around higher interest rates on our borrowings, lower interest rates on our investments and a little less share repurchase you'll get a couple of cents $0.02 to $0.04 and the rest is probably somewhere in the technology business.
Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse-North America: Okay, and thanks. And maybe if I could just ask one more follow-up question for John with respect to the balance sheet, obviously compared to a lot of your competitors your balance sheets are in a lot better shape and it seems like you're taking a little bit more of a conservative turn here in terms of deploying that cash. How do you think about your priorities as you move into 2009 with respect to maybe acquisitions as valuations in the marketplace maybe down compared to your own stock, which is out of single-digit PE multiple, which we've never seen before.
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Glen, I think it's clear that we have a great balance sheet going into this environment and it's also clear that there are many opportunities that are much more affordable to us including the repurchase of our own shares. I think the phenomenon we're describing we believe is a relatively sort term phenomenon and we don't expect the markets will stay in this kind of credit condition for the long haul. So I think that we have the sort of tamper our discussion by short term versus long term and the problem is the definition of those two, the tales of both of those statements. I think that our view is that we will continue the use the portfolio approach to capital deployment, we will continue to use share repurchases, we'll continue to be opportunistic in acquisitions and obviously we've already doubled our dividend and we continue to pay it. So I think your point is right, we're in a great position and we should be in a position to take advantage in this marketplace.
Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse-North America: Okay and thank you.
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: Larry Marsh, please state your company name and you may ask your question.
Larry Marsh - Barclays Capital: Thanks, Barclays Capital. For the record... one of the goals I guess that John I wanted to get your comment on, that the Paul Julian highlighted at the Analyst Day this past year was to retain 100% of your key customers this fiscal year. I just check in is that still on track and how do you think about in terms of customer renewals given the economic environment and just even more broadly, how do you even think about things like customer receivables reserves when the environment is so challenging on the distribution side?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, it's clear that from a track record perspective we've done a great job of retaining our customers and we generally retain our customers. And our goal is always to retain a 100% of the customers and I might refine just a little bit. 100% of the customers we want and so sometimes we get into the positions where we maybe in a place where the returns are where we want them to be, or we have other reasons that cause us to move in a different direction. But overall, I'd say that we're on track for the renewals that we expect this year and our teams continue to work very closely with our customers to earn the privilege of continuing to service their needs. And there is... as there are typically is very little sort of customer churn in our industry, on occasion clearly that you have some movement, but it typically is not really across the board. As it relates to receivables, we're working very closely with our customers and I would say, out of all of our businesses, our pharmaceutical distribution business probably does the best job of maintaining visibility to receivable risk and managing the collection process and we have very little customer delinquency in that business. Very little age receivable and I think we feel pretty comfortable with the kind of small reserves we have on our books for receivables are adequate. So, our largest receivables, from our largest customers are continued to be paid on time and we have very close working relationships with them, and a very close dialogue. So I think it's sort of steady as it goes clearly we have to be aware in this environment of the credit issues our customers may face, and we need to be prudent about new business we bring on and how we manage existing business and contract renewals. But I think at this point, we are sort of fairly as she goes.
Larry Marsh - Barclays Capital: And just a quick clarification, when you talk about sort of your more cautious view of technology business, and suggest that the timing delay maybe temporary. When you think about that, John, are there sort of gaining factors, is it an access to capital issue. Where you heard about early this year with the auction rate securities, is it impairment of current capital or is it really a change in the business environment for your customers that sort of, that dealt in terms of temporary versus a more permanent change?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I am not sure that we know clearly at across the board, what it is today or where it's ultimately going to go. I would say first off that our technology is really the solution to many of the problems our customers face. So I think, in my mind, it's not a question of if they buy our stock, it's a question of when they buy our stock. I think they may put off a new wing on the hospital the rehab to the emergency department that they are going to have to put in systems to reduce, so we will make their labor for more efficient and to reduce errors and some of this is going to be mandated through government regulations that have already been passed around error reductions in hospitals and not being paid for rework associated with errors and some of this is going to be simply the great return on the capital they get when they invest in our systems. That being said, I think the snapshot we had at the end of the quarter was just fear induced. I mean, customers, if they haven't purchased the system, I'm sure that CEO and CFO looked at each other and said we probably can wait another couple of weeks to sign this PO even though it's been approved up through our Board. And I think some of that occurred. And so I think that fear, that uncertainty are opening up the Wall Street Journal everyday cause people to have an immediate kind of pullback to some degree and some settings. I think the reality is what happened in the marketplace relative to access to credit, which I think has temporarily, probably caused some more people, to sit back and maybe not finish those signatures. And I think over the long term, the financial condition of our customers may deteriorate slightly. But I think the demands are still there and I think that the reimbursement team that are likely to come up with the next administration are unlikely to negatively affect our customers in such a way that they can't afford to do any systems purchases. So I think it was the immediate first blush Larry was wow, I think I have to stop doing what I am doing for a moment and take a breath. And then after that it's probably a process of working through their own analysis of their balance sheets?
Larry Marsh - Barclays Capital: Yes, very good. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Eric Coldwell, please state your company name and you may ask your question.
Eric Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co.: Thanks, it's Robert W. Baird. I have two questions. The first one is brief, John or Jeff can we quantify the growth of OneStop generics excluding the transition of McQueary accounts?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I think most of that was non McQueary. McQueary really hasn't started yet. I'm trying to read lips here. I don't think McQueary is really rolled in. We haven't started it. We converted it to our distribution center network and that integration has been done. But the real selling process to move into our generics really has not happened yet. So, I think what you're seeing is the uptick of our existing customers ... I will not remind you, we did buy D&K, a year ago ... a year and a half ago and that rolled through ... two years ago and I guess that roll through has already happened. So I think this is primarily net new customers I've talked about per mida [ph] and the fact that they came on with our generics. Last quarter I talked about safe way renewing with our generics. So there were some big wins in generics in the last couple of quarters that you're seeing evidence in our results.
Eric Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co.: That's actually fantastic. I was thinking some of that might have been McQueary derived. The second question is ... maybe a bit of statement, a bit of a question but I just want to make sure that we're all in the same page with growth, obviously given some of the comments about caution in the environment which I think are very, very understandable. As we look at the December quarter ahead, we're going to have a very tough year-over-year comp on growth, you are going to annualize OTN, once fewer sales day, Canada will probably go negative on the FX contribution and possibly materially so. You sold the Specialty Business or are in the process of doing so and you've also pulled some of your flu vaccine forward within earlier than expected start this year. Top line growth is going obviously be pretty challenged in the December quarter. Are there any other things that we're missing and how do we prevent maybe the market from interpreting some of these one time issues or comparisons or optics items from leading people to believe that the actual fundamentals of the core business have slowed even more than perhaps they are. Is it ... does that make sense or is it too...?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well I mean, I think you had a very good list of items there and clearly many of those items are fact based and we've try to discuss a lot of them and that's one of the reasons that Jeff and I tried to map [ph] the day in this conversation. This quarter, we tried to take out OTN and McQueary from our revenue number when I gave you a, sort of a same store growth number. And so I ... yes, our growth rates are going to come down. We won't have a 16% increase in direct store revenues in pharmaceutical distribution. But I do think that we feel comfortable that we will continue to grow in that high-end of the range for the mix of customers we have that IMS has provided. And I know IMS recently took down their range and we really don't see the kind of softening in our revenues that that indication would ... portray as is in our future. So I think we're still feel pretty comfortable, yes things are going to slow because we're lacking a lot of the stuff but we're still going to get a great leverage in our business. And Jeff?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And Eric just to put a fine point on it in terms of guidance, we obviously don't provide quarterly guidance. I would just point to you however to the comments I made in the prepared remarks that are cautioned about Technology Solutions particularly implies to the December quarter on top of all the other things you cited. And certainly historically the March quarter is always our biggest quarter and we'd expect that to be true. If you look at Distribution Solutions and you go back to last year's December quarter we also had some things happening there that will be more challenging as we lap them. So we feel very good about the back half of the year and the guidance we've given but it certainly will be heavily Q4 related.
Eric Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co.: I completely understand and pretty admirable results given the environment we are in. So thanks guys.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Great. Thank you, Eric.
Operator: Thank you. Charles Rhyee. Please state your company name and you may ask your question.
Charles Rhyee - Oppenheimer & Co.: Yeah, Oppenheimer. I just had a couple of clarification questions if I could particularly in the IT section. You talked about the slowdown of some of your customers, can you give us a sense on for the revenue cycle piece particularly in the Persay business, have you seen sort a slowdown in terms of the number of claims that you're processing on behalf positions in other words are you able to get any read on whether we're seeing a slowdown in physician visits, certainly anecdotal evidence would suggest that doctors are seeing fewer patients at least over the last couple of months. And then also just a clarification on the Verispan sale, obviously it looks like it comes out of the other income on distribution. Is that amount about ... am I right in thinking that ... did you say is at $24 million?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Jeff why don't you talk about Verispan?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes Verispan is in the other income line of Distribution Solutions on schedule two if you will, in our press release. And if you look at the consolidated income statement shows up in the other income line as well.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: And as it relates to Persay, that acquisition case continues to perform well for us. We actually have seen I think an increase in interest in Persay's revenue cycle outsourcing business which is the business that you referred to where we might be able to see some indication of slowdown at the physician level in terms of billings or office visits. I think people are beginning to say, you know what I don't need to carry the cost of some of these operations. So increasingly people are coming to us saying can you take on my back office responsibilities and so we're optimistic that we'll find even more opportunities in sort of this challenging time as customers look for things that ... to unload that aren't core to their operations. As to whether physicians are seeing less patients or whether demand has fallen, clearly there are some anecdotal conversations we have with people about cancelled physicians visits or scripts that weren't picked up or those kinds of things. But once again it's such a small amount of evidence that I think it's difficult for us to comment on it and in the scheme of our medical surgical distribution business or in our revenue cycle outsourcing business, sometimes it's hard to discern what was a missing unit because the patient didn't show up versus share gains that we picked up in our business or other kinds of items that offset those things. So, I don't think we're experts on physician office visit activity, but I'll tell you that those businesses are continuing to be very promising. Though you saw on our med/surge business, have good performance there and even if you take the flu vaccine out, that business is performing well and getting good leverage in its operations.
Charles Rhyee - Oppenheimer & Co.: Thanks for the comments. One more follow up question on distribution. We have obviously saw a pretty strong quarterly in terms of gross margins. We also had a kind of a pickup at least sequentially in the SG&A for distribution. Was there anything in there that might be different or that was sort of one time in nature, might not necessarily repeat as we move to back end of the year?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: What I would say that there's a bunch of acquisition and costs that still exists in those SG&A lines and so one, of the reasons that Jeff and I are remaining so bullish on the distribution solutions segment is that they actually look at the revenue rate and the gross margin pick ups. When we get those expenses down because we lap OTN and McQueary and some of the other items that fall into those categories, we should get good leverage back in that P&L and that's how we get the margin expansion back in the business particularly in the fourth quarter. And so that's really where we're headed and why are we optimistic. But you got to ... its got to start with gross margins and even if the revenue starts to diminish a little bit, if we can make up for those revenues short falls by selling more generics and get gross margins to grow which is really our focus, how do we grow gross margin and then get leverage off the gross margin to our expenses, that's a great model to grow operating income.
Charles Rhyee - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay. Thanks for the comments guys.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Operator: Thank you. John Ransom, please state your company name and you may ask your question.
John Ransom - Raymond James: Thanks. Raymond James. Two quick questions, all in generics if we take a typical generic today and kind of run it through the profit cycle, is there any change in sort of the diminution of the profit as you move from say 180 day to the Wal-Mart $4 model. Are there profits roughing [ph] for you anymore quickly than they always have or does it still look like about the same?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Actually the model is the same and I think that the big advantage we have is have is what's improving in a model for us is more generics and more customers buying generics. The actual way the profits move through it John are very similar to what they were before.
John Ransom - Raymond James: Okay. That's good. And just shifting gears to your technology business, what percent of that business would you estimate is hospital based versus physician and other alternate type base at this point?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well. I would guess that quite a bit of it is hospital based. Especially in what we would have called MPT, that is primarily a software business for hospitals and physicians along with our revenue cycle outsourcing business. Now RelayHealth is a transaction processing business that obviously sits above all of that and then you've got our payer business in there. So I'm going to kind of give it some quick relativity, but I'm guessing that we have somewhere in the neighborhood of ... our profits are probably half out of the hospital business and half out of the other businesses.
John Ransom - Raymond James: And when you see the slowdown, is it more pronounced in hospital or are you just kind of taking it across the board sort of the recent one?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: It's much more... it's really across the board but most of it is in the hospital and the physician business. I would say that the payer and pharmacy businesses is actually are growing nicely for us and remember the pharmacy business is the transaction engine and so that is really an issue of volume growing through pharmacies and the payer business those customers are large customers that are using technology to improve their operations. And so I think the biggest slow down we saw was really in the hospital business and obviously a little bit in the physician marketplace, but that's not as material for us.
John Ransom - Raymond James: Sure.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Hospital CFOs was holding up the TOs.
John Ransom - Raymond James: Well, thank you. And just to drill down one more step. Have you noticed any difference in behavior of say large investment grade hospitals compared to BBB hospitals in Blur if you've got that granular in your analysis?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I think it's a little too early to tell. I would say that... like I've said the first couple of weeks of this mess, I think it didn't really matter, I think it was kind of sporadic. You have some people to say, listen we're going to stop everything for a while and think about things and we had in the people that we're moving forward and I'm not sure that it was a necessarily related to their credit rating. But, clearly as we settle these things out, our larger more credit worthy customers are going to continue to advance the fall.
John Ransom - Raymond James: And I guess, the last question I mean on share repos what's kind of ironic and frustrating at the very moment your stock is roughly a nine-tenths PE, at a very moment this year pulling back from the market and you have kind of earned your self a pretty good balance sheet, I mean specifically, are you just concerned when the commercial paper market goes away, are you just concerned that you're going get a freak out in the bank market and you'll find yourself available your cash available to you at some point in time. What's the nightmare scenario for companies like yourself which really shouldn't have to worry about the things that you're trying to guard against?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well John, you should rest assure that we are frustrated by the puzzle that you have just sighted which is obviously with our multiples where they are, we would see that is an opportunity time to buy stocks. Now on the other hand, multiples are where they are because the financial environment is unprecedented and who would have thought, four months ago that you would see many of the events that we've seen. So, clearly the most important thing for our shareholders is that we manage the company prudently for the long term, that we position ourselves. So, that as John said our strong balance sheet allows us to take advantage of opportunities that are sure to arise in this environment but that may not mean in the very near term being really aggressive about buying stock.
John Ransom - Raymond James: Is it liquidity just specifically here just want to make sure you have liquidity to work through the kind of 1929 scenario?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
John Ransom - Raymond James: Okay.
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Short answer.
John Ransom - Raymond James: All right, thank you.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we've got time for one more question, operator if we've got it.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Brett Jones, please state your company name and you may ask your question.
Brett Jones - Leerink Swann: Thank you good evening, from Leerink Swann. Just not to beat a dead horse here John, but I just want to get a sense for how severe of a slowdown you really seeing within the IT business. I know you've talked about delays in the purchasing decisions and but I think it's the comment you made on the slowing implementations. Have you seen the slowdown really spread beyond purchasing and into actually customers delaying implementations. Thank you.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I guess... no we haven't to be frank about it. Yes, I guess the question is what will people... it takes money on the hospital side to deploy and to implement and it takes staffing. And so I think one of the cautionary things that Jeff and I are trying to talk about in a very transparent way is to see what happens if these customers don't have their way with all to implement the products they've already purchased at the timeframe that we have expected them to purchase them, because we want to make sure that we have an opportunity to understand that before we take away that caution. And as to the buying cycle, I think they are still very focused on making these decisions and you have most of our product champions at the customer level continuing to tell us that they're going to buy the systems that they're working on and our sales forces remain very optimistic and bullish about the funnels and about the progress of the product lines and sales cycle through the funnels. So, one of the reasons that Jeff and I kept a range wider than some of you may appreciate for the rest of this year is that, as we are closer and closer to the fourth quarter, we're going to see how these orders start to loosen up. And obviously, there's a whole bunch of this business that isn't order dependent and that's why we haven't, the bottom hasn't fallen out of our guidance. And if our... in excess of $3 billion in revenues there, there's a preponderant stuff that it is repeating revenue, that stays there in a steady state. Well over $2.5 billion of it is recurring kind of business in its nature. So, we're really talking about the high margin software that has a chance to move us upper end of those ranges that we've given you or not come in and that's really what we're focused on. How do we get those orders across the finish line? None of the customers have said to us, we're not going to buy them and none of the customers have said we're not going to buy the rest of the year. They basically just said, Listen we just want to take a pause here for a second and reevaluate our economic position from the balance sheet perspective before we make anymore major capital or commitments. And I think that's fair and I think it's probably proved certainly for some of our customers who have taken that position at the end of our quarter. Frankly, as it stands right at this moment, many of them might actually be moving through the bicycle as these markets begin to become more clear for our customers. So thank you for that last question and I want to thank you operator also and I want to thank all of you on the call today. We do remain very excited about our operating across healthcare and our ability to turn that into value for our customers and our shareholders. We appreciate your support and the questions you asked today. And with that I'll turn it over to Ana to give us some ideas of what we're going to be here in the coming weeks.
Ana Schrank - Vice President of Investor Relations: Thank you, John. I have a preview of our upcoming events. On November 4th, we will present at the Oppenheimer Annual Healthcare Conference in New York and on November 12th, we will present at the Credit Suisse Healthcare Conference in Phoenix. Our third quarter earnings release will be in late January and we look forward to seeing you at one or more of those events. Thanks and good bye.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect from the audio portion. And thank you for your participation. .

Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to McKesson Corporation Fiscal 2009 First Quarter Conference Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Ana Schrank, Vice President Investor Relations.
Ana Schrank - Vice President of Investor Relations: Thank you, Angie. Good afternoon and welcome to the McKesson fiscal 2009 first quarter conference call for the financial community. With me today with John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and Jeff Campbell, our CFO. John will provide a business update and will then introduce Jeff, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After Jeff's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour at 6:00 Eastern time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the Company's periodic current and annual reports filed with the Securities & Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Thanks, and here is John Hammergren.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Ana. And thanks to everyone for joining us on our call today. McKesson turned in solid results for the first quarter, continuing our positive momentum of the prior three years. Our results were driven by an excellent performance in the distribution solution segment where both revenues and operating profit were up strongly. As we discussed at our recent investor day The Technology Solutions business is subject to quarterly volatility but we are optimistic about our full-year forecast. We continue to use our balance sheet and our solid operating cash flow to further the creation of additional shareholder value. The overall result was steady growth in earnings per share and we are off to a solid start in fiscal 2009. Before I turn the call over to Jeff for a detailed review of our financial results, I will highlight the positive trends in our business and the progress that we are making to deliver sustained growth. Consolidated revenues for the first quarter were up 9% and earnings per diluted share were up 8% to $0.83. Our strong performance was driven by the Distribution Solutions segment, which still accounts for the largest part of earnings, and provides a great base for our Company. With the scale we've achieved and the efficiencies we offer in our customers, the Distribution Solutions segment will continue to provide McKesson with a platform for growth in the years to come. In the quarter, Distribution Solutions revenue growth was 9%, reflecting the strength and diversity of our customer base in both the United States and Canada. Distribution Solutions revenue grew as a result of solid growth and new business from existing customers, and the acquisition of OTN. Outstanding performance from U.S. Pharmaceutical continues to drive this segment with strong performance across the breath of our customer base. Our core direct revenues grew 16% for the quarter. While our revenues moved directionally like the pharma industry revenues our growth rate has typically been higher as we continue to have success in getting our customers to move more business through us as opposed to buying directly from manufacturers. We recently held our annual Pharmacy Strategies Conference for independent retail customers, where we outlined our vision for independent pharmacy as a health and wellness destination, not just a place to pick up prescriptions, and we unveiled a number of solutions that can help make this vision a reality. Today Pharmacists have an opportunity to elevate their role as healthcare providers in their communities. As trusted accessible healthcare professionals, independent Pharmacists are ideally suited to counsel their patient on medication therapy helping them manage conditions such as Diabetes, High Blood Pressure and Asthma. At the conference we demonstrated the McKesson Technology and Solutions work hand-in-hand. With technology providing gains in efficiency and profitability, pharmacists can spend more time delivering services that help their patients lead healthier lives. The conference served as a showcase for McKesson full compliment of solution for independent pharmacies. Many of these solutions are integrated for members of McKesson's Health Mart franchise, which grew 50% during fiscal 2008. Health Mart customers are extremely loyal to McKesson particularly with their generic compliance. Compared to the independent segment as a whole, our Health Mart stores have a 10% better utilization of OneStop our proprietary generics than the rest of the segment. We believe our OneStop generics program leads the industry in our recent performance supports that. In the first quarter sales growth for OneStop Generics was 20%, one again significantly above market growth. Because OneStop Generics is not a one size fits all program, we have participate across a wide range of customers including independence, regional chains, mail order firms, hospitals, including their group purchasing organizations, and long-term care pharmacy providers. We recently expanded our relationship with Safeway to include Generics except an additional 1000 stores in our OneStop program. This is terrific example of our steady progress penetrating our customer base with unique programs tailored for specific needs. We continue to benefit from our acquisition of OTN which gave us greater scale in the rapidly growing market for specialty pharmaceuticals and will accelerate growth until we lap the revenues from that acquisition. Bringing OTN into our family of distribution businesses provides us with a comprehensive value proposition for our customers and for our manufacturing partners. The integration of OTN is proceeding as planned and we should be complete by September. Beyond U.S. Pharmaceutical there was significant contribution to growth from other businesses within Distribution Solutions. In the first quarter growth in the Canadian Distribution business was outstanding due to new and expanded customer agreements. By focusing on long-term customer relationships and operational excellences, McKesson Canada has continued to be a leading distributor in Canada. We have strong market positions in our distribution businesses in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and through our joint venture in Nadrow [ph]. Each country operates a little differently, but we are able to make the strongest elements from each work together and exchange those best ideas across all three businesses. A good example of this is the recent acquisition we made in Canada. Of group farm ESAR, which is the marketing and purchasing arm for a network of close to 270 independently owned pharmacies located throughout Québec, Ontario and the Atlantic Provinces that operate under a banner called Proxim. In Canada banner is operated somewhat the same fashion as our Health Mart franchise and if they allow independent pharmacies to remain independently owned while achieving the scale and benefits of larger chain. McKesson Canada already owns several banners and the acquisition of Proxim banner fills out our offering. This acquisition demonstrates McKesson's commitment to the independent pharmacy business model, and our efforts to continue to expand our Canadian footprint. Lastly, in Distribution Solutions our medical surgical business continues to execute well. In the first quarter the business had solid revenue growth with particular strong results reported from our home care group, which has improved its market position with a suite of proprietary technology tools that enable McKesson's Horizon home health customers to place product orders to med-surg directly from their operating platforms. In summary, I'm very pleased with the strong performance of our distribution solutions segment. The scale and efficiency across our distribution businesses allows us to serve our customers with a high degree of satisfaction. With our successful proprietary generics program, we are set to benefit from the period of significant generic product introductions over the next few years. We've also enhanced our overall value proposition with the OTN acquisition, which gives us a strong position in the fastest growing sector of the market, specialty distribution. And in medical surgical solutions, our business is growing and we're executing very well these days. We have a terrific business and a stable industry, and I feel confident about our momentum for the remainder of the fiscal year. Turning now to technologies solutions. Our results in the first quarter don't reflect our full year expectations for the segment. Jeff will take you through more of the specifics on our first quarter, but let me remind you that there is quarterly volatility in the business that can impact the results on a short-term basis, but it doesn't change our long-term view of what we can accomplish. We are still very confident about our products and our strategy and we are optimistic about our full year results. Rights now, for example, Technology Solutions is hosting its Annual Executive Summit, it focuses on the role of technology in automating and connecting healthcare. The summit is for very senior hospital and health systems executives and even in this tough economy, we have a record number of first-time attendees. We include in the summit a series of meetings with our top customers to provide updates on the role of technology in overcoming current challenges in healthcare. We also provide industry education and the opportunity to network with peers to discuss common challenges such as patient safety, and uncompensated care. Our customer's commitment to this annual event demonstrates their continued interest in our solutions. As a result of our customer's interest when we look out into the future we see a robust pipeline. As Pam Pure told you at Investors Day this is a very big complex business and over the years we have succeeded because we have true expertise in healthcare and we have the broadest portfolio in the industry with unique solutions for hospitals, payers, physician offices, and pharmacies. To meet the needs of our broad customer base, we continue to focus on innovation and invest in new product development. For decades McKesson has been a leader in revenue cycle solutions. To maintain that leadership position, we recently announced the introduction of Horizon enterprise revenue management, Horizon ERM, a new solution focused on helping customers manage the very complex reimbursement collection and patient-management issues in healthcare. This new solution will run on Horizon architecture, and it is open, so that it integrates with both, McKesson and non-McKesson clinical solutions. Horizon ERM will better enable hospital financial managers to predict cash flow and net revenue by understanding the payment history of pairs and anticipated patient throughput. With this system, we're reinventing the way consumers interact with the health system and removing many of the administrative tasks currently performed after care is received to the front end of the care process. In last year's first quarter we announced the move of our health solutions business from the distribution segment into technology solutions to more closely align the development of new offerings that connect the needs of payers and providers for information and financial flows. This quarter I want to provide you with an update on some of the recent activities in health solutions, a business that provides commercial and government payers with software and services designed to optimize their operations and health outcomes for parents. Through McKesson health solutions we offer disease management programs and those three hour services to improve health status and health outcomes of patients with chronic conditions. We also provide business intelligence tools for measuring, reporting, and improving clinical and financial performance, including our InterCall criteria software for clinical decision support. In our payer business, all of our top 25 managed care organizations, and more than 90% of the Blue Cross Blue Shield plans depend on our solutions to manage their business. And in the disease management and triage business, our services are employed by more commercial and government agencies than by any other vendor. A great example of our ability to leverage expertise from our payer organization, and connectivity solutions from RelayHealth, and the power of our technology footprint in the ambulatory and health systems base [ph] was our announcement of community care advantage earlier this year. Drawing on our extensive experience in disease management for Medicaid patients and success with consumer-based technology solutions, we developed an offering to help meet the medical needs of the indigent, chronically ill, and newly discharged patients. The goal of this solution is to reduce the cost of serving high-cost populations by helping hospitals target non-reimbursed cost for readmissions, emergency department visits, and hospital occupancy. Community care advantage is a great example of our ability to use our scope and scale and combine our assets to help healthcare provider address their toughest challenges. On the disease management services side of the business we finished a successful first year in Illinois, with the largest and most complicated DM program in any state with 170 McKesson employees; nurses, physicians, and social workers on the ground, on the phone or in triage centers, helping the most costly Medicaid patients in Illinois. The result was that we decreased the in-patient admissions by managing those patients at home or in non-acute care studies. We are pleased with the successes of our software and services in health solutions and the synergies we have gained from moving this into our technology solutions segment. This type of broad-based success across our customer base of hospitals, payers, physician offices, and pharmacies, they keep us optimistic about the full year results for technology solutions. My last subject before I turn this call over to Jeff is the important topic of capital deployment. We continue to take a portfolio approach to capital deployment and in the first quarter we deployed $242 million in acquisitions, the largest of which was the McQueary Brothers for $190 million. In addition, we paid out our newly double dividend on July 1st. In summary, we entered fiscal 2000 with a strong performance and the long-term prospects of two businesses remain extremely promising. Our solid balance sheet and operating cash flow provide resources to further the creation of shareholder value. Based on the healthy fundamentals underlying our business, and our ability to execute on our objectives, and the estimated benefit of a tax reserve release, we are now raising our previous outlook and now expect that McKesson should earn between $4 and $4.15 per diluted share from continuing operations for the fiscal year ending March 31st, 2009. I look forward to reporting to you on our continued success throughout the year. With that I'll turn the call over to Jeff, and will return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, John and good afternoon everyone. As you've just heard, McKesson had another solid start to the fiscal year, driven by the performance of our distribution solutions business and the strength of our balance sheet. Let me begin by reviewing our financial results for the quarter, as always I'll first review our consolidated results, providing more color when I discuss each segment in more detail. Revenues for the quarter grew 9% to $26 .7 billion from $24.5 billion last year. Our overall revenue growth is, of course, driven by the growth in distribution solutions which was up 9% from last year, and represents 97% of our consolidated revenues. Gross profit for the quarter was up 8% to $1.3 billion. Distribution Solutions gross profit increased 14%, providing for nice margin expansion in the segment. Technology Solutions gross profit declined 6%, primarily due to our recognition in the prior year of $21 million of disease management deferred revenues, the expenses for which were incurred in prior quarters. Moving below the gross profit line, our total operating expenses were up 9% to $897 million for the quarter. Higher expenses in the quarter were primarily driven by growth in the business and several acquisitions, particularly OTN, as well as $9 million of additional FAS 123R expenses. Operating income for the quarter grew 4% to $371 million from $356 million a year ago. Moving below operating income, other income, of $21 million was 43% below last year, primarily due to lower interest rates on a lower cash balance. Given the current low interest rate environment, we are managing our cash very aggressively, and maintained a lower cash balances in the quarter. Interest expense of $34 million was relatively unchanged from the prior year. Moving to taxes, our effective tax-rate of 34.4% in the quarter was a bit higher than the 34% effective rate in the first quarter a year ago. You will recall that this year's guidance on our tax rate is for a 33% run-rate versus last year's 34%. This year's June quarter was above the 33% run-rate as it included $5 million tax expense for discrete items. Before I move on, I would like to take mat here to talk you through a discrete tax reserve adjustment that we expect to make in our September quarter. Let me remind you that in the past I have said that we do not include highly uncertain outcomes from settlements or other discrete tax items in our guidance. However, we are now confident that we will release a tax reserve in the September quarter of $65 million. Our outlook for the full year remains at a tax-rate of 33% before considering the impact of this expected reserve release. Net income in the quarter was $235 million, unchanged from the prior year, While earnings per share of $0.83 was up 8% from $0.77 a year ago. This EPS leverage was driven by the impact of the aggressive $1.7 billion of share repurchases we made in fiscal year 2008, which lowered our diluted shares outstanding by 7% year-over-year to $282 million -- 282 million shares. This quarter, our portfolio approach to capital deployment was more heavily weighted towards acquisitions. In the quarter, we deployed $242 million for acquisitions, million of which was for McQueary Brothers. We also repurchased a $130 million of stock which is little less than we've been doing in light of the acquisition spend this quarter. Its also worth noting that the cash proceeds we get from option exercises were down $119 million year-over-year this quarter. Let's now move on to distribution solutions. In this segment we achieved overall revenue growth of 9%, compared to the same quarter last year. U.S. Pharmaceutical direct distribution and services revenue grew 16%, about 6 points of which were due to the acquisition of OTN. That leaves 10% growth driven primarily by strong performance across our entire customer base, and some shift from our warehouse customers to direct-store-store delivery. This shift also contributed to our warehouse revenues declining 8%, but the primary driver of the warehouse decline was the loss of a contract by a large warehouse customer which we've talked about beginning with the March quarter. So we'll be done lapping this loss beginning with the March quarter of fiscal 2009. Canadian revenues increased 27% for the quarter. While a favorable currency impact of 10% and two additional sales days helped drive this increase, the largest factor was our continued success in securing new and expanded distribution agreements across our customer base. This is a great result. Medical surgical distribution revenues were up 6% for the quarter to $627 million growing roughly at market rates. Gross profit for the segment was up 14% to $934 million from $822 million a year ago, on 9% revenue growth, representing a nice improvement in gross margin of 15 basis points. The increase in gross profit for the quarter was due to the impact of our agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers and an improved mix of higher margin products and services including sales of OneStop Generics. We also benefited from the lower mix of warehouse sales. These are terrific results, especially given that we had $14 million in positive anti-trust settlements in the prior year quarter. Our distribution solutions operating expenses were up 13% for the quarter, to $562 million, reflecting growth in our businesses, and the acquisitions of OTN and McQueary Brothers. Operating margin rate for the quarter was 148 basis points, compared to 143 basis points in the prior year. Truly impressive when taking in to account last year's favorable $14 billion in anti-trust settlements. In summary, and before I move to Technology Solutions, we are very pleased with the revenue growth and margin expansion of our businesses within Distribution Solutions. We are off to a great start for the fiscal year in this segment, and I am optimistic about the fiscal year outlook. Turning to February Technology Solutions, let me remind you as I did at investor day, that in this business we have contracts that are implementation-driven, and software sales, both of which can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Last year, for example, we talked about our strong physician software sales, which were driven by regulatory deadlines that did not repeat this June quarter. Additionally, last year we recognized the $21 million of previously deferred revenue on a management contract that fell straight though bottom line, something that did not recur this year. With these factors in mind, our services revenues were up 6% in the quarter, excluding the $21 million from the prior year services revenues. This growth reflects progress across the board of customers we serve, and products we offer. Software and software systems revenue of $138 million in the quarter were unchanged from a year ago, primarily due to the strong sales of physician software in the prior year quarter. For the quarter Technology Solution had totaled gross R&D spending of $99 million an increase of 4% from the prior year. Of this amount, we only capitalized 14%, compared to 21% a year ago. We continue to innovate and spend on R&D to maintain our leadership position, and expect our capitalization rate to be between 15% and 20% this year. Technology Solutions operating expenses increased 5% in the quarter to $270 million. Higher expenses in this segment were driven by growth in the business, higher net R&D expense, and additional FAS 123R charges at $5 million over the prior year. Our operating profit in our technologies solutions segment this quarter was $66 million, down from $100 million a year ago. Operating margins in this segment were 8.87% for the quarter compared to 13.7% in the prior year. While the first quarter gets us off to a slow start, we still expect to make operating margin improvements in this segment on an annual basis. And to make progress towards our long-term goal of low to mid-teens operating margins. Leaving our segment performance and turning briefly now to the balance sheet. You may have noticed from our press release filed earlier this afternoon, that we utilized $325 million of our AR sales facility at the end of the quarter. As I mentioned before, given the size of our working capital, the fact that that we're churning through over $100 billion of receivables and payables a year, we have considerable daily fluctuations in our cash balance. As we have begun to manage our cash more aggressively in this low interest rate environment, we have begun to use your short-term liquidity facilities a bit for the first time in a few years. Given this more aggressive approach to managing cash, we felt it prudent to increase the committed balance available to us through our AR facility from $700 million to $1 billion. This AR facility, combined with our $1.3 billion revolving credit facility, gives us total liquidity support, $2.3 billion. Now to our working capital metrics. Adding back the $325 million sale of AR at quarter end, our receivables increased 11% to $7.5 billion, marginally higher than our sales growth. And our day sales outstanding would have been 22 days flat versus the prior year. Our inventories were $9.3 billion on June 30th, a 16% increase over last year. Our day sales and inventory of 33 was two days higher than a year ago. Once again, there are fluctuations in our daily working capital, depending on what's happening the day the quarter ends. But going forward, we do not expect this increase in our year-over-year days sales and inventory to sustain itself. Compared to a year ago, payables were up 13% to $12.4 billion, our day sales and payables increased one day from a year ago to 44, reflecting primarily the growth of our generics business which typically has longer payment terms. In the quarter, we used $11 million in operating cash flow, excluding the benefit of the $325 million receivables sales. This was driven strictly by timing of inventory purchases as reflected in our DSI, as well as a few other pure timing related issues. Going forward, we continue to expect to generate over $1.5 billion of operating cash in fiscal 2009. Capital spending was $40 million for the quarter, $5 million higher than the $35 million the year ago. Capitalized software expenditures were down to $38 million from $41 million a year ago. Our annual guidance for capital and software expenditures in the range of $350 million to $400 million remains unchanged. We ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, down from the $1.4 billion we held at year end. So overall, our first quarter results were solid and on track. Given the favorable tax reserve adjustment that I spoke about earlier, the solid first quarter results, and our confidence in the year, we are raising our guidance for EPS from continuing operations from $3.75 to $3.90, up to $4 to $4.15. On our May call we provided directional quarterly guidance, suggesting that our first quarter would be up slightly from the prior year. Our diluted EPS of $0.83 came in a little better than we expected, it was mainly due to timing. We continue to expect second quarter earnings to be flat to up slightly, and a stronger second half. Other than the above mentioned tax adjustments, there are no other changes to our fiscal year 2009 earnings per share guidance assumptions which we laid out for you back in May and affirmed in late June. We feel that McKesson is on track for another good year. Thanks, and with that I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator? Question and Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Bret Jones from Leerink Swann, your line is open.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Bret?
Bret Jones - Leerink Swann: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could update us, and this is probably a question directed at Pam. I was wondering if you could update us on the Horizon enterprise management. I think there were nine contracts for 14 facilities. I was wondering where that stands now? And if any of these facilities are running at different clinical system?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, Brett, Pam is not here on the call, so I'll attempt to answer the question. Horizon enterprise resource management was just recently launched. Is that the question you are asking about that product?
Bret Jones - Leerink Swann: Yes, but I believe you're still signing contracts even though it's going to launch in early next year, is that correct?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: But we're signing contracts, but it isn't up and being implemented yet. It's a in the beta [ph] phase.
Bret Jones - Leerink Swann: No, I know --.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: What was the question, how many contracts did we sign and how many more are we going to sign?
Bret Jones - Leerink Swann: No, no. The question was how many -- yeah, if you could give us an update on the number of contracts that had been signed, I believe it was stood at about nine contracts for 14 facilities, and now it's about a month, month and a half ago. And if any of these facilities that have signed contracts for this new financial system are running a different clinical system?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: I can't answer the question about whether or not they are competitive D installs [ph]. Clearly, we believe the product is well suited for both existing McKesson customers upgrading to a more contemporary platform as well as competitive customers who might be running other systems to use this new product. And the idea behind it really is that it will integrate much more effectively with the new clinical systems that we've sold, and perhaps others have sold. So we're excited about the launch, we are making progress and signing new deals with our customers but, I really don't have the specifics to share with you today.
Bret Jones - Leerink Swann: All right, fair enough. And then a question just on the gross margin within the technologies solutions business. I realize there was a disease management account that fell straight to the bottom-line for the year-over-year comp. But it was also significantly below the other three quarters of last year, and I was just wondering if there is anything else going on in that line?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, Bret this is Jeff. The gross margin bounces up and down a little bit, but the $21 million is the biggest chunk. And then the other thing is, we did have a spike in physician office software sales last year, given the regulatory deadline, and that stuff is sort of almost pure margin. So as that spike last year was not replicated this year, that drove most of the rest of the decline in the gross margin.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: And I think Bret, it is also important as we've talked about this business in this past as to look at our full year expectations on the business because we do see lumpiness in the business quarter-to-quarter depending on when contracts are signed, and more importantly when they are implemented, and how the revenue is recognized. We do things in a very conservative way here, and sometimes you'll get these artifacts of things flowing through that business in different ways quarter-to-quarter. But we're still very optimistic, as Jeff said that we'll make good progress towards our goal of low to mid-teens that kind of margins for that business for the full year.
Bret Jones - Leerink Swann: I understand but relative to your other three quarters there is nothing different in the mix of the business, then that would explain why it was lower than the other three quarters last year?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, I don't think there's significant differences in the mix. You'll see that they were more hardware sales in the quarter that grew faster than the other segments and hardware sales have the worst margin of the three so that's possibly is part of the mix. But business is big and complex. It has got lots of different moving parts in it. And clearly, software is the most profitable, and software's are off a little bit compared to the others as you get a little bit of effect. But once again on a full-year basis we are feeling very good about that business in the pipeline and tunnels we see in front of us.
Bret Jones - Leerink Swann: Great. Thank you very much.
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yep.
Operator: Thank you Robert Willoughby Banc of America, you may ask your question.
Robert Willoughby - Banc of America: Wow. It looks like 242 million of deal spending year-to-date. Can you hazard a guess what you did on the Canadian acquisition plus the IT deals that have closed since the quarter, what that deal spend and the aggregate might be at this point?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I'm trying to make sure I understand your question, Bob. So if you look at the cash flow statement, you see the 240 million in…
Robert Willoughby - Banc of America: Yeah
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: …Acquisition spend, I guess I'd also point out that there's other line, which has to do mostly with the pharma-soft deal that John talked about which actually technically closed July 1, but the cash was sitting in an escrow account, which is why it's down in the other category. McQueary we've been very public about the number that's a $190 million, and a couple of other technology deals which drove the remainder of the 242.
Robert Willoughby - Banc of America: I thought there had been some close since the end of the quarter. Is that not the case? That the incremental spend above?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, the only one that technically closed afterwards was the pharma-soft. But as I said…
Robert Willoughby - Banc of America: Okay.
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Its been in investing section in that other category.
Robert Willoughby - Banc of America: And I'm having trouble getting to the share repurchase number. You mentioned 130 million on the cash flow statement, it does way 147, so I was -- what is the disconnect there?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You know, it has to do, I must admit you got me a little bit -- it has to do with the tax treatment as people exercise options, is what my team here is telling me. So tell you what, that one we were happy probably to take offline and give you a little more detail.
Robert Willoughby - Banc of America: Okay. That's great. Thank you.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Bob.
Operator: Thank you, David Veal of Morgan Stanley your line is open.
David Veal - Morgan Stanley: Yeah, I guess just one question sort of a outside the quarter, I wonder if you can give us an update on the AWP litigation, how are you thinking about that for the balance for the fiscal year are we getting closer to the settlement? Is there a time at which we take a reserve for that?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we typically don't talk a lot about progress in litigation until there's something really to discuss, and we don't take reserves for litigation unless we have a known certain amount, and that would typically require an agreement between various parties. I can't speak to whether this will settle or it won't settle. I can say the only news in this case that release publish and official as the court as set a December 1st start date for the trial of the claims by the two certified classes in the Boston AWP litigation case. But I know you know that litigation is inherently unpredictable, and I guess all I can do is reiterate what we said from the very beginning of this case, and that is we believe it lacks merit and that our company has at it all times acted properly and legally. So we intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously. And that's all there nothing new since the 10-K filing ither than that December 1st date.
David Veal - Morgan Stanley: Okay great thank you. Just a follow-up for Jeff. The renewal on the AR facility was that accomplished largely the same terms as the one before? Or were there any kind of changes there?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, so we upside from 700 to 1 billion as you would expect in today's bank environment-- this is an annual facilities we've been renewing it each year for quite sometime, and some of the terms certainly went up a little bit in pricing. Now, of course that has to be balanced against the fact that all I'm talking about when I say that are the fees associated with the facility, which is, of course, a very, very small part of the actual cost of using the facility. So while the fees have gone up not insignificantly because interest rates are down 300 basis points year-over-year, the actual costs when we draw are down quite significantly versus the prior year. But, you know, the banking markets, poor large corporations like ourselves is a little pricier than it has been in sometime.
David Veal - Morgan Stanley: That's great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Tom Gallucci of Merrill Lynch, your line is open.
Thomas Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Good evening, two questions. One pharma growth was very strong versus our expectations, so wondering if you could just define a little bit on how you are driving such strong numbers especially relative to some of the market information that people see and I do you think you are taking any share? And the second question that we get a lot is how you think about Rite-Aid as far as credit being a bigger customer and sort of going through the time that it has been going through?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well thanks, Tom for the questions. Clearly we are very pleased with our growth in the pharmaceutical distribution business. But as you have saw in our result we have been growing our direct business in particular nicely, the direct-store delivery business. We are really pleased that how we're positioned in that business, and as we said in our prepared comments, we do think we're taking share of our existing customers spend that goes outside of wholesaling, we also think that some of our customers are growing slightly faster than the marketplace and then just a step back a little bit, the overall market statistics that are published by IMS and others have typically been directionally correct, but not absolutely correct. So that we use them as sort of an annual guideline in terms of -- as we look out to our planning horizons, but as Jeff talked about at our investor day, wholesalers as a group have typically grown nicely faster than the IMS so that market numbers would have indicated for lots of various reasons. So we are pleased with our growth, we think our growth is going to remain very solid, and clearly we're getting great leverage on that growth by growing gross margins even faster than we growing revenues and it's the best result in the margin expansion in our business which is one of our top priorities. And on the Rite-Aid credit situation, Rite-Aid has been a long-term customer of ours, and a good customer of ours, they have been and remain current with us, and we have a very open and frequent dialogue with them, so there's really nothing new to discuss relative to the relationship with McKesson and we're pleased to have them as a customer, we continue to work closely with them.
Operator: Thank you. Glen Santangelo from Credit Suisse, your line is open.
Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse: Yeah, John, and Jeff, just a quick question on the drug distribution operating margin. Obviously you saw some nice expansion there year-over-year, and if you back out the anti-trust settlements in the prior year the margin expansion was even better, almost 20 basis points sort of by my calculations. What is driving that do you think? Is it some of the recently launched generics, or do you think John as you suggested it's maybe more of the growth in the OneStop Program?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think it's really a combination of many factors. I think the, you know, generics continue to be a very important part of our business. Frankly I'm not sure the big generic wave was in the first part of this year, it is really coming later in the year. So I can't point to any specific launch that help drive our number. But we continue to manage our expenses very carefully which helps give us margin lift. We try to manage our mix in the business effectively as you pointed out selling more generics in to our existing customers and taking generics that they would have otherwise purchased direct or around us, and we also are focused on making sure that we optimize our relationships with the branded manufacturers, and when they have price increases we do get some benefits on that side as well. And it's all balanced on making sure our sales force that doesn't give it away on the customer pricing side and they sell the total value of your relationship with the customer. So our field teams have done a great job of demonstrating the value on a regular basis for our customers. Things like Health Mart and others produce more value for our customers than we ever charge in fees, and that helps us avoid the -- sort of the price discussion which is a big part also in maintaining margin growth is to resist the temptation to respond the pressure by dropping pricing.
Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse: Hey, John, maybe just one follow-up, if I could. I mean, you talked about Safeway on this call. In the past couple of calls you mentioned some of your other customers that used to by direct that are now buying their generics through McKesson. Is there some sort of catalyst for this change all of a sudden, or were they finally, you know, waking up to your value proposition? Any sort of comments on kind of why we're seeing a change there, would be helpful.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, you have been following the company for a long time, Glen, and we started this process of generics heavily investing in programs for our customers four or five years ago, maybe even beyond that. And it started primarily as an independent program, but as the snowball has grown and our book of business has grown, it has allowed us to create more and more value for our customers, and more and more value for the manufacturers. And thereby I would suggest that our value proposition continues to improve. So, whereby several years ago, we may not have had a program that attacked a customer like Safeway us to, today those kinds of customers are very open to the dialogue, number one, because they are looking for sort of the value. And number 2, our program stands up very well against their internal comparatives of what they can do on their own. So, I think it's a combination of the scale of the program, and the sophistication of the program and our customer's willingness to think beyond the boundaries of which they've normally look to wholesaling. And I think not only we're selling more generics, but more software, we're selling more services. We're getting more deeply embedded with our customer base, which improves their performance and frankly improves ours simultaneously.
Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Larry Marsh from Lehman Brothers, your line is open.
Larry Marsh - Lehman Brothers: Thanks, John, and Jeff. A bigger picture, John, really, on merger environment and the economy. Is consolidation of generic companies like we thought about this test be good or bad for you? And why specifically? And then along with that, I mean above and beyond any particular customer, what's the economy? Are you continuing to tick up your allowance for -- accounts in either business, you know, given the environment, and if not, why not?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, those are both good questions. I think mergers by our customers and by our suppliers has been a long-term trend. For as long as I have been in this industry, it certainly has existed. And we typically work very well with the consolidators on both the customer side as well as on the manufacturing side, and have close working relationships with them. We try to be aligned with winners, and to the extent that those winners produce additional efficiencies, the entire industry is better of, because waste is eliminated and there is an opportunity to turn that waste into margins for us in the industry. So, I think that -- you know, clearly the issue of making sure we have a fair price and a fair deal is important and to the extent that that we continue to use our buying strength and power, I think the natural thing in the industry will be continued looks for consolidations and efficiency. On the doubtful accounts side, we have no made any additional allowances for doubtful accounts of any significance. I think we see -- we see our customers' payables to us or our receivables very clearly. It's one of the strength. I think of McKesson's business model is very close management of our accounts receivable. And I think other than a couple of blips occasionally you might have that inflate and inventory number or a receivable number for primarily timing reasons. We really don't see a lot of bad debt reserve issues that we have to deal with.
Larry Marsh - Lehman Brothers: Okay, great. And I guess the elaboration for Jeff. Just a little bit by the share count in the quarter of 282 million, I know we don't -- didn't have period-end numbers, you know, at the end of March, but I thought you would give -- below us -- I know you had suggested that you were looking for 281, I guess average for the full year. So you are a good bit ahead of that. You know, is that some of the impact of fewer share -- stock option overhang? Or is there something else there that would cause the big drop sequentially, and is 281 still the right number to use for the full year?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, I think, Larry, of your question -- 281 is still the number I would guide you to for the year. There's, of course, a number of factors going on here. We did repurchase shares at a little lower pace this quarter than we have been. On the other hand that was a little offset by the fact that we had fewer option excises than we've been running late. I would also remind you that the lower stock price, lowers -- a little bit just due to the way the math works on the account.
Larry Marsh - Lehman Brothers: All right.
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: So, all of those things are contributing to what brought us to 282, but for now I would say our guidance still remains the 281 for the year.
Larry Marsh - Lehman Brothers: So, I guess, the point is we could see some sequential expansion in that figure, or not much of a reduction even though you continue to buyback stock?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, as I give you that 281 estimate, of course, we're making assumptions about a lot of things, including…
Larry Marsh - Lehman Brothers: Right.
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: …we're going to exercise options, what is going to happen to our stock price, and obviously we don't make predictions about our stock price. We have to do to some extend when I do forecast for accounting purposes, and we have a lot of faith in our forecast for the future, and in the performance of the company. So that's somewhat buried in the 281 assumption.
Larry Marsh - Lehman Brothers: Okay. And then, finally, just the tax reserve, you are, I guess, pulling out in the September quarter, 65 million, could you elaborate a little bit about what that is, has been tied to? And is there other, sort of reserve opportunities that you have in your book in the next few years?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, as you know, Larry, under the new tax rules that went in to place last year, FIN 48, all companies have a little bit more disclosure that is forward-looking when it comes to tax reserves when they used to -- and in fact, as you recall, when you go back to the 10-K we published a couple months ago, we have the required disclosure that says speculatively in the next year, you could have reserve releases up to a larger number. And I believe our number -- I don't have a 10-K right in front of me here, you can look up at it, it is around $120 million. At the time we provided guidance back in May, someone asked me about that, and they said gee, Jeff, is any of that in your guidance? And the answer was no. Because that disclosure is highly speculative because it still depends on exactly what happens in the future. Clearly, as of today, we're very confident that this 65 million will be appropriately accounted for in the September quarter and taken in as net income. And that's why we're telling you about it, and that's why we're adjusting our guidance to reflect it, but we are not -- anything that is still covered by that earlier disclosure -- and I'm looking at the number here, it looks like it was 100 -- yeah, around 120 million. Anything else that is in there would still be pretty speculative. And these have to do at all kinds of issues, we have lots of different taxing authorities all over the globe, and we're constantly in discussions. So this just reflects a number of those items.
Larry Marsh - Lehman Brothers: Okay, very good. Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Charles Rhyee from Oppenheimer & Company, your line is open.
Charles Rhyee - Oppenheimer & Company: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back to the technologies division for a second, and I understand everything, the comments you've made up until now but, my thought here is, my question here is that with Per-Se it seems like we've anniversary the acquisition of Per-Se. And if I recall looking at their financials prior to being acquired, they are running EBIT margins in the mid-teens if I'm not mistaken. Can you give us a sense on how the integration is going? Are we still expensing integration costs related to that acquisition in the June quarter here? And if so, how long will that might continue before we might see some of that sort of show up in the numbers?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I think that the Per-Se acquisition in particular has gone very well for us. And I would suggest that it is pretty well integrated at this point and the cost related to that integration are relatively minor. I might add though that we have -- we continue to make acquisitions in that segment and early on in the acquisition phase, even if some of the smaller minor acquisitions from a capital deployment perspective can provide some drag in an aggregate and it's not hard to get to $5 million to $10 million to $15 million wroth of earnings drag because of three or four acquisitions that are important to us in the long run, but have that effect in the short-term. So part of what we do every quarter is, we allocate our capital as we look for acquisitions that make sense for us, sometimes the timing of them pile up on each other and we have a little bit of that effect. So I think that your margin discussion around Per-Se is relatively accurate, and I think that it's been a positive influence on the margin structure of our business, and we are getting the value out of that acquisition that we had expected. On the flip side, we're investing heavily in our new enterprise resource management, our revenue cycle management businesses and we are investing heavily in acquisitions that are a bit of an offset to the synergies being produced by the Per-Se acquisition. That's really why we continue to focus on the full year expectations for that business.
Charles Rhyee - Oppenheimer & Company: Okay, thanks. And then one more follow-up for Jeff. You know, if I look at the interest expense in the quarter, and the quarter-ending debt, obviously, now some of this moved to your AR Facility, should we think of still your interest expense -- nothing has really changed overall with overall interest expense expected for the year?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Correct. And the short-term borrowing that we do is very inexpensive because short-term rates are so low and so it's not going to really materially move the needle on that.
Charles Rhyee - Oppenheimer & Company: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: Lisa Gill from JP Morgan, your line is open.
Lisa Gill - JP Morgan: Hi, thanks and good afternoon. Jeff, when you talked about the gross profit for the drug distribution business, you talked about three components driving at manufacture agreements, generics and less warehouse business. Obviously, we understand the generics and the less warehouse business and I'm just trying to understand has anything changed on the relationship side with pharmaceutical manufacturers? And then, can you just remind us what we've seen thus far as far as price increases this quarter? And what your expectations are over the next couple of quarters for price increases?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, all good questions, Lisa. Our relationship with the manufacturers, I guess I'll start with the comment, they're probably stronger than they've ever been because the nature of our more transparent agreements, and our performance under them is just a great, much better basis for the relationship. When you look at the strong gross margin performance, you see in that segment, you're correct, all of those things help. When you look at the branded manufacturers, there is a couple of things going on, we're working very hard to continually demonstrate that we can provide more value to the manufacturers, and you see that being reflected in our renewals of the agreements, and that contributes to part of what you are seeing year-over-year. And then of course, we still have a small part or a minority of the agreement where we have some dependency upon price increases, particularly with regard to the timing of the compensation. And price increases in the June quarter were fairly robust. I'd remind you that our guidance for the year was based on an overall price increase assumption that price increases would be a little bit below the prior 12 months and moderate more towards the levels that we saw in our fiscal '06 and fiscal '07. Now, we're only what, 90 to 110 days into the year, so it's far too early for us to comment on what the whole year is going to look like. But clearly, we're off to a pretty solid start on the price increase side.
Lisa Gill - JP Morgan: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yup.
Operator: Thank you. Ross Muken from Deutsche Bank, your line is open.
Barbara Ryan - Deutsche Bank: Oh, hi, it's Barbara Ryan. I actually had the same question about generic consolidation and its impact but, maybe since I'm on the line, you could tell us what your OneStop business was up in the quarter?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: That was up about 20% Barbara in the quarter which we think is obviously stronger than the market growth rate. It continues to show that we're getting more and more of our customers spend due to the program.
Barbara Ryan - Deutsche Bank: Great. Thanks, John.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Operator: Ricky Goldwasser from UBS, your line is open.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: Thank you. A number of questions. On the OneStop, what was the sequential increase in the OneStop business?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: I don't know that we have that number in front of us, Ricky, but we can try to dig it out. What were the other questions?
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: The other question is in your guidance for the year, do you assume any energy cost is maintained at current level or are you looking for some sort of relief later on in the year?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: I would think that -- that, you know, first of all energy cost in our business is a small amount of our total overall costs, and it is not one that is, that thus far has been from a change perspective has been very material to the corporation wall. In some of our businesses it's more important. We are doing anything we can do reduce our energy costs through lighting an HSBC kind of changes as well as transportation changes and we're also obviously trying where we can to pass along those costs to our customers, and that's an important part of our strategy. But overall, I'd say that our assumptions are that the energy costs will remain relatively where they are now. We don't have big assumptions about significant increases or significant decreases as we've set out our guidance for the year.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: Okay, and then…
John H. Hammergren - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: On this consecutive growth and we don't have the answer in front of is, if you can call Ana or something tomorrow that will be great.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: Yeah, that will be helpful and then just on the pricing side, you know, Jeff, you talked about the fact that you into guidance you factored in some inflation in the year anything that earlier in your prepared comments you said you are not changing your pricing assumption for the September quarter. Is what kind of effect have you've seen to-date in the quarter? And obviously we're very early in the quarter. Do you still expect pricing to be lower in the September '08 compared to where it was same period last year?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Ricky! I don't think we gave quarterly pricing guidance. And the comment that Jeff made earlier was that the full-year assumptions for price increases was unchanged from the guidance we gave at the start of the fiscal year, so our view is has remained unchanged, and our view as you reiterated a moment ago is it will moderate somewhat from last fiscal year back to the '06, '07 kinds of levels. So a slight moderation and I think that's still as we see. But as he also said, it's early in the year to call any changes there. As to prices this quarter, once again it's too early to tell, but I think things are pretty much on the plans than we expect them to be, and we're making progress, and we've got three more quarters in this year and that's a lot of runway in front of us.
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And the only directional comment, Ricky I did make about the September quarter was just to say that when you think about the EPS split over the rest of the year, we would expect the September quarter to be flat to up slightly and then much stronger EPS growth as we get into the latter two quarters.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: That wasn't really related to –
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That's -- yes, correct.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: Okay. And lastly when we think about anything that was said [inaudible] there was a question earlier -- when we think, really, about your ability to further penetration your existing customer base such as Safeway, should we think about some like more holistic approach that including both branded and generic and kind of the overall proposition that you give them that, rather than just looking at separately as on the generic side?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: When we sell a large customer like Safeway, and we did our most recent contract renewal with them, the generics were in addition to the overall contract. It wasn't as if they are contracted for in a compartmentalized way. It is an overall relation with the customers that we try to promulgate. And in fact we really don't sell generics to non-McKesson customers. If they are not in a big distribution relationship with us, our sales force and even our teleservice spenders are not marketing generics discretely as a value prop. It's part of an overall relationship, and that's how we continue to build the values. I think we're very focused on expanding those existing relationships and getting more and more of their spend.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: So should we view it of basically bundling of brand in generics to help drive the generic penetration?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, bundling is a word that takes on many different meanings, I think what I -- I guess what I would like to suggest is that it's -- it's a discussion usually with existing customers or potentially new customers in an all encompassing way that says listen we want to be your single provider of products to your warehouse, to your stores, to generics, branded, software potentially, automation, those bigger relationships are how we can really impact a customer's performance, and that's why we focus on those bigger relationship. If they leave us isolated to just brand distribution and outside the loading dock, there's very little we can do to effect the storage performance. I have got time for one more question. I guess there's one more person out there.
Operator: Richard Close from Jefferies, your line is open.
Richard Close - Jefferies: Great thanks for squeezing me in, Jeff just really quick, talking about the directional on the earnings with the second quarter flat to up slightly, that's prior to the tax reserve.
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, I'm sorry. That's an excellent clarification, Richard.
Richard Close - Jefferies: Okay. Just wanted to make sure there, and then John, you mentioned the pharma strategy and the independents, the conference or meeting that you had. I was wondering if you could just give us a state of the current environment with independents, some of the feedback that you are hearing? In terms of -- based on the current economy and all of that, and the level of independence that Health Mart pharmacies that you have now.
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, I actually -- maybe, it obviously is not a representative sample of the entire universe of independence. But our independence and particularly the Health Mart and value-add independence that attended our trade show, I think seem very optimistic about their prospects. I think they are excited about the idea of engaging in a broader healthcare discussion with the patient that's being paid for. So medication therapy management, that's not reimbursed and some other things that we're able to help these guys and gals step into, beyond just the dispensing of medication is a value proposition that they have been looking for and gets them out from behind the counter and engaging with the petition [ph]. I think the health of the customer base remains strong. Our customers in particular are looking to buy more stores and expand. Health Mart continues to grow. We're somewhere in the neighborhood of 2,000 stores at this point. And those Health Mart sotes are more profitable than their similar brother that are Health Mart. So we've improved their performance and improved our performance frankly at the same time. So it's a very symbiotic relationship. And I think one of the issues that the industry is going to have to grapple with in the next 10 years is the transition of some of these stores. So, one of the things we're really doing with our customers and I know our competitors are as well is trying to make sure these independence stay in the business, stay viable, sell their stores to other independents or to their friends and neighbors, or transition them to other family members that might be growing up and have a desire to be in the pharmacy business. So I think our ability to reach out to those store owners and help them with those transition that could take a decade or two is also going to continue to keep them a vibrant part of the pharmacy distribution channel. And we're happy to play that role. So, thank you for your questions today. It was great to have all of you joined us on the call. I also want to thank all of you that have been patiently waiting to answer -- to ask your questions. I hope we got to most of them. If we didn't then please call into Ana Schrank and we'll try to do the best we can. We remain very excited about our unique offering across healthcare and our ability to turn that value into great results for our customers and for our shareholders.

Thanks, and here is John Hammergren.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank, Ana, and thanks everyone for joining us on our call today. McKesson had a great fourth quarter capping off another year of excellent financial performance. For the full year we achieved a significant milestone for the company. Our revenues grew 9%, exceeding $100 billion for the first time, a terrific way to celebrate McKesson's 175th year in the business. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $3.31, excluding adjustments to the Securities Litigation reserves. That's a 15% increase from last year. Our financial performance and operating excellence provide great momentum for fiscal 2009 and we expect to deliver earnings of $3.75 to $3.90 per diluted share, which represents EPS growth of 13% to 18% from $3.31. For those of you who have followed McKesson for the past three years, you've heard us speak consistently about certain drivers in our business. They are the importance of our relationships with customers and our manufacturing partners, solid revenue growth and operational excellence which drivers margin expansion, and our portfolio approach to capital deployment made possible by our healthy balance sheet and strong cash flow. Each of these drivers contributed to our financial performance of past year and will continue to be integral to our financial performance in fiscal 2009 and beyond. For this call, I am going to take a somewhat different tact and review our performance in the context of these drivers in each of our two segments: Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions. Beginning with Distribution Solutions, let me highlight the strength of our relationships with customers and our manufacturing partners. We take pride in the value we deliver to our customers to create long-term relationships, and I'm pleased to report that our customer relationships have never been stronger. In Distribution Solutions this year, we resigned every US pharmaceutical top 20 direct distribution customer whose contract was up for renewal, including Rite Aid, Safeway, Cigna and Costco. We have a track record of renewing our large customers because of the comprehensive service offering and excellent customer service we provide. We constantly find new ways to add value for customers, and I'm particularly pleased that we re-signed these customers while achieving the tremendous financial results reported this year. We continue to receive recognition for outstanding service. In the fourth quarter, Kinedrug [ph] named McKesson “Business Partner Of The Year.” We also were awarded the 2008 VHA Service Excellence Award recognized by VHA members and Novation’s senior leadership team for excellent service and support of VHA's member hospitals. McKesson was the only pharmaceutical wholesaler to receive this award. These awards continue a long track record for leading service. You may recall in past years, we've received similar awards from customers such as Wal-Mart, and other large retailers. We continue to maintain the industry standard for quality while focusing on reducing our expenses to ensure we have the best cost advantage. We delivered the same high degree of service to our smaller customers as well. The results are evident in the growth of our Health Mart franchise, which provides our independent pharmacy customers with a strong portfolio of programs and services to meet their dynamic needs and approve their competitive position. During the year, we added more than 500 new Health Mart franchises, bringing our total to more than 1,900 stores. Through Health Mart, independent pharmacies participate in our proprietary OneStop Generics program, which delivers great value to our customers. In fiscal 2008, we executed well on our opportunities, and as a result, sales growth for OneStop increased 19% for the quarter and 11% for the year, significantly above overall market growth and clearly demonstrating our ability to penetrate our customer base. We believe we have the industry-leading generics program and OneStop Generics has participation across a wide range of customers, including independents, regional chains and hospital group purchasing organization. With such a large and diverse base of customers, we are well-positioned to take advantage of the considerable number of branded products that will lose patent protection during the next fiscal year. Our relationships with manufacturers of both generic and branded drugs are the strongest they have ever been. We are the singe largest distributor of generics in the world, which ensures that manufacturers will have access to significant market share through their relationship with McKesson. Additionally, we have the best track record for rapid and complete customer stocking, which has made McKesson a crucial launch partner for generic manufacturers. With the evolution of our agreements with branded manufacturers, our collaborations with them continued to improve. With greater information exchange, manufacturers have more visibility to continue to service customers, and therefore can plan their production accordingly. We have more stable and predictable compensation and working capital has been decreased significantly, resulting in a positive impact on our cash flow from operations. The strength of our relationships with customers and with manufacturing partners and some very successful acquisitions have helped us achieve above market revenue growth in Distribution Solutions. In fiscal 2008, revenues grew 9% anchored by the performance of our US pharmaceutical distribution business. US pharmaceuticals has consistently grow at or slightly above the market. While our revenues moved directionally with the pharmaceutical industry revenues, our growth rate has typically been slightly higher. We have continued to convert product flow that had previously gone direct from manufacturers to customers. Our greater efficiencies have helped us continues to gain share from regional distributors and from customer warehouses, and we benefit from the success of our stronger customers. When our customers win, McKesson wins. In addition, acquisitions have enhanced our value proposition in the US pharmaceutical business. The acquisition of D&K Healthcare in fiscal 2006 demonstrated McKesson's commitment to the independent segment. D&K was a natural fit for McKesson in terms of geographic presence and their business model and customer approach greatly enhanced and expanded our opportunities for generics. The acquisition of Oncology Therapeutics Network or OTN, one of the nation's largest distributors of specialty drug products, enhanced our position in the specialty drug category of the market. OTN and McKesson's Specialty each have strong value based relationship with physicians and manufacturers based on high-quality service and technologies that align clinical outcomes with financial incentives. The integration of these two businesses has enhanced our position in one of the most fastest growing categories of drugs in the United States. Beyond US pharmaceutical, there was significant contribution to growth from other businesses within Distribution Solutions, such as McKesson Canada, which has been a strong contributor to our success for several years and McKesson Medical-Surgical, which continued to make progress this year. In fiscal 2008, growth in the Canadian Distribution business was outstanding due to new and expanded customer agreements. While focusing on the long-term customer relationships and operational excellence, McKesson Canada has been able to maintain its status as a leading distributor in Canada. Our Medical-Surgical business continues to execute well and we are benefiting from its new focus. I'm very pleased with the continuous strong performance of our Distribution Solutions business and I feel good about our momentum going into fiscal 2009. Now turning to Technology Solutions. In this segment, we have also a great track record of long-term customer relationships, which enables us to sell new products and services into our existing customer base. We continued to see growth in our base one McKesson customers, which use McKesson to address multiple needs in information technology, automation, and distribution. We've talked in the past about our great partnerships with customers such as Duke, Vanderbilt, Spartanburg, and Atlantic Health. And one of our strategic goals in Technology Solutions is to create totally integrated systems for our customers that include software solutions, automation and distribution. On this call, I want to highlight our relationship with St. Luke's Episcopal Health System in Houston, which underscores the power of over One McKesson approach. For over almost a decade, St. Luke's has been an important development partner for many McKesson solutions. Recently, they decided to implement key clinical solutions, including the purchase of 300 medication dispensing cabinets to optimize medication management and the use of technology. St. Luke's is also a customer of US Pharmaceutical Distribution and is a great example of our One McKesson approach. In Technology Solutions, our focus on innovation has kept our software offerings among the best rated in the industry. McKesson's dedication to excellence is demonstrated by our consistently high presence in class rate rankings. In the past three years, there have been approximately 20 products ranked among the class top three. Our reputation for product and service quality continues to drive strong demand for our products. Bookings were up strongly in the second half of the year, especially in medical imaging, cardiology imaging, revenue cycle outsourcing, automation and RelayHealth. While most of these sales went into our customer base, we also had sales that were very significant, displacing products from our range of competitors. In our payor business, we have renewed or extended all expiring disease management contracts in fiscal 2008, a strong validation of the value we deliver to our customers. The governors of Illinois and Pennsylvania recently publicized the value of McKesson's care management programs for Medicaid populations. The state Illinois announced that McKesson’s disease management program generated a net savings of $34 million during the program's first year. In Pennsylvania, Governor Randall announced that our access plus program, which delivers disease management services to Pennsylvania beneficiaries in 42 rural counties, as a finalist in the 2008 Innovations in American Government Awards competition. On a software side of our payor business, in fiscal 2008, we signed the two largest contracts in our history with Etna and WellPoint. As a reminder, we serve more than 85% of the payors and continue to sell these products and customers... continue to sell these customers new products and services to strengthen our relationships. One final note of positive news in technology solutions, McKesson completed the implementation of its payroll and human resources information system for the National Health Service at England and Wales, with 586 trusts live representing 1.2 million workers. In summary, Technology Solutions has achieved solid revenue growth over the past three years reflecting continued demand for our clinical and imaging solutions, our payor software and services program and our more recent RelayHealth offering. The segment has also benefited from acquisitions like Per-Se Technologies, a leading provider of financial and administrative healthcare solutions for hospitals, physicians and retail pharmacies, and Awarix, which offers a solution designed to identify and help eliminate the bottlenecks that delay treatment and extend the patient’s stay. Our long-term goal for Technology Solutions operating margin is in the low-to-mid teens. I'm pleased with the progress the team made in fiscal 2008 by expanding margin 149 basis points to 10.7%. This includes the restructuring charges that we took in the December quarter. Turning now to capital deployment, the three-year trend of our strong operating performances in distribution solutions and technology solutions produced significant cash flow from operations that strengthened our balance sheet and enabled us to pursue a more aggressive strategy for value creation. We've taken a portfolio approach to capital deployment and over the past three years, we have reshaped the organization consistently with our evolving strategy. In fiscal 2006, we have completed a total of $3.1 billion of synergistic acquisitions, many of which were small tuck-in acquisitions that enhanced our value proposition to customers in both distribution and information technology. But several others such as D&K, OTN and Per-Se were important extensions of our platforms that expanded our offerings to critical customer segments. Recently, we announced three acquisitions that are also consistent with our strategy. The largest is our proposed acquisition of McQueary Brothers Drug Company, a regional distributor to independent and regional chain pharmacies in the Midwest for approximately $190 million. We also made two smaller acquisitions in Technology Solutions, Rosebud, which expanded our materials management and surgery offerings further strengthening... strengthens our leadership role in surgical solutions. Rosebud is a highly rated product that we can also cross-sell into our existing customer base as well as to non-McKesson customers. And HTP Inc., a leading provider of revenue cycle management technology, which enhances our RelayHealth customer offering. HTP further strengthens our position as the leader in using automation and connectivity to help customers improve their financial performance by accelerating reimbursement and minimizing bad debt. Our portfolio approach to capital deployment includes share repurchases. Over the past three years, we repurchased $3.7 billion of our shares including $772 million in the past quarter. Based on our positive outlook for the business, the Board of Directors has authorized an additional $1 billion share repurchase, which brings the total authorization to $1.3 billion. We're also committed to returning capital directly to shareholders. At its last meeting, the Board approved a new policy doubling our quarterly dividend from $0.06 to $0.12 per share effective with our July dividend. This demonstrates our confidence in the business and stability of our future cash flow. In summary, the fundamentals of our business remains strong and across the full range of our business, we have not seen the impact of a slowing economy or tightening credit markets. We had strong top line growth in both segments in fiscal 2008 And while revenues, revenue growth rates have slowed from the double-digit pace of several years ago, they remain solidly positive as we enter fiscal 2009. Despite continued moderating growth in the US pharmaceutical market as projected by IMS, McKesson is strategically well positioned to deliver continued solid revenue growth in Distribution Solutions. Our customers include some of the largest pharmacy operators in the United States and Canada with a particularly strong position in the mail-order segment, which continues to be a fast-growing part of the market. We've also enhanced our position in the fastest growing sector of the market, specialty distribution. Although, the trend toward increased generic substitution has a dampening effect on revenues, it has a positive effect on our profitability. Technology Solutions continues benefit from our broad portfolio of highly rated technology and automation solution that are widely used in healthcare. Continued demand for these solutions from our large installed base gives us confidence in our ability to sustain revenue growth at the high-end of the market in this segment. We have unique offerings for the emerging physician office in consumer-directed healthcare sectors of the market. With RelayHealth, we have unmatched portfolio of clinical, financial and administrative connectivity and communications solutions for hospitals, physicians and retail pharmacies. And our payor business is well-positioned with proven softer and service solutions. In fiscal 2008, both segments of our business delivered steady balanced revenue growth and solid operating margin performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year. A strong balance sheet and operating cash flow provided resources to further the creation of shareholder value. We're executing well across the company and we have great momentum as we head into fiscal 2009. Based on solid fiscal 2008 performance and the strong fundamentals underlying our business, our earnings growth progression should continue as we expect fiscal 2009 earnings per share to be between $3.75 and $3.90. I look forward to reporting to you on our results for the first quarter. With that I will turn the call over to Jeff, and will return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Well, thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As you just heard, this was a great quarter, capping of another solid year for McKesson. We exceeded our original EPS guidance for the year and carry strong momentum into fiscal 2009. We look forward to another year of double-digit profit growth driven by strong organic growth in our business. In my remarks today, I will cover both the fourth quarter and full-year results. As you’ve heard me say before, we provide our EPS guidance on an annual basis due to both seasonality and the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations that are inherent in our business. In this context, an annual look at our financial results can provide more meaningful insight into some of the key trends. And I will also comment on what these trends might mean for fiscal 2009. Let me begin by reviewing the consolidated statement of operations. We had total revenue growth in the quarter and the year of 9%, bringing our full-year revenues to $101.7 billion. Distribution Solutions revenues, which remain the primary driver of our overall revenue growth and account for 97% of total revenues, increased 9% for the year, while Technology Solutions revenue grew 33%, benefiting from the Per-Se acquisition and organic growth. Overall gross profit of $1.4 billion in the quarter and $5 billion for the year were both up 16% year-over-year. This nice leverage on our 9% revenue growth was primarily driven by the growing size of our higher gross margins in Technology Solutions segment. Moving to operating expenses, in the quarter, our total operating expenses increased 9% to $966 million, which compares to a 15% full year increase in operating expenses, excluding securities litigation credits. Our full-year operating expenses were higher primarily due to the growth in the business, the impact of our Per-Se and OTN acquisitions, $31 million of incremental FAS 123R expenses, and the charges we took in our December quarter. While we got a bit of leverage relative to the 16% growth in gross profit for the year, going forward, our operating expense leverage should accelerate as we get into the last half of our fiscal 2009 and lap the OTN acquisition. Continuing my walk down the P&L, our operating income was up 31% to $481 million for the quarter and up 17% to $1.5 billion on a full-year basis. Other income was down 35% for the quarter after being flat for the first three quarters of the year, primarily due to lower interest income. Our cash balance declined in the fourth quarter to our targeted levels, due primarily to our aggressive share repurchases and, of course, short-term interest rates have come down dramatically. Our cash is invested very conservatively, predominantly in overnight repurchase agreements secured by US Treasury or US Agency collateral, and we have very little floating rate debt. So, we are sensitive to short-term interest rate movements. I would anticipate that our fourth-quarter level of other income will be the new baseline as we get into our fiscal 2009. Interest expense of $34 million in the quarter and $142 million in the year were up 10% and 43% respectively due to the $1 billion in debt we added to finance the acquisition of Per-Se. Moving to taxes for the full year, we had a tax rate of 32.1%. This was a bit better than the future rate of 33% that we have provided as guidance for fiscal 2009, due primarily to the net positive impact of various tax settlements we reached in fiscal 2008. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was a $1.04 in the quarter versus $0.85 in the prior year, an increase of 22%. We had a strong performance in the fourth quarter on an absolute basis and relative to the guidance we provided last quarter. There was no one primary driver as almost every part of our business came in at the high end of our previous forecast. This is a great testament to our execution across all of our business and the great businesses that we are in. This is also our third consecutive year of having our march quarter EPS grow by more than 20%, a trend that we currently anticipate continuing in fiscal 2009. Our full year diluted EPS from continuing operations excluding securities litigation credits was $3.31 this year versus $2.89 of prior year, a 15% increase. To wrap up, our consolidated results, both in the quarter and the full year, our weighted average diluted shares outstanding declined primarily due to the cumulative impact of our share repurchases, including $772 million of stock repurchases in the fourth quarter, which brought our total share repurchase for the fiscal year to $1.7 billion. The sizeable fourth quarter share repurchases did not have much of an impact on our March quarter EPS but it will have a bigger impact on our fiscal 2009 earnings. Before moving on to our two segments, let me take a minute here to go over some of the aspects of our business that create fluctuations in our quarterly EPS results. As we look back on fiscal 2008, we're very pleased with our annual results and the fact that we exceeded our original annual guidance of $3.15 to $3.30 per share. Within the year, there were a number of material impacts on our quarterly earnings progression. Over the course of a full fiscal year, these factors tend to even out, but within the year they can create challenges when comparing year-over-year results on a quarterly basis. First, in Distribution Solutions, although our agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers provide a higher level of annual predictability for compensation, the structures of many agreements use price increases as the determinant of compensation timing, which we can't always foresee accurately by quarter. You saw this in the material shift of price increases between our September and December quarters of fiscal 2008. Second, also in Distribution Solutions and generics, while across our entire portfolio of products we are confident of meeting or exceeding expected profitability levels on an annual basis, we cannot predict with certainty the launch timing of any specific generic molecule, which can cause quarterly fluctuations in this increasingly important component of gross profit. You saw this in the lapping challenges we had in our September and December quarters compared to our fiscal 2007 results. Third, in Technology Solutions, there are timing impacts in revenue recognition both in software and in disease management. Many of our software and software services sales required customer acceptance to complete the earnings process and our performance-based disease management contracts require validation of program performance prior to revenue recognition while related costs are expensed as incurred. These two realities can cause fluctuations quarter-over-quarter. You saw this in our June quarter results, which included $21 million of previously deferred revenue for a disease management contract. This will create a challenging comparison in our Technology segment in the June quarter of fiscal 2009. Last, as for all companies, tax is another area where we see quarterly fluctuations due to discrete adjustments that we make from time to time. While these adjustments may change our tax rate from quarter to quarter, in fiscal 2008, for example, we ranged from 27% to 34%. We believe that our annual tax rate is a better overall measure of our tax expense. So the point here is that we run the company for the long-term. On an annual basis, we feel confident of our ability to provide guidance to our investors. On a quarterly basis, however, there may be fluctuations in our earnings that we will not always be able to foresee. Let's now move on to our two segments. Distribution Solutions revenues were up 8% to $25.4 billion for the fourth quarter and up 9% to $98.7 billion for the year. US pharmaceuticals direct distribution revenues grew 14% for the quarter, primarily reflecting customer growth, the OTN acquisition and a couple of customer shifting warehouse purchases to direct distribution revenues. The flipside of this last point is reflected in our warehouse revenues, which were down 10% for the quarter. While this is primarily due to lower purchases from one of our customers due to a contract loss, it was also due to the couple of customers choosing to shift a portion of their warehouse purchases to direct store delivery, taking advantage of our great service levels and working capital management. As a result of these factors warehouse revenues were flat for the year and US direct revenues were up 12%. Overall, our revenue results demonstrate that we are growing faster than market growth rates through acquisitions, our strong customer mix and by expanding our relationships with existing customers to provide more value added offerings. Canadian revenues increased 38% for the quarter primarily due to new and expanded distribution agreements and a favorable currency impact of 20%. For the full year Canadian revenues grow 21% and included a favorable currency impact of 12%. Medical-Surgical revenues were up 9% in the fourth quarter and 6% for the full year. Gross profit for the segment was up 15% for the quarter and 10% for the year. I'd note that gross profit in the fourth quarter included a $5 million pre-tax LIFO credit compared to $26 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. For the full year, the pre-tax LIFO credit was $14 million compared to $64 million a year ago. We have now fully utilized our pharmaceutical product LIFO reserve. Distribution Solutions operating expenses were up 16% for the quarter to $597 million and 13% for the year to $2.1 billion. Operating profit was up 12% for the quarter and 6% for the year. Operating margin rate for the fourth quarter was 183 basis points, up seven basis points compared to a 176 basis points a year ago. And it was 150 basis points for the full year compared to 154 basis points a year ago. Going forward, we continue to see opportunities to get leverage in this segment and to move our margin rate up steadily within our 150 to 200 basis points target range. Excluding the $50 million year-over-year decline in LIFO credits, the core operations of our Distribution Solutions segment achieved leverage in fiscal 2008. As we've said, the acquisition of OTN also reduced our margin rate this year as we worked through OTN's acquisition. Both of these headwinds lessen in fiscal 2009, which should allow the solid fundamentals of this segment to show through in an increased margin rate. Turning now to Technology Solutions, revenues were up 19% for the quarter to $806, million reflecting the impact of revenues from Per-Se and continued strong demand for clinical software and imaging solutions. Services revenues grew 25% to $596 million in the fourth quarter and software and software systems revenues increased 9% to $164 million. Full year revenues increased 33% to almost $3 billion. Services revenues increased 46% to $2.2 billion primarily due to additional Per-Se revenues and software and software systems revenues increased 10% to $591 million. We're very pleased by our revenue mix, the service component of which is recurring and speaks volumes to the sustainability of our business prospects. We continue to see strong demand for our products and services in the quarter and have yet to see a slowdown in our customers spend. Our software deferral rate was 76.6% in the fourth quarter compared to 79.4% in the prior-year; in line with revenue growth, gross profit increased 19% for the quarter and 32% for the year. Technology Solutions operating expenses increased 4% in the quarter to $288 million, and increased 26% for the full-year to $1.1 billion. Higher expenses for the year were primarily due to the impact of Per-Se and restructuring charges that we discussed last quarter. In the quarter, Technology Solutions capitalized 22% of their R&D expenditures compared to 20% a year ago, and for the year, capitalized 18% compared to 21% a year ago. Total gross R&D spending for the full year was $393 million, up 16% for the prior year. Quarter operating profit was up 89% to $104 million and operating margin was 12.9%. Operating profit in the segment, as in Distribution Solutions, is strongest always in the fourth quarter. For the year, operating profit grew 55% to $319 million and our operating margin rose from 9.2% to 10.7%. Now on to balance sheet, on the working capital side, our receivables are up 10% from the prior year to $7.2 billion and our days sales outstanding was up to 22 [ph] days. Compared to a year ago, our inventories increased 10% to $9 billion and our payables were up 11% to $12 billion. Our day sales in inventory of 33 days and days sales in payables of 44 days were up one day from a year ago. Stepping back, if you totaled the four key operational components of our working capital, receivables, inventory, payables and deferred revenue, we have just completed our second straight year of tremendous revenue growth, almost $6 billion of growth in '07 and over $8 billion in revenue growth in '08, while investing under a $100 million each year in these operational components of working capital. This strongly demonstrates the maturity and stability of our business model. In fiscal 2008, this model resulted in operating cash flows of $1.8 billion. This now gives us the comfort to raise our cash flow guidance from prior years. In fiscal 2009, we expect the cash flow from operations to again exceed $1.5 billion. We ended the year with $1.4 billion of cash on our balance sheet within our target range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion that we think optimal to run day today operations. Capital spending was $195 million for the year higher than $126 million we spent in the prior year due to higher investments in our pharmaceutical distribution network as well as continued investments in our internal systems. Capitalized software expenditures were $161 million for the year down from $180 million we spent last year. Overall, we spent $356 million in internal investments in fiscal 2008 and expect to spend in the same general range, $350 million to $400 million in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2008, we repurchased stock in the amount of $1.7 billion. As John said, given our strong balance sheet and expected strong cash flow from operations, the Board has authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program bringing the total to $1.3 billion. Given the shares repurchased in fiscal 2008 and this new authorization, our fiscal 2009 EPS guidance is based on expectations of 281 million shares in our dilution calculation down from 298 million in fiscal 2008. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio of 23% remains below our long-term target, 30% to 40%. We expect to continue our portfolio approach to capital deployment creating shareholder value while making progress towards our target rate. Let me now provide a few additional comments about our fiscal 2009 earnings guidance of $3.75 to $3.90 per diluted share. Revenue growth for Distribution Solutions should be at market growth rate, adjusted for our mix of business and the acquisition of OTN, which will have a positive impact in the first half of our fiscal year. You should expect our warehouse revenues to grow slower than direct revenues as we worked through the lost contract by our customer. Technology Solutions revenue growth should be at the high-end of market revenue growth. Due to strong demand for our healthcare information solutions and a continued steady pace of software implementations, we have now completely lapped the acquisition of Per-Se Technologies. Returning to distribution solutions, we assume that branded price inflation in fiscal 2009 will moderate from fiscal 2008 levels toward levels experienced in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007. We expect another year of strong growth in sales and profits from generic pharmaceuticals. We do expect the second half of our fiscal year to be stronger for generic launches, which will impact quarterly comparisons. Overall, as we look at fiscal 2009, we see our core businesses growing in line with our guidance. Given our fiscal 2008 EPS of $3.31 and our guidance of $3.75 to $3.90, this means 13% to 18% growth. There are some non-operating ins and outs in our EPS in both years, but they essentially net to zero when considering the year-over-year growth. At a high level, the way we think about this is that in fiscal 2009, we have some one-time and accounting headwinds in the $0.15 incremental FAS 123R expense, LIFO credits going away and 401 (k) contributions that will now cost us... that will cost us more now that our 1980s era ESOP has run out. In aggregate, these headwinds in 2009 are similar in size and essentially offset the $0.11 in charges that we took in the December quarter of fiscal 2008, which we do include in our $3.31 earnings per share for fiscal 2008. In addition, we have a significant good guy in fiscal 2009 from the much slower share count we expect, which of course we were able to do because of the strength of our balance sheet and our portfolio approach to capital deployment. This good guy is essentially offset by the much lower interest income we expect, given lower interest rates and the lower cash balances stemming partially from the aggressive share repurchases, along with the fact that our expected tax rate is going up from the 32% in fiscal 2008 and 33% in fiscal 2009. As we see it, our fiscal 2008 results and fiscal 2009 EPS growth of 13% to 18% is reflective of the operating growth of the business. And now last to the issue of quarterly progression, we do not provide quarterly EPS guidance for all the reasons articulated in my earlier remarks around our fiscal 2008 results. That said, at this moment, our best directional estimate based on the assumptions provided and the pattern of quarterly results in fiscal 2008 is that the June quarter of fiscal 2009 will be up slightly compared to the prior year, the second quarter relatively flat with significant EPS growth in the final two quarters. In summary then, we had a solid fourth quarter in fiscal 2008, have a sustainable business model anchored by great customers and expect another year of strong earnings per share growth in fiscal 2009. Thank you, and with that I'll turn the call over to the operator. Question and Answer Question and Answer
Operator: Larry Marsh your line is open. If you would like to state your company name please
Larry Marsh - Lehman Brothers: Lehman brothers.
Operator: Go ahead with your question.
Larry Marsh - Lehman Brothers: Well, okay. Thanks good afternoon everyone and thanks John and Jeff for the rundown and good results. I guess, a big future question mainly for John, you talk about the opportunities in the market to take some of this book business and move it to direct as you think about customers addressing significant opportunities does that changed the profit equation for your business, what would be the catalyst for that and sort of why there is any sort of fluctuation in that trend as you think about fiscal '09?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. To the point Larry, we are seeing a trend where our customers are looking for us to provide more service for their stores than we might have in the past, particularly on the warehousing side of the business. When we go to a direct model, we have more responsibility for service levels, we obviously have a bigger stake in the inventory and perform more of our customers and as a result we actually charge more for the service and make more on the service as well. So, we both have improved profitability as well as, I think, additional momentum with our customers and better engagement with our customers when we're doing direct store deliveries rather than warehouse business.
Larry Marsh - Lehman Brothers: Okay. But I guess, the question is, is there a particular trend in that business where you would see a major changes as you go forward?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: No. I think, it's better trend than we've seen for some time but we see it accelerating perhaps. And this is both the business that that may have done on their own around us as well as business that may be doing with us through the warehouse that would transition to a more direct store kind of delivery model from McKesson. So, we've talked about for some time, our interest in providing more and more service to our customers and I think that in addition to our strong balance sheet, our ability to manage generics, our ability to do things that our customers haven't relied on us to do in the past or increasing their reliance on McKesson as a value business partners. So, even with some of these independence that we have penetrated with OneStop Generics, they might have purchased around us their generic volume in the past and now they are buying it from McKesson. So, this more holistic approach is improving the value that we are delivering to our customers and also as a byproduct improving the profitability of the business on a marginal rate basis.
Larry Marsh - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Very good. Two other quick things, John, you highlighted your continued success in renewing your key customers like you said your top 20 customers where you have renewals who are all re-signed. Do we assume those for the typical multi-year periods and are there any particular renewals that you're now anticipating this year and I’ll asked... the same question I have asked for last couple of times, do we assume CVS' fiscal 2010 renewal?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. We typically don't talk about specific contracts. But in general, what you're suggesting is right Larry. We have about a third of our book of business expires every year. This are roughly usually three-year kind of a contracts and relationships. And I guess the reason that I highlighted them this quarter is not because... this year is not because they are really different than prior year. It's just that I think we do questioned occasionally by investors about the stability of the marketplace and are we worried about customer switching etcetera. And I think the best evidence to refute concerns in that area is our ability to continue to renew our business and the stability of these customer relationships. Not only are they recognizing us for our service and giving us awards and not only they have been with us for years and sometimes decades even in the most recent period and we have renewed all of those major arrangements. It's not to suggest that we won't lose a customer from time to time but what it is to suggest is that if we service our customers, we point out our value to our customers and we continue to deliver and obviously keep our pricing competitive with the marketplace, we will continue to retain those key customers going forward and we are really proud of what our [inaudible] accomplish in that area.
Larry Marsh - Lehman Brothers: Okay. And just a clarification. Thank you. For Jeff, you're calling out, while you're not saying specific in quarterly guidance, some participation and slight improvement in Q1 versus last year, I guess that's versus reported $0.78 per share, just to make sure I'm hearing that correctly. And then secondly, in terms of the share repurchase, do we just assume fairly a steady progression to get down to 281 million by the end of the year or is there any estimate in terms of timing that we could see a change in share count?
Larry Marsh - Lehman Brothers: Well, let me work those backwards, Larry. The share repurchase, of course, we never comment on the pace at which we will buy. It will be a function of stock prices and cash balances and interest rates and other factors still are the placeholder. I think you should assume a... you should not assume that the March quarter registered represents a new standard. I'd say that was an unusual quarter driven by combination of stock price and our interest rates. In terms of my comments about the quarterly progression, I think it is a good question and I guess I would make the point – all of my comments are basis of what we reported our earnings. Of course we reported our earnings on a GAAP basis. We focus on the numbers that's continuing operations excluding Securities Litigation. So that number last June quarter was $0.77.
Larry Marsh - Lehman Brothers: Very good. Thank you.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tom Gallucci and state your business please.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Merrill Lynch, thank you. Just two quick ones. First on branded price inflation, I guess what were the level that you were referring to a couple of fiscal years ago? Just to make sure we are on the same page there. Are you seeing anything specific that leads you to believe it would be a little less in the next year than the last year, or just being a little bit conservative there?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Tom, I think the level of price increase that is publicly available and discussed is probably different for every one of the people that participate in the pharmaceutical business. When we talk about our price increase expectations, it's really how we saw it fall into our business. And clearly there is some relativity. As whatever benchmark you want to look at is that rises, we're going to rise in some proportion, they are going to decrease, we are going to decrease in some proportion. So the purpose of our comments were really designed to give people a flavor for how bullish we were relative to price increases and to the expectations that we've delivered. In other words, let's you risk bound those expectations at least as in relation to price increases. So we look historically at how well we've done. When we plan future years and when we looked at this year, we didn't plan this year off of '08 necessarily, we really planned it more off of an '06, ‘70 kind of look back. And that was slightly less than what we experienced in '08. So I just didn't want you to think from an expectation prospective, we’ve put the pedal to the wall and then inflated '08 and kept going. As to our view on price increases this year, clearly, we think that the one we just gave you is an accurate if not slightly conservative view but each of you as investors will have to make your own decision as to where you think price increases will go and based on your own diligence. But that's what’s baked into the guidance that Jeff and I have discussed.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Okay. That's helpful, one more thing, you mentioned being sort of increasingly a launch partner for generic manufacturers. I was just sort of curious, what does that do for you particularly at a time when maybe people are expecting some more at-risk launches and how does that really help differentiate you versus your competition?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: That's a good question. First of all let me just make sure that everybody knows it that in our guidance clearly is expectations around generics but we don't really build at-risk launches into our go-forward comments and so we clearly map these things out and we work aggressively with manufacturers to make sure we are their preferred partner on their go-to-market strategy and particularly in environments where they might be somewhat supply constrained. They're not going to provide everyone in the world of generic distribution access to the same amount of products. So we try to... as a value partner, give them the ability to get the product to market quickly and to do a very good job for our customers and for our manufacturing partners and getting the product out. And clearly, in periods of exclusivity there is better margin available for all of us in the channel and that clearly is a positive aspect of what we see going forward.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Operator: Okay. Our next question comes from Glen Santangelo. And please state your company name.
Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse: Close enough, credit Suisse. John, I just had a quick question regarding the Healthcare IT business. Couple of weeks ago, we heard from GE saying they are seeing a slow down in hospital spending and obviously all the issues in the credit markets have been well publicized. You obviously had great results in this business Cerner did as well. Now you are forecasting a growth in the Healthcare IT to be at the upper end of the guidance range. Could you give us maybe a sense for what the disconnect might be there or what your hospital customers are telling you, kind of any sort of commentary there would be helpful?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I would say that, they probably start with several different layers Glen. First of all you have to have satisfied customers in very contemporary products. If your customers aren't happy and your products aren't what they're looking to buy and aren't working then you are out of the game to begin with. But, setting those obvious points aside, the subtleties in these are... really I think the biggers are getting bigger and the littlers are getting littlers. And the best of breed-fragmented approach to Healthcare IT isn't going to work. And a more portfolio approach, which we were able to deploy here at McKesson is a significant advantage for us. So you hear us talk about our product portfolios in our Technology Solutions segment in a very broad context. And so if hospitals aren't buying clinical systems anymore gee, maybe they are buying revenue cycle and maybe there is a physician market and a payer market and a connectivity business we can wrap around this. So, what was a less than a billion-dollar technology business several years ago is now a $3 billion technology business with multiple channels and multiple avenues to grow and I think the quality of our products, the quality of our relationships with our customers in addition to the breadth of our offering gives us a great opportunity to continue to grow the business and that's why we're bullish. And we are seeing competitive wins now from companies that we normally would not have been market our customers are saying, listen we see a go-forward strategy with you for the next decade or two. We are going to start building our platform out with you even though we might have an existing base of business with your competitors. So I think that increasingly we're seeing a transition to fewer, more significant players in the healthcare/IT space.
Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thank you.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Richard Close. State your company, please.
Richard Close - Credit Suisse: Yes, Jefferies & Co. Quick question here. You mentioned the 19% fourth-quarter growth in the one-stop program seems to be accelerating as we progress through the year. Can you give us some commentary around how you expect that to trend in fiscal '09?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we clearly are very optimistic about our generic business as we going into '09 and there are several things that fuel our growth, Richard. One is the continued expansion of our customer base. I'll talk about the store counts at Health Mart and other kinds of contracts. We have chains that are now beginning to use our generic program that might not have used it in the past, food/drug combos, people that would have had very robust programs on their own have now turned to McKesson to provide their generic. So, this idea of improving our channel of customers is a very significant fuel to our optimism. And the second thing that's a fuel for our optimism is the fact that the generic pipeline is expanding. So, you really... it's a machine with McKesson in the middle [inaudible] customers that are expanded on one end and a bigger group of raw ingredients from the generic manufacturers coming in the other end, it's a great place to be.
Richard Close - Credit Suisse: So, as a follow-up to that the strength that I think you mentioned in the earlier part of fiscal '08, people switching on generics to you guys is continuing a trend that is supposed to continue throughout next year?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, we certainly expect it to continue and it's... we're beginning to go beyond the typical customer segments that we competed in the past. We used to talk primarily about independence. On this call, you heard me talking about chains, you heard me talk about food/drug combos and you heard me talk about hospitals in the past. So, we do not feel constrained to design generics to independent pharmacies. We think we have a complete market opportunity in front of us and now we have a... at least a couple of year runway here of a great portfolio of new products going generic.
Richard Close - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thank you.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Operator: Ricky Goldwasser. Your line is open, state your company name
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: UBS.
Operator: Thank you.
Ricky Goldwasser – UBS: Congratulations for a great quarter.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Ricky Goldwasser – UBS: A few questions. First of all, when you think about the quarterly progression of fiscal year '09, what is the key variable in the June quarter... in the June, September quarter? Is it branded price inflation or are there other things that--?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Well Ricky, there is... the short answer to your question is yes. It's sort of all of the above. The one thing in particular that I did mention in my remarks is that you had a particularly strong bit of revenue recognition in our FY '08 June quarter in our disease management business that dropped $21 million of revenue pretty much straight to the bottom line. So obviously that is not something that we would expect to repeat in our June quarter this year and in general we had pretty strong June and September quarters in fiscal '08 and as we look at the range of general launches and timing of branded price increases to get the guidance that I provided a little bit earlier.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: But one that we know, Ricky is the guidance that we gave you on a quarterly basis is rough. That's why we don't give you EPS on a quarterly basis, but we wanted to do is provide at least directionally some sense for how we see it flowing the quarters wrong. When we think about it from a forecast perspective. We typically get the year right. We don't know absolutely when those price increases are going to come. We don't know absolutely when the generics are going to launch and things happen in our businesses like, Jeff mentioned where you have a product goal generally available and you recognize some revenue or you proved the case to the State of Illinois and you recognized income. All of those things happen in a year and then you try to compare it against the year prior that had the same variability in it and you basically compound the variability challenge that we have. So we remain very confident in the progression that we've given you and then the range we have given you for the full year. We just can't be any more specific than that.
Ricky Goldwasser – UBS: So. from where you stand today and thinking about the profit drivers that you guys outlined and I think generic introductions obviously is one, generic penetration off of existing customers, new customers and branded price inflation, with some of the information that you have today sort of the information that you have today, can you [inaudible] for us in terms of the impact into fiscal year '09 versus fiscal year '08?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I mean, we clearly, inside of our business, have the ability to look at where our profit drivers are going forward. Rather than getting into that type of detail on a call like this, I think the idea that we still get a lot of our margin from our relationships with branded manufacturers and those relationships are complex and individually crafted, we get a lot of margin from our generic manufacturing partners and the throughput and the timing and the ability for our customers to buy the products from us versus other alternatives they might have. And our ability to continue to manage expenses in a very refined way are all very important drivers of operating income to us and the issue for us is to make sure that our field sales organization, the management team has remained disciplined and focused on making sure our customers see the value that we are delivering and that we compete on that value rather than competing on price. And if we were able to do that we will be able to protect the margin that we're earning and not see it erode in some unfortunate way. So that's really the way we think about the business. Manage the manufacturer relationships of the branded side, manage the channel both the customer relationships side as well as the generic manufacturer relationships side in generics, control expenses, deliver great service, to make sure your customers understand that service so that when you are in a competitive situation they provide value points in their mind to what we deliver everyday.
Ricky Goldwasser – UBS: But again in fiscal '09, what for example, generic introductions had a great contribution than it did in fiscal '08?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, clearly generics are important to us this year, especially later in the year...
Ricky Goldwasser – UBS: Are there any specific product [inaudible] later in the year?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: There are whole series of products that are over the next couple of years expected to launch and we have estimates as to when we think they will and we know our estimates are wrong. Some will happen faster than we expect and some will happen later than we expect. But in aggregate, we usually do a pretty good job of managing our generic projections and our forecast in that business. So we really don't get much more specific than that, Ricky.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: Okay. One last try. The Pfizer price increase from last week, was this something that you're expecting and is it incremental to the guidance you gave us today? And do you think that we might see more of these type of increases coming through before year-end?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Surely one part of that question that I'll answer is and that is that is built into the guidance that we gave you today. We clearly... everything we talked about today is based on what we know as of today. As to whether it's incremental or whether it was expected etcetera those are all questions that are probably impossible to answer unless you have somebody at Pfizer they going to tell you what they are going to tell you what they are going to do with their price increases for the rest of the year etcetera. So, I think, as I said, we have some estimates as to where we think this is going to fall out. We try to give some guidance early on about our expectations around branded price increases, buffering a little bit our '08 so that people had a perspective as what was built into our guidance and hopefully that has been of some help.
Ricky Goldwasser – UBS: Okay, thank you.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: You are welcome.
Operator: Robert Willoughby, your line is open. State your company please.
Robert Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: Bank of America Securities. John or Jeff can you speak to any remaining opportunities with OTN here? Have you captured the synergies you'd hoped to realize there or is there still work left to do there? And similarly some for McQueary what's the magnitude of cost and/or capital savings on that deal?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, those are both good questions. I think the best way to describe the OTN situation is on our plans, on the case that we've established and developed for and we feel comfortable with. The team is doing a great job of executing against that gauge. So we're very optimistic. On the McQueary transaction, that transaction hasn't even closed yet. So probably it's premature for us to make any comments about that. Jeff?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: I'd just remind you Bob that the OTN business case which we've talked about in the past had $0.05 or $0.06 solution in fiscal '08 and another $0.05 or $0.06 in '09, that becomes accretive in FY '10. As you can imagine that's part of what drives us therefore to having a stronger back half in the '09 because we complete the integration as we go through the year.
Robert Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: That's great. Thank you.
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Eric Coldwell, your line is open, please state your company name.
Eric Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co.: Thank you. It's Robert W. Baird. And most of my strategic questions have been asked and answered, so I’ll ask a few technical ones. First up, Jeff, I think that in your past SEC documents, there was a reference to some FIN 48 accounting true-ups that might occur in fiscal '09. Can you give us an update on that and it does not appear as though there is any of that in your tax guidance or your continuing ops guidance for fiscal '09? What do you expect to see coming through there, if anything, please?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Well, you are correct that the guidance we've provided assumes a tax rate of 33%. As I mentioned when talking about the volatility of our tax rate, you always have, in many quarters, various settlements and other discrete items true-ups to tax returns, et cetera. You are correct in some of our SEC filings now under FIN 48. As with all companies, there is some disclosures around things that might happen in the future, but we certainly don't include those kinds of highly speculative things in our guidance.
Eric Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co.: If you were to achieve a benefit in fiscal '09 from the true up or the conclusion of FIN 48 audits, would that be excluded from your continuing ops guidance and treated as a one-off event?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Well, certainly if there was something of an extraordinary nature, yes.
Eric Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co.: Okay. Final question, congrats on getting the DEA controlled substances issue cleared up. Can you just quantify for us the impact in the quarter, if there was any kind of a drag in your P&L in the quarter related that? I missed it if it was in the press release.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: No. We didn't... we really didn't have any... other than the provision we took the last quarter for the settlement, that really is the economic drag on the business, and you might also have noticed in the settlement release we made yesterday, there is a couple of distribution centers and a couple of drugs we are going to have to shift them from neighboring DCs, but that's already been operationalized and our customers will see no interruption in service from that perspective. So, we're pleased to have the DEA issue behind us, and our teams are focused on making sure that on a go-forward basis, we continue to do a great job.
Eric Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co.: And in the guidance with the commentary on the June and September quarters, are there any incremental expenses from those? I don't know if you want to call them redundant shipments, or the shipments from the other DCs, are any of those expenses in the guidance for the first half of the year that would also lead to better performance in the second half?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. The guidance is guidance, but we don't anticipate this stuff is inconsequential. It won't make any difference at all.
Eric Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co.: Great. Let me add my congrats on a wonderful quarter. Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Bret Jones, your line is open. State your company name please.
Bret Jones - Leerink Swann: Hi, Leerink Swann. Good afternoon. I had a couple of questions, hoping to circle back on the HIT business, and maybe I am reading too much into your earlier answer, John. But it sounded to me like there might be a mix shift, a noticeable mix shift between clinical systems and revenue cycle management, and I was wondering if you could speak to that a little bit as far as what the growth is in clinical systems that you're showing?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: We're still... we still have a robust clinical systems business and probably led by our medical imaging business, which just has gotten phenomenal attraction and we continue to me great progress. We're now I think replacing those early generation PACS system with McKesson's more contemporary PACS system and probably saw an announcement on Canada where we're going to do some additional work up there with that business. So, I think we're really excited that we're making progress across the board, but the point that I made on revenue cycle is that many people probably define us more as a hospital healthcare clinical IT company, whereas I would like to think about us as a healthcare IT company that touches all parts of it, not just the clinical side, and revenue cycle is a spot where our customers have a particular interest. Once they have kind of accomplished their hospital clinical mission, they are focused on how can they improve their financial workflow. And in an environment where consumer is going to increasingly have responsibility for payment in the healthcare system having robust revenue cycle systems at both the physician level as well as the hospital level will be extremely important.
Bret Jones - Leerink Swann: Okay. If I could just follow up on that real quick, as far as the core clinical systems, are you still seeming growth in that segment of the business, excluding the medical imaging component?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Oh, yes. Sure, yes, we are.
Bret Jones - Leerink Swann: I just wanted to make sure. And then finally, I’d just like to ask about... I was just curious about how you feel about the disease management programs that you have in place and the work that is being done there and the business intelligence analytics that you are developing, do you think that they would benefit from a core claims processing system targeted towards players?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we had a business like that at one point and we understand it very well, and when we integrate with other providers of those core claims processing systems and clearly we work with our customers on that front. We really have a very integrated approach whether we own all of the software underlying these approaches or not. On the DM side of the business, we are pleased with the progress we have made and I think that our teams continue to prove as I talked about in my prepared comments with these large Medicaid contracts at the state levels that we've the ability to deliver real savings, economic savings for our Medicaid customers. But as important, if you were talk to the patients enrolled in these programs, there's a tremendous boost and satisfaction at the state level, and that's why these governors are bragging about how well these programs are doing for their constituents. So, we are optimistic about the DM business and continue to pursue opportunities in these areas.
Bret Jones - Leerink Swann: All right. Great. Thank you.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Ransom. Please state your company name, please.
John Ransom - Raymond James: Hi, Raymond James. Just to clarify for fiscal '09, is OTN going to be mutual accretive or slight drag or kind of immaterial at this point?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: OTN was $0.05 to $0.06 diluted in '08. We expect that same level of dilution in '09, and accretive beginning in '10. So, as you can imagine, that means by the back half of fiscal '09, it will be helping us.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: So maybe some of the confusion, John, was my comment about it being on its business case. So, we had originally said it was going to be dilutive, and what I was referring to is, we're on our... on the plan that we'd originally established and we're pleased with our progress.
John Ransom - Raymond James: And can you just remind me what leads to that earnings progression as adjusted to a synergy capture or is there something else going on in that business that causes that kind of earnings progression?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: No, it’s just synergy capture primarily.
John Ransom - Raymond James: Okay. And I don't [inaudible] but some terrific results, especially relative to your peers this morning. Thanks.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Charles Boorady, may you go ahead and announce your company name please?
Charles Boorady - Citigroup: Thanks, with Citi. The first question on the OTN accretion, I just wanted to be clear, that was on a GAAP basis after amortization expense, so on a cash-basis it would be less dilutive than that?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Absolutely. In fact that's all in, including one-time integration cost and everything.
Charles Boorady – Citigroup: And if you excluded amortization in those integration costs, roughly what would it be adding on a cash EPS basis? If you could remind us what the amortization expense is expected to be annually?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: I must confess, Charles, I don't have that number off the top of my head. Obviously, it will be much... particularly since we've got the integration cost in there in '09, if you take out those and the amortization, you'd have a very positive looking number.
Charles Boorady – Citigroup: All right. And then just a question on the guidance, you said that it assumes that market growth for distribution solutions which I assume will look at IMS projections unless you have better ones to guide us forward, but on the Technology Solutions, you mentioned high-end of market revenue growth, what do you see as the range in the high-end for the market revenue growth in Tech Solutions?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Those numbers move around a little bit as well, and we're... when we are talking about this, we usually see a range of 6% to 8% kind of ranges for Tech Solutions, and so we will be at the high-end of that range, that's what really what we're referring to.
Charles Boorady – Citigroup: Got it. And that's organic, or is that with the addition of acquisitions?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: That's primarily organic. In our conversation today that... we're not talking about anything other than organic growth for both those businesses.
Charles Boorady – Citigroup: Great. And just last question if you can, and it’s a big picture one, just your general outlook for independent pharmacies, and any data points you can give us on your Health Mart franchise? Yes, specifically and later than McQueary acquisition, are you seeing less risk from AMP to independents or anything emerging on the independent front that makes that an attractive business to be investing in right now?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, the independent business has always been an attractive business for us. And 175 years ago, we started really in the independent pharmacy business, now they might have been wagons back then, but it is a big part of our view of… an important aspect of the way healthcare is delivered in this country, and we are... are seeing at least that our independent customers have pretty solid base of business and growing slightly less obviously than the market because they don't have the same momentum perhaps as other players. But they are growing, and our store comps are growing in our important programs like Health Mart, and I mentioned that that's almost 2,000 stores now. So, I think we believe strongly that the independent segment is here to stay and that it is a worthy and an important segment and it is one that we need to be in and need to support and we saw great benefit from our D&K wholesale...which is… purchase, which is not that different than the McQueary Brothers. There is obviously a scale difference, but we are optimistic and feel strongly that this would be successful also, and as important that our customers will be more successful because they do business with McKesson. I think we’ve run out of time for questions today. I want to thank everybody for participating, and thank you operator for helping us on the call. We had excellent results last year. We are very excited about our unique offerings and our positions in healthcare and we think we can turn that value on an ongoing basis like we have in the past into value for our customers and value for our shareholders. Now we will complement Ana on her inaugural press release as the new Head of Investor Relations for us and I hand the call off to her to talk about our upcoming events. Ana?

Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to McKesson Corporation Fiscal 2008 Third Quarter Conference Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Mr. Larry Kurtz, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Larry Kurtz - Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you, Angie. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson fiscal 2008 third quarter conference call for the financial community. With me today are John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO; and Jeff Campbell, our CFO. John will provide a business update and will then introduce Jeff, who will review the financial results for the quarter. After Jeff's comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour, at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Thanks, and here's John.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Larry, and thanks, everyone for joining us on our call today. McKesson continued to have positive market momentum in our third quarter with revenues up 15%. Distribution Solutions revenues grew 14%, driven primarily by solid growth in new business from existing customers and the acquisition of Oncology Therapeutics Network, or OTN. Technology Solutions revenues increased 35%, driven by the acquisition of Per-Se Technologies, and continued expansion in software and services. Operating performance is also strong, given that we faced a difficult comparison versus the third quarter a year ago, due primarily to the timing of generic drug launches last year versus this year. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $0.68 this year versus $0.79 a year ago. However, we took several actions in the quarter designed to improve future results, which reduced our third quarter EPS by $0.13, including $0.02 of dilution resulting from our acquisition of OTN. As you are probably aware, diversion of controlled substances has been an industry issue. Nothing is more important to our industry than the safety and integrity of the drug supply chain. McKesson has had strong productive relationships with regulatory authorities, focused on achieving this goal. We are in discussions with the Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S Attorney Offices to resolve claims around certain customer orders for selected controlled substances. We have been implementing improvements to our comprehensive controls and reporting procedures to avoid future claims of this type. And we've recorded a legal reserve of $13 million during the quarter within our Distribution Solutions segment and believe this reserve is adequate for the claims. The reserve is not tax deductible. This charge and the expenses for the improvements we are making to our procedures and controls are absorbed in our annual guidance. Turning back to our outlook. Both our segments are achieving steady, balanced revenue growth. People continue to take drugs because of the health benefits they provide. When possible, they substitute generic drugs, which has a positive effect on our profitability. We are seeing a continued emphasis on the use of information technologies to reduce healthcare costs and improve health outcomes. We continue to be upbeat about our revenue growth across our business during the time when there are broader concerns about the growth of the economy overall. Based on our results to date and a strong performance in the fourth quarter, we expect that McKesson should earn between $3.22 and $3.32 per diluted share for fiscal 2008. Before I turn the call over to Jeff for a detailed review of our financial results, I will highlight the positive trends in our business and some of the specific progress we are making to deliver sustained growth and performance. Our strong Distribution Solutions revenue growth in the quarter reflects growing demand and expanding relationships among the most diverse and balanced customer base in the industry. We serve some of the largest and fastest growing pharmacy operators in both United States and Canada, including leading retail chains, mail-order pharmacies, mass merchandisers and food drug combos. These customers value the efficiencies and working capital savings our business model provides and have been rewarding us with new business that drives additional revenue growth. For hospital customers, we have a broad value proposition that addresses their key issues of safety and quality of care, which is driving revenue growth and creating stronger relationships. During the quarter, McKesson signed three hospital systems to one McKesson agreement that represent expansions of existing relationships or new multi-business contracts. For independent pharmacies, our key value-creating offering is our Health Mart franchise, which provides a menu of products and services designed to help our customers compete more effectively and profitably. McKesson now has about 1,800 Health Mart franchise stores, an increase of more than 400 during the first three quarters, as more and more independent pharmacies are now recognizing the value of Health Mart's end-to-end products and services. Health Mart pharmacies participate in our proprietary OneStop Generics program which delivers great value to our customers. There is an exceptional pipeline of higher margin generic product opportunities that are forecast for launch over the next several years. And we've grown our base of customers that rely on McKesson for access to these important drugs at competitive prices. The number of pharmacies in our proprietary OneStop program has been increasing, reflecting more participation across a wide range of customers, with particular progress among independents, regional chains, and hospital group purchasing organizations. Even more importantly, we've been expanding our programs focused on the rapid launch of products into the channel called ASAP and ASAP Plus which ensure that participating pharmacies will have adequate supplies to meet initial patient demands in the first days or months of our new generic product launch. Over the past year based on our track record for rapid customer penetration and shipment execution for generic drugs as they enter the market, the number of participating pharmacies in our ASAP program has grown 14% and the number in ASAP Plus has grown 40%. Our expanding base for generics and our ability to execute on generic product launches enhances our opportunities for stronger relationships with generic manufacturers. During the third quarter, McKesson was selected by Teva Pharmaceuticals as a strategy to launch partner for the generic version of Protonix, one of the leading treatments for erosive acid reflux disease. Teva launched generic Protonix after the close of business on December 21, and McKesson customers received their shipments the next business morning. In summary, generics continue to be a great opportunity at McKesson. This year we had a significant profit hole to fill from three major generic drugs, two of which had lower profit margins in the third quarter this year and one of which is no longer on the market. Overall the growth in our customer base and our great relationships with manufacturers enabled our generics team to fill that profit hole, an outstanding performance. Finally, our acquisition of OTN provides our participation in the rapidly growing market for specialty pharmaceuticals. Sales of specialty drugs are increasing faster than the market. It's a terrific opportunity for us, and we have begun executing on our plan to combine OTN with our existing specialty business to improve efficiencies and enhance our offering. Looking ahead, McKesson is strategically well positioned to deliver continued solid results in Distribution Solutions. The demographics of an aging population are driving increased use of pharmaceuticals across North America, and there is a great pipeline of significant generic product introductions on the horizon. We have a diverse customer base. We offer a broader value proposition. And we are expanding our base of generics customers, and we've enhanced our position in the fastest growing sector of the market, specialty distribution. We have a great business at a great time. Turning to Technology Solutions. We have tremendous opportunity for continued value creation. We have the most comprehensive set of software, services and automation systems for hospitals, physician offices, home healthcare, and payers. And we are winning in the market as shown by the recent decisions by Community Health Systems, Aetna and Cigna to expand their relationships. The continued expansion of our core hospital and physician business combined with our acquisition of Per-Se Technologies and the transition of our growing payor business into this unit has created the world's largest healthcare information technology company with sales that will approach $3 billion this fiscal year. Interest remains high in our clinical and imaging solutions, our payor software in disease management programs and our RelayHealth offering, inside and outside our customer base. We had an especially strong quarter for new sales of medical imaging, cardiology imaging, analytic solutions and automation systems, an indication that there is continuing market demand in these sectors. We continue to receive high marks from customers for product quality, implementation, and support. The 2007 year-end Top 20 best-in-class awards report has been released and seven of McKesson's products are either rated best-in-class or a solution category leader. Overall, 18 McKesson solutions are ranked in the top three for their categories in this report, the most of any company. Our integration of Per-Se continues to be ahead of schedule and provides McKesson with important new capabilities to meet growing needs for better connectivity and funds flow in the evolving healthcare environment. Our goal over the long-term is to use our unique software and service technologies, broad offering and large installed-base of customers to deliver above market growth with more predictability and less risk. Last year's acquisition of Per-Se and the transition of the payor business into the segment gave us the chance to reevaluate our combined product offering and organization. It is our strategy to continue to build and expand our offering, even when we have market momentum to ensure that we stay ahead of our customers needs. As a result of the new organization, during the quarter, we took several actions to streamline our staffing and product lines to improve efficiencies and deliver better customer solutions in the coming years. The charges associated with these actions reduced this quarter's MTS operating profit by $25 million. For the full year, including the P&L impact of these actions in the quarter, we expect to make significant progress toward our goal of low to mid-teens operating margin for the segment, solidly reaching double-digits. It's great that we can absorb those levels of charges and still meet or exceed our financial goals for the year. We take a similar approach with our corporate staff and organization to constantly rebuild and streamline our operations, taking advantage of our scale. Over the next nine to 18 months, we will transition 79 corporate information technology positions from Dubuque Iowa to other McKesson data centers in Atlanta and Rancho Cordova, California. Some media have misinterpreted this action as involving our Technology Solutions' operation in Dubuque, it did not. We employed 340 people there in our practice management and EDI operations, serving approximately 20% of the physicians in the country along with a significant number of hospitals, and additional payors. Over the next 12 months, they will be moving to a new modern facility in Dubuque, but they were not affected at all by our corporate IT transition. Here are some individual accomplishments that underscore the outstanding set of assets we have in Technology Solutions and how we are executing to drive value creation. During the quarter we expanded our relationship with Community Health Systems or CHS, the nation's leading publicly-owned operator of general acute care hospitals. We signed an agreement, whereby CHS will deploy McKesson's physician portal, electronic medical records and performance analytics tools across most facilities. The new agreement is larger in scope and size than our original agreement with Triad Hospitals, which reflects the strength of our Horizon Clinicals offering and the strategic relationship between McKesson and CHS. Earlier I mentioned three-one McKesson agreements signed this quarter. At both Baxter’s Health [ph] and ProMedica, we won new business because we can offer comprehensive integrated solutions from doc-side to bedside. In both cases, the customer chose One McKesson over a combination of two or three vendors. We see this trend towards single vendor solutions increasing, as our customers prefer to have a single point of contact and accountability for executing our complex implementations with ambitious clinical and business objectives. We see the same trend among payor customers. During the quarter, CIGNA HealthCare and Etna began expanding Internet access to physicians for their members, through services provided by McKesson's RelayHealth business. CIGNA and Etna are each pharmaceutical distribution customers for their mail order pharmacies and customers of our market leading software for payors. CIGNA is going nationwide with our web visit service, following the successful four-state pilot program. Web visit is a reimbursable online physician consultation service. At Etna, members and physicians in more than 30 medical specialty categories will now have nationwide access to web visit, following the successful three-state pilot. In addition, we had a successful implementation of our claims performance solution; claims extend under a five-year agreement with Etna, which was signed in August of 2007. During the quarter, we also signed an agreement with a large Midwest Health System and one of our strategic banking partners for a pilot project in healthcare banking. This project is designed to test and refine payment solutions for the complex issues and gaps that currently exist between the many parties involved and the healthcare settlement process, from coverage eligibility determination to final settlement. I'm excited about our Technology Solutions business and believe it will be a source of significant shareholder value creation in the coming years. Our core software and automation businesses continue to grow, helped by opportunities created by our One McKesson comprehensive offering. The size and scope of our organization will continue to enable us to streamline our common functions and align product development for innovation and economies of scale. We have increasing balance and predictability in our revenue stream. We are the market leader in emerging areas of healthcare information, financial connectivity and disease management. In summary, we have great momentum across McKesson through the first three quarters of fiscal 2008. Both Distributions Solutions and Technology Solutions have deep loyal customer bases, solid revenue growth, and opportunities for margin expansion. Our strong balance sheet and operating cash flow provide resources to further the creation of additional shareholder value. I look forward to reporting to you on our results for the fourth quarter, but with that, let me turn the call over to Jeff and I'll return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Well, thank you, John, and good afternoon everyone. As you just heard, McKesson had a solid quarter in line with our expectations for our ongoing business, despite facing difficult comparisons versus the third quarter a year ago and some charges we took in this quarter. This creates some complexity in the quarter, which I'll sort out as we walk through our financial results. Overall, one month into the fourth fiscal quarter, we continue to expect a strong finish to the year. Let me first begin by reviewing the consolidated income statement. We had revenue growth in the quarter of 15% to $26.5 billion, Distribution Solutions revenues, which given their size are always the primary driver for overall revenue growth, grew 14%, benefiting from increased sales to existing customers in our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution business into a lesser extent by the acquisition of OTN which we closed on October 29, 2007. Technology Solutions revenues grew 35%, continuing to benefit from the acquisition of Per-Se Technology, which closed a year ago, this week. On the 15% revenue growth, overall gross profit for the quarter was up 13% to $1.2 billion. We saw some decline in the gross margin in both segments, which I'll discuss in a few minutes, partially offset by the growing contribution of the higher-margin Technology Solutions segment due to the Per-Se acquisition. Moving below the gross profit line, our total operating expenses were up 24% to $922 million for the quarter. Operating expenses in the quarter were negatively impacted by $38 million in pre-tax charges, $13 million of which were non-tax deductible. As John mentioned, these charges primarily stem from actions taken to improve our future results. In addition, our operating expenses grew due to our acquisitions of Per-Se, OTN, and several smaller companies, normal growth to support our revenue growth, an incremental FAS 123 charges for the company of $11 million. Turning back and I walk down the P&L. Operating income of $282 million in the quarter was 11% below last year. However, excluding this quarter's charges of $41 million, $3 million of which hit gross profit. Operating income would have been 1.6% above last year. This performance keeps us in line with our expectations for the full year. In the prior year December quarter we had significant earnings from the launches of Generic Zocor and Zoloft, and the short-lived launch of generic Plavix. In addition, as said on last quarter's call, our strong September quarter results this year were helped by a shift of some of our expected profit from the December quarter back into the September quarter. For the year, we remain on track with our expectations, including our expectations for the year for both branded price increases and generics. Moving below operating income, our interest expense of $36 million was $13 million greater than the prior year, due to the $1 billion in additional debt, which we used to finance a portion of our Per-Se acquisition. Our capital deployment [inaudible] is more broadly give us lower cash balances this year. This resulted in lower interest income, which was the primary driver of other income of $31 million, being $8 million lower than the prior year. Our reported tax rate was approximately 28% both this year and in last year's December quarter. This year's effective tax rate remains unchanged at 33%. The lower reported rate of this quarter reflects $20 million of discrete tax benefits primarily related to the completion of our IRS audit for the years 2000 to 2002, offset in part by the $13 million non-deductible pre-tax charge. You will recall that last year's reported rate of 28% was due to some tax return true-ups and the cumulative effect of reducing our effective rate at the time from 35% to 34%. On a GAAP basis, this quarter, we had net income from continuing operations of $201 million or $0.68 per diluted share, compared to $243 million or $0.79 per diluted share a year ago, excluding the $41 million of pre-tax charges or $0.11 per diluted share McKesson's income from continuing operations would have been essentially flat year-over-year. Let me once again remind you that our earnings this quarter also include $0.02 of dilution from the acquisition of OTN and related integration costs. To wrap up, our consolidated results in the quarter, our diluted EPS calculation was based on 297 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding compared to 302 million in the prior year. The number of shares used in this calculation declined due to the cumulative impact of our share repurchases including $230 million of stock repurchase in the third quarter which brings our total share repurchase for the fiscal year to $914 million. Let's now move on to our two operating segments. In Distribution Solutions for the quarter, we achieved revenue growth of 14%, driven primarily by the 17% growth in our US pharmaceutical direct distribution and services revenues. And I mentioned earlier, these revenues benefited from increased sales to existing customers, the OTN acquisition, and one extra day of sales in the quarter. So excluding the OTN revenues and the one extra day of sales, our US pharmaceutical direct distribution and services revenues grew at about 11%. Canadian revenues increased 32% for the quarter including a large favorable currency impact of 18%, reflecting new and expanded distribution agreements and one extra day of sales in the quarter. Let me digress just for a minute here to clear up any confusion about the impact of the Canadian dollar exchange rate on our consolidated financial results. It is true that the strong Canadian dollar helps the US dollar earnings of our Canadian distribution business. However, we also have a large IT workforce in Canada, which is part of our MTS segment and the expense of this workforce creates a large offset or essentially a natural hedge against the profits of our Canadian distribution business. So our consolidated EPS results are not materially impacted by changes in the Canadian dollar exchange rate. Going back to the revenue lines now, Medical-Surgical Distribution revenues were up 3% for the quarter. We shipped flu vaccine earlier this year, which is reflected in our strong 11% growth, in the September quarter. Normalizing, we see ourselves growing at about markets rates for the year-to-date. For Distribution Solutions overall, gross profit was up 9% to $859 million for quarter. So while we lost a bit of gross margin this quarter versus the prior-year. We'd expect the full year to be fairly flat. While we grew our gross profit dollars from generics, our margin this quarter was down impacted by the tough year ago generic comps. In addition, as discussed on our last quarterly call a larger proportion of our branded manufacturer compensation was earned in our second quarter this year. In this quarter, we had a LIFO credit of $10 million versus a LIFO credit of $18 million in the prior year. Our Distribution Solutions operating expenses were up 20% for the quarter to $554 million. Third quarter operating expenses this year included charges totaling $16 million, 13 of which as we've discussed provides for a pending legal settlement, and $3 million of which was for restructuring charges. Operating profit of $312 million was down 8% from the prior year, excluding the $16 million in charges in this segment, the operating profit of our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution business was fairly flat year-over-year. We also had stronger operating performance year-over-year in Canada in Medical-Surgical, offset by continued investments in our retail automation and specialty businesses, including the OTN acquisition. For the entire year, we now expect that our GAAP operating margin in Distribution Solutions will dip a few basis points below our long-term target range of 150 to 200 basis points, as we absorb our continued investments in specialty distribution and OTN. Our margins in our core U.S. pharmaceutical business will be flat to down a few basis points for the whole year, considering this quarter's charges and the sharp decline year-over-year in our LIFO credit. Looking forward, while we will not be providing FY '09 guidance until our next earnings release, we have a clear goal and expectation that we will gain leverage in this segment in FY '09 and be back within our target range. In Technology Solutions, our revenues were up 35% for the quarter to $736 million. Revenue growth is being driven by the acquisition of Per Se and continued growth in software and services. Service revenues, which now account for 75% of revenue in this segment, were up 48% to $553 million in the quarter. Software and software systems revenues were up 14% to $150 million. Revenues from 74% of this quarter's bookings were deferred into future periods similar to the 76% deferred in the prior year third quarter. Gross profit increased 27% in this segment, providing a gross margin of 46.9%. Our acquisition of Per Se and our evolving mix of business has lowered this margin a bit, so these businesses should be additive to our operating margin over time. Driven by charges in the acquisition of Per Se, Technology Solutions expenses increased 43% in the quarter to $300 million. In the quarter, we had $22 million of charges composed of $18 million to streamline staffing and product lines, $4 million for legal settlements. Excluding these charges, operating expenses would have grown 32%, providing some leverage on our 35% revenue growth, despite incremental FAS 123R expenses of $7 million from the prior year and continued investments in new product development. To size this investment for the quarter, Technology Solutions had total gross R&D spending of $105 million, an increase of 25% from the prior year. Of this amount, we capitalized just 16% compared to 21% a year ago. Operating profit of $49 million was 22% below last year. However, excluding charges of $25 million in the quarter, but including $7 million in incremental FAS 123 expenses. Operating profit of $74 million would have been up 17% from a year ago. We continue to believe we are on target to reach our previous expectations of low double-digit operating margins on an annual basis this year, even including the $25 million in charges. Now turning briefly to the balance sheet. On the working capital side, our receivables increased 16% primarily due to our sales increase to $7.5 billion versus $6.4 billion a year ago. Our day sales outstanding were flat to 22 days. Our inventories were $9.6 billion on December 31, an 11% increase over the last year. Our day sales in inventory of 34, was one day below last year. Compared to a year ago, payables were up 14% to $12.4 billion, our day sales in payables were unchanged at 44 days. So year-to-date, we've generated $915 million in operating cash flow. While we used cash this quarter due to our typical seasonal buildup in working capital we are expecting strong cash flow in our fiscal fourth quarter. We now expect to generate more than $1.5 billion in cash flow from operations for the full fiscal year. Before I leave our cash flow, let me clarify one item from this quarter's cash flow statement, if you look at it closely. As you recall, we paid $962 million back in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 to settle our consolidated securities litigation action. We have since shown this $962 million as restricted cash on our balance sheet pending the final resolution of all possible objections to the settlement. The good news is that we have now reached this point so the $962 million in restricted cash and the associated liability have been removed from our balance sheet this quarter. But somewhat confusing way, this is reflected in the cash flow statement is as both a use of operating cash and a source of investing cash. I would just focus on the fact that the net impact on our cash flows for the quarter and the year is zero. Turning now to capital spending, year-to-date we've spent $129 million higher than the $76 million a year ago, primarily due to some DC renovations and continued investments in our information systems. Capitalized software expenditures were $118 million similar to the $119 million we spent a year ago. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion of cash consistent with our portfolio strategy for capital deployment. Year-to-date we've repurchased $914 million of shares, paid $53 million in dividends, invested $247 million internally and made $592 million of acquisitions. We still have approximately $1.1 billion of share repurchases authorization left. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 23% at December 31. So overall we've had three solid quarters and now expect that McKesson should earn between $3.22 and $3.32 per diluted share for fiscal 2008 excluding any adjustments to the securities litigation reserves. Now let me be explicit here and say that this guidance includes the $0.11 in charges we took this quarter. Said another way, for the first three quarters, McKesson had earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.27 excluding any adjustments to the securities litigation reserves. Relative to where we were last quarter, we're absorbing $0.11 in charges in our full-year guidance. As we discussed last quarter, we are also absorbing $0.05 to $0.06 of dilution from OTN for the year, which includes some one-time integration costs. So our view of the recurring operating results of our businesses remain strong. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Question and Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Randall Stanicky. Please state your company name and you may ask your question.
Randall Stanicky - Goldman Sachs: Great. Randall Stanicky, Goldman Sachs. John and Jeff, just you referred to Protonix being exclusive for the strategic provider in your press release. I guess, just two questions there. Will that extent to an additional launch or they are just on the initial launch from Teva? And then secondly, how do you view your current supply of your generic to provide customers at the current time? And then just a follow-up kind of more big picture question for John. Do you consider or see an opportunity going forward, a lot of conjecture in the marketplace for some average launch opportunities particularly as we look at fiscal year '08? Do you envision an opportunity or do you see an opportunity for the drug wholesalers to get more aggressive in partnering with the generic companies here that bring generics to market, in other words, perhaps indemnifying some of the risks, John, damages going forward?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks for the question. I'll see if I can answer them and I'll ask Jeff to jump in here if I miss anything. On Protonix, clearly we had a very good relationship with Teva that allowed us to be in a good position for that launch. I don't think we've described it as an exclusive relationship for the launch. So let me just be clear there. I just think we had product for our customers very early, basically the data was available, it was in our customer shelves and we feel our customers benefited by our quick action there and access to the product. Relative to the supply of generics, we clearly try to purchase supply that matches demand in the event that we believe that demand is going to outstrip our supply, obviously, we try to get more than our fair share of the product that might be available once again benefiting our customers and benefiting our company. And on your third question, as it relates to at-risk launches, we clearly have an awareness about the fact that these can be value creating opportunities for the generic companies, if it's successful, as well as the wholesalers that are part of the distribution channel. McKesson, at least as far as I'm concerned, will never be involved in taking on the risk associated with those decisions. I don't think we're well positioned to do that, we don't have the knowledge base nor the resources too to put ourselves in that position. That doesn't mean we want to avail ourselves of the opportunity and we won’t try to bring our tremendous customer base to the table with the generic companies, so they get access to those customers in a quick efficient way and they get an immediate update for the product. So we're not planning on taking financial risk associated with that risk launches. And I don't know whether you talked about or not, but from a planning perspective we really don't look at at-risk launches as a component part of our publicly communicated expectations, and frankly even our internal planning. We know that these things can come and go and it's very difficult to predict them, and then I think that to the extent they happen, their upsides and opportunities for us into the extent they don't… we certainly don't want our head baked into our financial projections, something that is so far out of our ability to project, so Randall, I don't know if that answers your questions, but --.
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: I might just have one other clarification on Protonix, which is… because it was such a late launch in our quarter the financial impact of it for us is really the March quarter issue and had no material impact in the December.
Randall Stanicky - Goldman Sachs: Thanks.
Operator: Robert Willoughby. Please state your company name and you may ask your question.
Robert Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: I think that's me, Banc of America. Can you hear me?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Yes, yes.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Robert.
Robert Willoughby - Banc of America Securities: Unbelievably dam question. Is it your understanding that most folks will call out that $0.11 of non-operating kind of charge and push that fourth quarter estimate higher to get to the range that you put out there?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Well, you know that our philosophy is we try to be very clear about the drivers both on a recurring basis and on a non-recurring basis in our results. But we also really try to let you and our other investors make their own decisions about what's… how they want to view their results. Just to be clear, certainly we look at the $0.11 and view it as non-recurring, we also view it primarily, not exclusively, when you look at the legal issues, as things that we very consciously chose to do to better position our cost structure on our product lines for the future. So that's why we have in essence kept our guidance the same, while absorbing the $0.11 of charges, and for that matter also $0.05 or $0.06 of dilution from OTN, because we think it's clear for us to just provide the guidance on a GAAP basis.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: That's above… just to reinforce what Jeff was saying. We only try to provide you GAAP numbers and then give you the make-up of those numbers. And I think the second thing is that we have had some successful sometime in our company and one of the things that we're absolutely focused on is never becoming complacent in our operations and taking for granted our continued performances. So we've encouraged our people to think about organization and structure and product lines in a very aggressive way to position the company for continued strong performance. And as we talked about in our previous comments, the creation of MTS created opportunities for us to leverage our scale and our assets and take additional cost out and streamline our products offering. So, we look at these things actually in a very productive way, the cost that we can get out now and aggressively position ourselves for the future and we encourage our teams to do it.
Operator: Lisa Gill. Please state your company name and you may ask your question.
Lisa Gill - J.P. Morgan: Lisa Gill with J.P. Morgan. Good afternoon. Just in very simple terms, does that mean that the next quarter that we are looking at is… basically the range is $0.95 to $1.05?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Lisa Gill - J.P. Morgan: Okay. [inaudible]. Good. And then just secondly, John, can you maybe just talk about your revenue growth rates? I mean, clearly it is growing faster than the industry for quite some time now. You obviously have some big customers, but for your direct business to grow at 11%, can you talk about what some of the drivers are there? Are you taking business from your competitors? Is that expanded offering within your customer base? And then, as it relates to that and we think about distribution margins, I know there is charges and there is OTN, but as we think about the operating profit, are you sacrificing any margins to get additional revenue dollars?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks for the questions, Lisa. I… we're really pleased with the progress we're making with our value proposition for our customers. And I think that our entire focus has been how do we deliver more value for our customers and in return get more value for us. So that it's not a price oriented discussion, but it's a value oriented discussion, and we're getting additional market share from existing customers from their spend, and I would tell you that, I'm not 100% aware of all of the revenue, but I would tell you that most of it is coming from revenue that they would have primarily purchased on a direct basis. So when we take out the generics volume from someone, most of that generics business was probably purchased direct, particularly at the mid-sized chains and some of the larger customers. But the smaller independent customers, they might be buying from Internet kinds of... fax marketing kinds of generic people, but largely the business we are enjoying is business that is incremental to us, and coming out of the source that would otherwise be direct. As to whether or not we'll be sacrificing price or margin to garner additional revenue growth, last I looked... it's very difficult to invest revenue or spend revenue. So we are very focused on growing earnings and expanding our margins. And so it's... if our incentive structures are working, people are growing earnings faster than they are growing revenues, they'd be very reluctant to give up price or margin to get revenue growth. And so what we are trying to do here is, always get positive drop in our businesses. So we are growing earnings faster than revenues and we're making great progress against that objective.
Lisa Gill - J.P. Morgan: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Glen Santangelo. Please state our company name and you may ask your question.
Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse-North America: Yes, John. I just had a quick question regarding the drug distribution margin this quarter versus where it was in September, you talked on last quarter's conference call about some of the mid-tier chains like [inaudible] as they use to buy direct, and all of a sudden, you're selling them generics and you kind of commented last quarter that that benefited your generic sales, which ultimately benefited your margin. Given that you are increasing your revenues, to these sort of mid-tier customers and increasing your generic compliance, could you just help me think about why the total op profit dollars were sort of declined from September to December?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, absolutely I think that Jeff mentioned in his comments, one of the things he talked about was... how pleased we were that our team was able to fill the void created by the year-over-year comparison, third quarter a year ago we had three big generic launches, two of the products have dropped in price from that year to this year, and one of the products is no longer available on the market on a generic basis. So as we guided at the beginning of the year, we told folks that our second and third quarters are going to be difficult compares largely driven by those comparisons. And we also have been entirely focused on how do we gain additional market share in our existing generic business, in our existing customers... exactly like you described Wegmans and rest of those folks picking up that generic business helped us hold our operating profit relatively flat in our generic business, or in our distribution business, if you take out the charges and a flat comparison with that huge prior-year, is terrifically result for us. So I... I think that... if you study the industry, you'll find that our ability to continue to drive generic volume through our existing customers, sets us apart and has allowed us to come through what was a very difficult compare, which I think terrific result.
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: The one other thing, Glen, that I mentioned in my remarks is, if you go back a quarter, you'll recall that I pointed out that some of our branded manufacturer compensation which we had in our plans for the year, to be in December or March quarter events, clearly got pulled back into that September quarter. So it both made that September quarter look particularly strong this year and made this look a little weaker. Frankly when we added all up for the year, we were pretty much tracking to our expectation.
Operator: Thank you. Tom Gallucci, please state your company name and you may ask your question.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Merrill Lynch. I just had two things. Just following-up on that one Jeff, just as to be clear that, sequentially the change in, let's say, operating profit dollars in the distribution segment, you are pointing to branded price inflation or brand... earnings driven by price increases as a key to that. Maybe was it $38 million or $40 million sequential difference?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Well, yes. It is the short answer.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Is there any other things that we should be thinking about or just sequentially?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Tom, we will talk for a while about the fact that we feel we have a real good read now our branded manufacturer compensation over each contractual year to the manufacturer. But it… we don't know it is getting right quarter-to-quarter.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Yes. Sure, that is understandable. But there is no other major variable sequentially that we should be thinking about, okay.
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Year-over-year comparison that on to generic side for the last December was pretty tough.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Sure, definitely. Well just one quick clarification, you said tax rate, 33%. You expected 33% for the fourth quarter or is it going to sort of average 33% for the year and then such that the fourth quarter is going to be higher than that sort of average out the low one in the third quarter?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: The rate… our effective rate is 33% and it should remain that way for the foreseeable future. It is… of course each quarter there are some true-ups. This quarter because we had a pretty sizable and very positive settle plan or settlement within the IRS on our 2000 to 2002 audits, you had some one-time good guys that brought the 33 down to the 28. But 33 is the ongoing rate. That is what you need to expect for Q4.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then [inaudible] LIFO, is there anything in this quarter that was material?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: We took a $10 million LIFO credit this quarter versus the $18 million last quarter.
Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Charles Boorady, please state your company name and you may ask your question.
Charles Boorady - Citigroup: Citigroup. What was the revenue impact of OTN in the quarter?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: The way I think about it is if you look at the US pharmaceutical direct distribution and services revenues, it was up 17% for the year. If you take OTN and the factory had one extra sales day this year out, you are in 11%. So I don't have them… you can do that math.
Charles Boorady - Citigroup: Yes, I can do that math, but that is great. And then the range of guidance… and thanks for doing the math on the fourth quarter. Some companies haven't been able to do that. But it is a pretty wide range, I am just wondering what things specifically could swing it to one side of the range versus the other, and is the midpoint of that range your best estimate?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Well in general the midpoint is... you should always assume it is going to be our best estimate. There is really two things that we don't have complete control over the timing of that material. One is, as we have talked about just a minute ago, the branded manufacturer price increases because our contract years are stagnate right. We don't have a March 31 contract years for all the manufacturers. So some of them, they could slip into the June quarter and we are still well within the contract. The second thing is of course we do have software businesses that sometimes recognize revenue in lumpy pieces and we have a couple of big lumps that could probably go either way and could drive the number by a couple of pennies.
Charles Boorady - Citigroup: Yes, got it. Okay, so it is not like this one $0.10 item that could come in the quarter or some following quarter... that makes sense. And then just finally on the last call you mentioned those, those four customers that are buying generics through you that were buying direct. And I'm wondering are you able to estimate or have they shared with you their estimate on the percent savings that they are able to achieve by making that switch?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I don't know that they would necessarily share that with us. I guess the best way to think about at those are… there have to be a savings for them to move the business to us and the savings might have come in many different ways. Clearly the cost of the product sale, for the price we are charging versus the price they will pay if they sourced direct is a component of the total value we are delivering. Another component of the total value would be the people they normally employ, they do that negotiation and sourcing on their own and the third level of value that we deliver is obviously the ability to bundle the product from a service and a delivery perspective and an ordering perspective with McKesson's overall larger orders. So they are purchasing brand from us and getting it everyday, they wake up 5:30 in the morning, now they can throw their generic demand in that same order and pick up the same thing and probably have improved fill rates a single PO to pay or purchase... a single pay order to... PO to deliver and a single payment to make against an invoice. And all those have costs and efficiency ramifications and all told the reason we're gaining share on direct spend of generics and moving it through McKesson is because the total value proposition is superior as the customer reflects on what they have to do, they do it on their own. And then I have to admit that things like Protonix may not be available to some of those customers on a direct basis as fast as it was available from McKesson. And that certainly has to feed into their decision-making. A few extra days or a week or a month's worth of supply of a product that they otherwise couldn't get access to makes a big difference when they think about us as a partner.
Charles Boorady - Citigroup: That makes a lot of sense. Given that... and you mentioned some reasonable size chains. Is there a certain size above which you don't have a compelling pitch to a customer to hand that generic purchasing to you as opposed to doing it in-house, for example is somebody as big as Rite Aid, are they someone that you feel like give a chance to up sell to start doing the generics on their behalf, were they so big that you couldn't match what they could do on their own?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Being sort of a salesmen it is hard, I would tell you that there is no customer too big to hopefully be convinced by us that we are a better alternative. To be practical about it, clearly the bigger buyers of generics probably get close to our sourcing prices and then when you try to put our margin on top of that, we maybe a little bit difficult. We have to get a complete value prop consideration to offset the margin requirement that McKesson has frankly to handle the product. So there are some customers of certain sizes that are more difficult for us to create that value separation for them. But going back just a few years ago, I wouldn't have said the kinds of customers that we had today would be in the program. And as the snowball of McKesson's generic buy gets bigger and bigger when we roll down the hill, we have the ability to pick up more and more customers, and more and more volume, and more and more efficiencies. And the example I gave you on Protonix is a good one, is that... hopefully we will have advantages that sometimes they can't replicate and we'll continue to move upstream from a sourcing perspective.
Charles Boorady - Citigroup: Thanks.
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. Larry Marsh, your line is open. Please state your company name.
Larry Marsh - Lehman Brothers: Thanks. This is Larry at Lehman. Just wanted to... maybe a clarification if I could from Jeff. It is interesting, the wording I guess you used in the press release about the tax rate. You're saying McKesson's expected tax rate for the year remains 33%. And I guess, I read that is saying you expect your effective tax rate for fiscal '08 to be 33%, but if I heard you correctly you're saying no, if you assume that you got a good guy this quarter, next quarter will be 33%. So your effective tax rate for fiscal '08 might be something like 31%, is that right?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: It's a very good question, Larry, and I guess I'm confusing people with terminology. When we use the term effective tax rate, when you hear me use the term 33% that means that our tax rate for the year would be 33% if there were no unusual one-time items. If you take our pre-tax income, multiply it by 33%, bang, that's the tax rate. Now, the world it doesn't really work that way, because we have 1100 tax returns we filed… we are continually settling things with tax authorities. So, you have to each quarter in addition to booking that 33%, book whatever the one-time adjustments are, that you would incur in that quarter. So you could look at our year-to-date tax rate and I think if you look at our year-to-date tax rate of the press tables today, it's around 31.9% or so. So that tells you that 1.1-point differential is the net one-time good guy. For the fourth quarter we'll start by assuming we're going to book at 33% for the quarter. But we'll probably have some modest interruption in the fourth quarter as well. So I would call that 33.9% [inaudible] I would call it the reported rate versus the effective rate, if there were no one time items. So hopefully that clarifies it and doesn't confuse it more.
Larry Marsh - Lehman Brothers: Okay. No. That does. And just in the… on that point, when you restricted the cash with the settlement in fiscal '06. You also segregated any income you would made off of that. Is that right? So you are not going to be impacted negatively, the fact that you have actually paid out the cash--.
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: All of the income accrued to the plaintiffs.
Larry Marsh - Lehman Brothers: Right. Okay. And then I guess for John may be for Jeff another sort of thought process, let’s sort of step back four to five years for McKesson there was always a fair amount of predictability Q1, Q2 into Q3 and Q4 and obviously what you're saying is given the change in the market both with generics and now with the structure of these price agreements there tends to be more volatility quarter-to-quarter. Then I guess, we are… we would be used to seeing going back a couple of years. Is that a fair statement and as we sort of think about going forward the next year or two, is that going to increase or decrease given we're not going to have the massive new generics that we did with the three-year call out you gave us last year?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: There are several questions there Larry, I think that the… if you actually look at us and the way we think about our business it is actually more predictable than it used to be particularly on an annual kind of a basis, these relationships that we have with manufacturers are much less sensitive to what they might do on their own with price announced to us. And what that does is it allows us to understand the stability of our business. So although it may look like we still have significant variation in our business, it's really driven today by two primary factors. One is the seasonality remains that we used to have, as that still remains one of the key timing points for our historical funding of both branded price increases in the past and the new agreements to date. And then… and so that seasonality is remaining. And the second thing is that on occasion manufacturers will change from historical behavior and that makes the sink with the prior period… prior year prior period out of whack and that's what we were trying to explain last quarter was that if you looked at the third quarter last year some manufacturers had increases in the second quarter this year that would have otherwise happened in the third quarter. And so those are the things that they can move around on us a little bit. But I actually think that the business is more predictable today. In the past we had to guess what the manufacturers are going to do with price increases and it had a propound effect on our business. Today the guess is more around when exactly will it happen as opposed to if it will.
Larry Marsh - Lehman Brothers: Okay. And then I guess finally. I know I asked this last quarter as well, but you call that the fact that you were supplier of the year for CVS and obviously important relationship for the industry and I know you don't like to talk about specific customers but you as a manager would you hope to have some resolution of that long-standing agreement well before June of '09 or is that totally up to the customer, I should be asking Tom Ryan.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, you know the answer to that. You should be asking Tom Ryan. Not speaking specifically about CVS, our goal is to have long-term relationships with all of our customers and to earn the privilege of continuing those relationships overtime. Sometimes they choose to go through a process where they reselect and sometimes they just basically sit down with you and over a handshake and a cup of coffee will renew relationships for a long period and it's too early to tell at least in my mind what… any specific customer that hasn't made that decision yet is likely to do. But our goal is to continue to earn the business day in and day out with all of our customers including CVS and to continue to earn the privilege of extending those relationships should they expire.
Operator: Thank you. John Ransom. your line is open and please state your company name.
John Ransom - Raymond James: Yes, hi it's Raymond James. Looking at your adjusted SG&A cost in your distribution segments for the quarter, is this kind of the new normal level? I mean, it was frankly a lot higher than what we were modeling, a lot higher sequentially but are there any… we took the $16 million out, but even after doing that the numbers were higher than where we were. Is this kind of the number we should look at more important considering OTN and some of the other things you're doing?
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think the short answer is, yes. So you've got an addition to a lot of growth… 15% revenue growth in the US business. You also had a lot of growth and exchange rates in the Canadian business so that's the piece of it. And then, you've got OTN as well as our continued investment in retail automation. So, the only one of those that we don't control that might change is the Canadian dollar and that could bring it back down, but other than that I'd use it as a new base.
John Ransom - Raymond James: Well, I mean, if we do the math, if we just take your EBIT, now EBIT and then plough through the normal tax rate and interest, I mean, the numbers this quarter in our model were about $0.11 lower than what we were doing and all the delta was coming out of the SG&A line. So, the market did anticipate the SG&A step up, was the SG&A step up in line with your expectations but the markets just didn't catch on because that was really the big delta when you work through all the charges and all the tax rates, that EBIT numbers were lower really because of pharma SG&A jumped somewhat sequentially.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I don't know what your numbers are, and what the market expectation might have been. If you add back the unusual items including the non-tax deductible --
John Ransom - Raymond James: Yes, that's what… on the EBIT line, the taxes don't matter. So we added all the charges back and the operating profit numbers were lower and the delta all looks like it came out of the big jump sequentially in pharma and distribution EBIT and SG&A… excuse me, distribution SG&A. And that's were, I mean, I don't want to do the brain damage on the tax rate, but just the EBIT was lower than some of the models. And it look like just a big step up in distribution SG&A. And that were… after being flat for a couple of quarters sequentially it jumped up a lot and that's just where we were a little bit cut off relative to our own expectations.
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: It's hard to comment on the model. I think I'd just come back to if you were actually on track to a little bit above where we thought we'd be when we started this year and our guidance is above where we were when we started the year and that's even absorbing the $0.11 of charges, the $0.05, or $0.06 of OTN dilution. And there is a partial offset to those because our tax rate is a little lower than when we thought, thought at the beginning of the year, we have still one-time charges, but that $0.10 to $0.12 versus between the charges in OTN, you've got $0.17 or $0.18. So we feel pretty good about the operating results for the business relative to where we--.
John Ransom - Raymond James: And you're accepting this, you are expecting this to take sequential up tick in SG&A, in your expectation?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Again I guess… I would rather just look at the overall bottom line and say that we are comfortable and actually doing a little bit better than we thought we would be doing as we started the year.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I think maybe what's getting… because we have OTN in the business now and the expense associated with that business, perhaps that's where your model didn't have it and I don't know if you did... if you took the charges out and you put OTN in, then it is in line with what we had anticipated and with revenue growth as high as the revenue growth it drives incremental expenses. We can't offset all of that volume without incremental transportation expense and warehousing expense etcetera. So perhaps that's what's doing it. But if you actually look at the underlying cost structure of our distribution business, it's very well managed and we have great controls and we are getting great leverage in our back-office operations, on any one quarter you may see some noise in it, particularly because of these unusual things that flow through on occasion. But as Jeff mentioned, we are really pleased that our guidance can be where it is, after we have shown these purposeful negative hit status, like the restructurings and the conscious purchase of OTN, which all of those are drags in our performance and yet we are still really good… really in good position to finish strong for the year.
John Ransom - Raymond James: And my other question, going to the IT business, just a little more context, if you would on the charge you took and what's your... I know you have mentioned general comments about just aligning the businesses, but is this just trying to make per say better into the integrated whole and taking a chance to remove some duplication? I was just struggling to understand the restructuring charge there and exactly what you are after the longer-term?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: You may recall that when we… as we were buying per se, we created a new segment called McKesson Technology Solutions and MTS is actually the combination of the old provider technology business, the creation that really help part of which is ex or old per say and the addition of the payor segment, moving it from distribution into this category. What that afforded us an opportunity to do is completely rethink our structure around management organization, around development activities, product construction, etcetera. And we purposefully said, always we wanted [ph] we're going to find ways to take cost out and take that overlap and streamline our processes. And so that's really what the charges resulted those continued views and some of that certainly might have been related to per se, but a lot of that was just related to the marginal look at the whole business to say what do we need, as we start to finish this year and try to enter '09 with a strong run at it.
Operator: Ricky Goldwasser. Please state your company name and you may ask your question.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS: UBS. And thank you for letting into the call. Just a few clarification questions, maybe I'm sorry [inaudible]. In fact, first of all, is this $3.22 to $3.32 of guidance is based on $0.68 in the quarter? And then secondly, if I look at an adjusted $0.79, are you backing the $0.11 back. Does that include a tax benefit, which we kind of calculated with $0.79. So it an ongoing basis, the adjusted number should really be $0.72 and then lastly, on Protonix I know it's been brought up a lot on this call. But I understand that you're not factoring interest conscious in your guidance, but now that you have the product in your warehouse, is Protonix now in this $3.22 to $3.32?
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: I think maybe we went backwards. Protonix is certainly in the guidance that we have just given you. The guidance is GAAP-based guidance, so it is based on the $0.68 this quarter and we think of the tax rate as… our expectation will be 33 for Q4, and we're pretty pleased by our efforts to work with the IRS and get some of the settlements we have. It's all in the GAAP results.
Operator: Our next and last question comes from Eric Coldwell. Please state your company name and you may ask your question.
Eric Coldwell - Robert W. Baird: It's Baird, being last I think everybody has covered my questions, so I'll bid you a good night. Thanks for the call.
Jeffrey C. Campbell - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Great. Thanks, Eric.
John H. Hammergren - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Eric and thanks everyone for joining us on our call today. McKesson continued to have positive market momentum in our third quarter and with revenues up 15% and great progress across all of our businesses. We're really pleased with our excellent results for the first three quarters and we are now in our traditional strongest quarter. We remain very excited about our unique offering across healthcare and our ability to turn that into value for our customers and our shareholders. And I'll now hand the call over to Larry to give us a view of the upcoming events. Thank you.
Larry Kurtz - Vice President, Investor Relations: Thanks, John. I have my usual preview of upcoming events, but first I'd like to make some personal comments. As many of you already know, I'll be retiring from McKesson early June after 11 years with the company. It's been a tremendous pleasure and terrific experience for me to work not only with my McKesson colleagues but also with all my friends in the financial community. I have great respect for the work you do to understand our company and our industry so that you can make informed recommendations and decisions for the people you advise and whose money you manage. Thanks to all of you for making the past 11 years. So, personally and professionally rewarding and so much fun. This is my last quarterly call as McKesson's Vice President of Investor Relations that's number 43 if you're counting. In mid-March Ana Schrank will succeed me as Vice President of Investor Relations. I will provide support and counsel to her during my final months here as she transitions into the position. Many of you know Ana from the three years she spent as Director of Investor Relations before moving on to her most recent position as Head of Credit for McKesson for the past four years where she made some very important contribution to the company. I know you will show her the same patience and respect that you've shown me these many years, and I wish both Ana and you continued great fortune. It's our plan to host a going-away party of sorts when we are in New York City in June for our Annual Investor Day and I look forward to seeing you all then to thank you personally for the support and good humor we've shared over the years. In closing, here are the upcoming activities we have for the financial community. On February 6th, we will present at the Merrill Lynch Global Pharmaceutical Conference in New York City; on February 25th, we will host our traditional Booth Side Briefing at the annual HIMSS meeting in Orlando; on March 19th, we will present at the Lehman Brothers Healthcare Conference in Miami. We plan to release and hold our call for fiscal 2008 fourth quarter results in the first week of May. Thank you and until we see each other in June, goodbye and take care.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect from the audio portion. Thank you for your participation.

As a public dialogue about improving healthcare access andcost gross, healthcare services continues to be a great place to be andMcKesson is well positioned to deliver solutions for our customers and createvalue for our shareholders. Both our segments are achieving steady balanced revenuegrowth, which we can leverage into annual operating margin expansion. Ourstrong balance sheet, solid cash flow and diverse and flexible capital deploymentstrategy provide additional opportunities to grow EPS. I'm very pleased withthe progress we continue to make across the company. In Distribution Solutions our U.S. pharmaceutical distributionrevenues grew 9% in the quarter reflecting continued solid growth in both themarket and in our customer base. I'm especially pleased with our revenue growththis quarter, which reflects our attractive business model and our diversity ofcustomers including our strong position in mail order segments, which continuesto be one of the fastest growing parts of the market. Our Distribution Solutions operating profit margin expandedfour basis points over the last year. That is also an impressive performanceconsidering that the second quarter a year ago included the positive effects oflaunches of several major generic drugs, a $10 million dollar anti-trustsettlement and a $10 million dollar LIFO credit none of which recurred in thesecond quarter of this year. Our results this quarter reflect our continued greatrelationships with our pharmaceutical-manufacturing partners both branded andgeneric. Our teams continue to execute well to deliver benefits to both themanufacturers and our partners. Our agreements with branded manufacturers were a particularlyimportant driver of our strong profit growth this quarter. In additionreplacing a significant amount of generic product profit from the secondquarter of a year ago was a challenge this quarter. Our team that manages our product acquisitions and relationshipswith generic pharmaceutical manufacturers executed very well and exceeded theirgoals in the quarter. Our generic programs are delivering great value to ourcustomers and in return we are seeing increase participation and increasedcompliance. The number of pharmacies in our proprietary One Stop programincreased 13% to 10,500 from 9300 inthe second quarter a year ago, reflecting increased participation across a widerange of customers with particular progress in our base of regional chains andhospital group purchasing organizations. For example our new agreements with Kinney Drugs, which has90 stores in upstate New York and Vermont and Wegmans, which has 71 stores inthe Mid-Atlantic states now include supplying generics in addition to brandedpharmaceuticals. ShopKo, a Wisconsin based chain with 135 stores in 13 statesrecently closed its warehouse and now uses McKesson for both branded andgeneric deliveries to its pharmacies. We also signed a division of ShopKo called Pamida, which has126 pharmacies in the Midwest and Mid-South to a new contract that now includesgeneric supplies. We recently renewed our agreements with Costco and Target andthey continue to purchase their generics from McKesson. And I mentioned on our last call that the Broadlane HospitalGPO now also participates in generic plan for institutions as do several otherGPO’s. Our independent pharmacy customer base also continues toexpand. These pharmacies buy virtually 100% of their generic productrequirements from McKesson and equally important they are among our bestcustomers for the valuable higher margin products and services we provide toenable them to compete on a level playing field with much larger pharmacies. This expanding base of generics customers provides a strongfoundation for our future growth. We continue to expect that over the nextthree years the large number of scheduled patent expirations for major brandedpharmaceuticals represent a significant profit opportunity for the company. Of course to be able to provide the value-adding productsand services such as generics, first our customers must have confidence thatthey are receiving the best possible service. We are currently achieving thehighest service levels we have ever achieved, more than 95% of our orders arefilled on an unadjusted basis the first time while inventory write offs and baddebts are at historical lows. Contract and charge-back accuracy is at a historic high. Webelieve that we represent best in class operating performance in what isprobably the most efficient and safest supply chain in the world. Our customers appreciate this high level of quality. We werechosen Pharmacy Supplier of the Year and Overall Corporate Supplier of the Yearfor 2006 by CVS Caremark, the largest dispenser of prescription medicine in theUnited States and the nation's largest retail drug store chain, all for ourinventory management capabilities and our commitment to customer service. Our relationship with CVS actually began in 1996 with acontract to supply the CVS pharma-care mail order operation. We've been theexclusive distributor of pharmaceuticals to Caremark since 2001 and we've beensupplying CVS pharmacies since 2004 when they acquired the Eckerd Storesserviced by McKesson, and they chose to continue that relationship. Our relationship has since expanded when CVS acquired theSavon and Osco stores of Albertsons, which were previously McKesson customers.Subsequently we were awarded distribution contracts for a portion of CVSwarehouse business and later for the pharma-care specialty business. CVS Caremark is now our largest pharmaceutical distributioncustomer. They are also one of our largest customers for our RelayHealthintelligent network and claims processing services. As we look ahead to the longer-term growth potential for thedistribution segment McKesson is well represented in the North Americanpharmaceutical and medical surgery distribution markets. In the United Stateswe have a balanced portfolio of pharmaceutical distribution businesses with asignificant share of customers in national and regional retail drug chains,mass merchandisers and food and drug combos, mail order, long-term care,hospitals and independent pharmacies. We are also well positioned in the fastest growing sectorsof the medical surgical products market, physician offices, clinics, surgerycenters, long-term care and home healthcare. In Canadaour pharmaceutical distribution business is evenly balanced among the variousclasses of customers that are using distributors and we own 49% of the largestpharmaceutical distributor in Mexico. Looking at the market one additional area we targetedstrategically to expand our position in is specialty distribution. Sales ofspecialty drugs are increasing rapidly, especially oncology drugs. More than 200 oncology drugs are in development cross thepharmaceutical and biotechnology industry representing more than 50% of the newdrug pipeline. Between 2006 and 2010 sales of oncology drugs are forecasted byIMS Health to increase from $30 billion to $60 billion dollars. Our specialty business has been growing rapidly, but from asmall base and a sub-scale cost structure. By our recently announcedacquisition of OTN and combining that acquisition with our existing specialtybusiness, we now have an enhanced position in the fastest growing area of themarket with a more competitive footprint of services and a more competitivecost structure. OTN is one of the nation's largest distributors of specialtydrug products serving the need of more than 3500 oncologists, 1500rheumatologists and many other providers with annualized revenues ofapproximately $3 billion dollars. Because of its broad range of capabilities and position inthe market OTN was a coveted asset. We will experience some marginal dilutionas we restructure the combined business over the next 12 months, but we feel itcompletes our balanced market participation with a much stronger products andservice offering in this key area. Now turning to Technology Solutions, we had revenue growthof 36% in the quarter driven by 52% growth in our services revenues, much ofwhich was due to the acquisition of Per-Se Technologies. The integration ofPer-Se, which is going very well and the move of our payer business into TechnologySolutions this year reflect the portfolio approach we use to deliver sustainedgrowth and margin expansion in this segment. Our goal over the long-term is to leverage our uniquesoftware and services technologies, broad offering a large install base ofcustomers to deliver above market growth with more predictability and lessrisk. Before highlighting some of the individual accomplishmentsworth noting let me describe the focus of McKesson Technologies Solutions infour key areas to expand the market for healthcare information products andservices. McKesson provider technologies addresses the needs of hospital andphysician offices for clinical, financial, administrative and many othersolutions to improve the quality and cost of healthcare. RelayHealth provides connectivity solutions to providers,pharmacies, and payers to align patient care with financial flows, McKessonHealth Solutions provides commercial and government payers with software andservices designed to optimize their operations and health out comes forpatients, and our international group provides software and services to theEuropean healthcare market. In every case we are providing customized solutions thatcombine parts of our offerings within or across the four areas of MTS, and forthat matter across all of the businesses of McKesson. Now let me briefly review the major highlights within theMcKesson Technology Solutions portfolio. The McKesson provider technologies ourhospital customers are continuing to demand solutions to support clinical andpatient safety initiatives and connectivity including Horizon Medical Imaging,Horizon Cardiology and Horizon Expert Orders but as more and more hospitalsnear the completion of the re-engineering of their clinical work flows withsoftware and automation we already see them looking ahead to utilize the newdata gathering capabilities of these clinical solutions to improve theirperformance. We are seeing increasing demand for newer solutions such asHorizon Performance Manager, our analytics tool, which enables customers to usethe data captured in their systems to make improvements in clinical,organizational and financial performance. Now along the same lines our OR Benchmarks Collaborative hasaggregated data for more than 2.5 million surgical cases from 350 participatinghospitals cross the United States and Canada. This solution provides a web-baseddashboard that enables hospitals to measure and compare their operating roomperformance to that of similar facilities across all of North America. We are seeing continued demand among our physician customersfor solutions that integrate practice management through electronic healthrecords. We have a unique strategy to meet the demand in a way that responds tothe financial needs of physicians, which I will address shortly. Now turning to RelayHealth, we are seeing growth and demandfor solutions that leverage our overall customer relationships and connectivityassets. During the quarter RelayHealth signed a multi-year renewal of itsagreement with Wal-Mart stores to provide pharmacy network and value-addedservices reflecting quality and reliability of our offering for this importantcustomer. RelayHealth is also a key component of our new providerTechnology Solutions for physician offices called Practice Partner Complete,which is a hosted service offering designed to remove the hurdle of capitalinvestment by physicians, which is obviously one of the barriers to adoption toelectronic health records. It is our goal over the time to increase our servicesrevenue stream and this is a perfect opportunity. Practice Partner Completecombines our highly rated Practice Partner software and billing and accountsreceivable management services from provider technologies with RelayHealth'selectronic transaction processing. The attractiveness of Practice Partner Complete's businessmodel is enhanced by the strong reputation for quality and track record forsuccess of the component parts of the solution. The Practice Partner Suite,which integrates with practice management systems, received top rankings forthe fourth consecutive year from the AC Group. Now many of you know that we are already providing billingand collection services to approximately 17,000 U.S. physicians, that servicereceived the North Face Score Board Award for the fourth straight year. Thisannual award recognizes organizations that are rated only by the customer consistentlyexceed expectations in the areas of customer service and support. Health care is being transformed by several factors that aretogether shifting more of the payment responsibility to the patient andcreating the need to better manage a much larger number of high volume, lowvalue financial transactions. A partnership of JPMorgan Chase was announcedlast quarter. RelayHealth has also signed a strategic partnership with theBank of America who shares our commitment to delivering improved electronicpayment processing and healthcare. Both of these partners are well-respectedfinancial institutions and have a large footprint of healthcare customers. Through these relationships together with Relay’s healthproducts and services we plan to integrate the administrative clinical andfinancial healthcare transactions to streamline, maximize and accelerate bothpayor and consumer payment flows. McKesson is the only company capable of providing such anintegrated solution for healthcare. RelayHealth today processes more than $1trillion dollars in healthcare billing transactions annually on its intelligentnetwork. Earlier today we announced a RelayHealth’s new payor-directinitiative focused on providing the most comprehensive connectivity for payorsin the healthcare industry has now been launched. Our payor-direct initiativewill remove the intermediate steps that exist today between payors and theirprovider networks in the financial transactions process. We expect this initiative will reduce costs and improve cashflow for both providers and insurers and accelerate our growth. Because wedeliver more than traditional EDI, health plans will gain a competitiveadvantage by offering services that increase member and provider interactionand their satisfaction. Now turning to McKesson Health Solutions, the focus is alsoon measuring and improving operating performance and on cost management. Oursuite of claims performance products continues to sell very well and our diseasemanagement business continues to grow. In the second quarter McKesson Health Solutions renewed itsagreement with the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare to provide diseasemanagement and primary care case management programs to the states eligibleMedicaid children and adults who suffer with some of the most serious andcostly chronic diseases. McKesson health solutions also renewed its agreement withthe New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services to provide diseasemanagement services to eligible New Hampshire Medicaid clients. Our program with New Hampshirerecently received the 2007 Outstanding Government Program, Disease ManagementLeadership award from the Disease Management Association of America. Whilepositive results cross the board including return on investment, reduction ofemergency department admissions and high levels of beneficiary satisfaction. Finally in our in international group we continue to makegreat progress with the implementation of our new payroll of human resourcesinformation system for the National Health Services at Englandand Wales.During the quarter we passed a milestone of 1 million employees receiving theirpaychecks through our system. We believe that our NHS Solution is the largestoutsourced payroll system in the world and we are on schedule to haveprofitability from this contract beginning in fiscal 2009. In summary we have great momentum across McKesson throughthe first two quarters of fiscal 2008. Both Distribution Solutions and TechnologySolutions are demonstrating their potential for value creation. Our strongbalance sheet and solid operating cash flow provides resources to further thecreation of addition shareholder value. Based on our results for our year-to-date and our momentumwe are raising our fiscal 2008 guidance range to $3.22 to $3.37 for earningsper diluted share for the continuing operations excluding adjustments to theSecurities Litigation Reserves and restructuring charges. I look forward toreporting to you on our results for the final two quarters. With that I turn the call over to Jeff and will return toaddress your questions when he finishes. Jeff?
Jeff Campbell: Thank you, John, and good afternoon everyone. McKesson had astrong second quarter performance, especially in light of the challengingcomparisons we faced from the second quarter a year ago. Great execution isdriving our operating results and we are achieving good return from our capitaldeployment strategies to increase shareholder value. As always let me first begin by reviewing the consolidatedincome statement. Revenue for the quarter grew 9% to $24.5 billion, from $22.4billion dollars a year ago. Distribution Solutions revenues which, given theirsize, are always the primary driver for overall revenue growth, grew 9%. Andour Technology Solutions revenues grew 36%, benefiting from the acquisition ofPer-Se Technologies. Overall gross profit for the quarter was up 15% to $1.2billion dollars. While we had a nice increase in our Distribution Solutionsgross margin, the primary driver of the 15% consolidated increase in grossprofit versus our revenue growth of 9% was our higher Technology Solutionsgross profit driven by the Per-Se acquisition. Moving below the gross profit line our total operatingexpenses were up 14% to $827 million dollars for the quarter, excluding theimpact of adjustments to our Securities Litigation Reserves. The 14% expensegrowth in the quarter primarily reflects the growth rate of the business andthe impact of acquisition of Per-Se plus $12 million dollars of incremental FAS123R expenses versus a year ago. Our results this year do include a positive pre-taxadjustment to our Securities Litigation Reserves of $5 million dollars,reflecting the net impact of several settlements. Our fiscal 2007 resultsincluded a similar credit of $6 million dollars. One of this year's settlementsresulted in the dismissal of the Bear Stearns appeal of the McKesson settlementof the Federal Securities consolidated action. As a result of the elimination of this last condition to theMcKesson settlement our December quarter financial statements will reflect theremoval of $962 million dollars of restricted cash reported on the balancesheet along with the related liability. Operating income of $359 million dollarsin the quarter was 17% above last year, great leverage on our revenue growth of9%. Moving below operating income, our interest expense of $36million dollars was $14 million dollars greater than the prior year due to the$1 billion dollars in additional debt, which we used to finance a portion ofour Per-Se acquisition. Other income of $36 million dollars was little changedfrom a year ago. McKesson reported a tax rate of 31.2% in the quarter and ourexpected effective tax rate for the year is now 33%, a downward adjustment fromthe 34% to 35% range originally expected. The adjustment to 33% reflects thecompany's growing mix of foreign versus domestic income. The reported tax ratefor the quarter primarily reflects a two-quarter catch up to the new expectedannual rate. On a GAAP basis this quarter we had net income of $247million dollars, or $0.83 per diluted share, compared to $229 million dollars or$0.75 per diluted share a year ago. For the fiscal second quarter earnings perdiluted share of $0.83 included the positive impact of the $5 million dollars pretaxcredit to the Securities Litigation Reserves, or $0.01 per diluted share. Second quarter earnings per diluted share of $0.75 a yearago included an after tax loss from continued operations, excuse me, fromdiscontinued operations of $0.19 per diluted share, primarily from the sale ofMcKesson's acute care medical surgical business and favorable adjustments tothe Securities Litigation Reserves of $0.28 per diluted share primarily due toa credit to income tax expense resulting from an adjustment to a tax reserve. Our income from continuing operations in the quarterexcluding adjustments to Securities Litigation Reserves was $244 million dollarsor 22% above last year. In the quarter we had diluted earnings per share fromcontinuing operations excluding adjustments to Securities Litigation Reservesof $0.82, or 24% above last year's $0.66, clearly a very strong performance. To wrap up our consolidated results in the quarter, ourdiluted EPS calculation was based on 299 million weighted-average dilutedshares outstanding compared to 305 million in the prior year. The number ofshares used in this calculation declined due to the cumulative impact of ourshare repurchases. Let's now move on to our two operating segments. Indistribution solutions for the quarter we achieved solid revenue growth of 9%,driven primarily by the 9% growth in our U.S.pharmaceutical direct distribution and services revenues, which, as Johndiscussed, we are particularly pleased with. Our Canadian revenues increased 15% for the quarterincluding a favorable currency impact of 8% given the record strength of theCanadian dollar. We continue to see great overall performance in our Canadianbusiness. Medical surgical distribution revenues were up 11% for the quarter,primarily reflecting market growth. Our U.S. pharmaceutical sales mix for the quarter was 31%institutional, 23% retail change, 13% independents, and 33% warehouse, that breakdown a year ago was 29% institutional, 24% retail chains, 13% independence and34% warehouse. Gross profit of $848 million dollars was up 10% from $769million dollars in the second quarter a year ago. And as John mentioned gross profit in the second quarter ayear ago included the positive impacts of an anti-trust settlement of $10million and a LIFO credit of $10 million, excluding the $20 million dollar impactfrom prior year results, gross profit would have increased 13% showing niceleverage on our 9% revenue growth. The key drivers to this gross profit result in the quarterwere an improved mix of higher margin products and services including profitgrowth in our proprietary generics programs and the impact of our agreementswith branded pharmaceutical manufacturers, the compensation from which as we'vediscussed in the past can vary unpredictably from quarter-to-quarter. Our distribution solutions operating expenses were up 10%for the quarter to $491 million dollars. Operating expenses in the segment wereprimarily driven by revenue growth but were also impacted by higher expenses inour retail Pharmacy Systems automation business as a result of our Per-Seacquisition. Operating margin for the quarter was 154 basis pointscompared to 150 basis points in the prior year. Adjusting for the $10 million dollaranti-trust settlement and $10 million dollar LIFO credit in the prior year,operating margin increased 13 basis points. Now turning to technology solutions, revenues were up 36%for the quarter to $712 million dollars reflecting the impact of Per-Serevenues and continued growth and implementations of software and imagingsolutions for hospitals, clinics and physician offices. Service revenues whichnow account for 76% of total revenues in this segment were up 52% to $538million dollars. Software and software systems revenues, which now accountfor just 19% of revenue, were up 4% to $139 million dollars. Gross profitmargin in the segment of 46.8% with 180 basis points below last year was largelydue to our higher mix of service revenues. Technology solutions expensesincreased 31% in the quarter to $270 million dollars. Higher expenses were driven by Per-Se operating expenses,incremental FAS 123R expenses of $6 million dollars compared to the prior year,and continued investments in new product development. The quarter technologysolutions had total gross R&D spending of $91.4 million, an increase of 18%for from the prior year. Of this gross amount, we capitalized just 11% thisyear compared to 21% a year ago. The lower capitalization rate in the quarter was primarilydue to the write-off of some software related R&D in our McKesson Health Solutionsbusiness without which our operating profit and operating margin rate wouldhave been higher this quarter. Operating profit in Technology Solutions thisquarter was $66 million dollars, up 27% from $52 million dollars a year ago. Our operating margin was 9.27% compared to 9.9% in thesecond quarter a year ago. Now I'd remind you that there is some quarterlyvolatility in our operating profit in this segment due mostly to the timing ofrevenue recognition across the segment, but we are still focused on ourlong-term goal of an annual margin rate in the low to mid-teens. While we don'texpect to be in this range for fiscal year 2008 we will begin to approach asignificant improvement from the 9.2% rate for fiscal year 2007. Leaving our segment performance and turning briefly now tothe balance sheet, on the working capital side our receivables increased 14% to$6.8 billion dollars versus $6 billion dollars a year ago, our Day Sales Outstandingincreased by one day going from 21 to 22 days. Our inventories were $8.3billion dollars on September 30, a7% increase over last year, but below our sales increase of 9%. Our day sales and inventory of 32 was just one day lowerthan last year. Compared to a year ago payables were up 13% to $11.8 billiondollars. Our day sales and payables increased by two days going from 44 to 46days. Year-to-date, driven by these positive working capitalresults, we generated $1.3 billion dollars in operating cash flow. We actuallyhad a net reduction in working capital year-to-date and we are roughly flatversus a year ago despite our 9% revenue growth. This demonstrates the strong cash generating character ofour evolved pharmaceutical distribution model. That said, I would remind youthat there is seasonality in our use of working capital and we do tends to usecash in our third fiscal quarter. However, with the strong year to date results we arecertainly comfortable that we will exceed our previously announced annualexpectation of generating over $1 billion dollars of operating cash flow forthe fiscal year. Year-to-date capital spending was $83 million dollars, higherthan the $51 million dollars a year ago, primarily due to distribution centerupdates and higher technology infrastructure spending. Capitalized software expenditures were $78 million dollars,down from $86 million dollars a year ago. We ended the quarter with $2.5billion dollars in cash, up $564 million dollars from our fiscal year ends ofMarch, 2007. Consistent with our portfolio strategy for capital deployment year-to-datewe have repurchased $684 million dollars of shares, invested $51 million dollarsin acquisitions, paid $36 million dollars in dividends and made $161 million dollarsof internal investments. With the Board of Directors approving a new additional $1billion dollar share repurchase authorization, we now have $1.3 billion dollarsof share repurchase authorization outstanding. We ended the quarter with agross debt to capital ratio of 23.4%. After the quarter ended we completed our acquisition of OTNfor approximately $575 million dollars in cash, which will now be reflected inour third quarter financial statements. So overall based on our strongyear-to-date results we are raising our earnings guidance from continuingoperations now expect to earn between $3.22 and $3.37 per diluted share for thefiscal year ending March 31, 2008. Our new guidance is based in part on the continued beliefthat we will have a strong fourth quarter tempered by the fact that we will nowhave dilution from the results of OTN for two quarters. Our guidance does notinclude the impact of any securities litigation reserve adjustments, anypotential future acquisitions, divestitures, material restructurings orintegration related actions. We remain very positive on the health of our business andthe industry in general. We have great financial flexibility, which provides usa good opportunity to continue our capital deployment strategy to enhanceshareholder value. Thanks. And with that, I will turn the call over to theoperator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you, we will now begin the Question and Answersession. (Operator Instructions) Ourfirst question will be from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Your line is open. You maynow ask your question.
Lisa Gill - JPMorgan: Great, thank you, and good afternoon. Jeff, just walkingback through some thoughts around the guidance that you just gave, obviouslyyou raised it by $0.07. In my estimate OTN will cost you maybe $0.03 to $0.04which would put overall raise from the initial guidance in my mind of $0.10 to$0.11 of which about $0.06 is coming from tax. So as I kind of step back andsay 4% to 5% of it is from operations and this quarter you beat consensus on anoperations side by about $0.06. How should I be thinking about the next couple of quarters?Is there something that I am missing here? And when we think about drugdistribution, is it the fact that the price increases came through in July andmaybe we won't see as much in January? I know you don't like to answerquestions about guidance but maybe if you can just help me to better understandthis.
Jeff Campbell: No, Lisa in fact I think you have got the components fairlywell laid out. The way I would go through it relative to our initial guidanceis clearly we've had a strong first half performance, particularly in our U.S.pharmaceutical distribution business. And our view is that some portion of that strength is justtiming. So it's borrowing from what we thought would happen in the back halfand putting it into the front half and some portion of it is reflective of realcontinued strength that will show up in our year end results. You got a balance that against OTN, which we closed franklymore quickly than we had initially thought. So we'll now have about two fullquarters of dilution from OTN. And while there's lots of uncertainty there andour goal is to make the integration happen very quickly and get at thesynergies the dilution in our estimate for fiscal '08 is probably more in the,around $0.06 range. And this number is probably somewhat similar for '09.Certainly our goal is to beat that but that's what's in our thinking as we gothrough rest of the year. And then as you say you've got the tax good guy whichdoes add about $0.05. So it's the interplay of those effects that leads us tothe range that we've given you.
Lisa Gill - JPMorgan: Okay. great. And then just as a follow up to that as we lookat drug distribution in general our anticipation would have been that U.S.would have come in lower than the 9% that you produced in the quarter. Can you just maybe talk about the impact of the Medicaredrug benefit or some other things that were positively impacting last year and whatwe are seeing, and what we should expect in the next couple of quarters, as wemove into the doughnut hole should we expect that the growth won't be as greatin the back half of the year?
John Hammergren: Lisa, we see really good momentum in our pharmaceuticaldistribution business. We actually have a pretty positive outlook on our viewon the business and I think that the Medicare Part D uptake has been largely Ithink lapped by us although it's still a very good volume aspect in ourindustry. I don't know what effect the doughnut hole will have on usbut we remain optimistic that we’ll continue to grow at or above the marketlevels because of our mix of customers that we think are frankly growing nicelyand the second as we mentioned in this conversation today, we are increasingour position in our existing customers. We are taking on generic sales where they may have not purchasedgenerics from us in the past and we are taking warehousing business where theymay not have, they may have had their own warehouse in the past, I mentionedboth of those examples in my prepared comments. So I think we are optimisticabout the position we are in and the revenue growth outlook remains a positive.
Lisa Gill - JPMorgan: Great, thanks, John and Jeff and congratulations on thecontinued strong execution by McKesson. 
John Hammergren: Thank you, Lisa.
Operator: Our next question is from Glen Santangelo of Credit Suisse.Your line is open you may ask a question.
Glen Santangelo -Credit Suisse: Yes, John, I just had two quick follow up questions on theIT division. It kind of says in the press release that you guys have spent over$160 million dollars year-to-date investing in this business and capitalizedexpenditures and capitalized software. Is that maybe a little bit more than youthought you would have spent maybe six months ago and how should I think aboutthat level of investment spending as we move into the back half of the year? 
John Hammergren: Well, I think that we, other than a relatively small write-downof some software in our McKesson Health Solutions business that Jeff mentionedin the call I think that our spend is pretty much on line with what we expectedit to be. Maybe what's the difference here is we are combining all ofthis into one segment now called MTS and the second thing is we've got Per-Sein there. So the inflation in the numbers is probably driven by theconsolidation of the sectors and the acquisition of Per-Se rather than a hugeramp in R&D spending. 
Glen Santangelo -Credit Suisse: And then kind of as a follow up to that, Jeff, maybe if youcould talk about the magnitude of the write-off this quarter in the softwareside? 
Jeff Campbell: Well, I think, Glen, the way I would probably think about itif you go back to the numbers that I cited in my remarks, we spent grossR&D dollars of about $91 million dollars this quarter. That itself was up18% from the prior year. A part of that is the acquisition of Per-Se and part of itis the combination of the payor business, McKesson Health Solutions and MTS andpart of it is just continued step-up in spending. This year we only capitalized11% of that total whereas in prior years you'd see, in prior quarters you'd seeus running in the 20% to 25% range. So the simple math tells you that's aboutan $8 to $10 million dollar switch.
Glen Santangelo -Credit Suisse: Okay. And then just my last question, Jeff, in terms of theguidance you were suggesting that we'll see the margin sort of gravitate not somuch in fiscal '08 but move more in fiscal '09, was that the point you weretrying to make?
Jeff Campbell: You're talking about the Technology Solutions?
Glen Santangelo -Credit Suisse: Yes, exactly.
Jeff Campbell: So the point I'm trying to make there is that we continue tohave our long-term goal of low to mid-teens. And that's an annual numberbecause of the quarterly volatility in that margin. While we don't expect toget into that range for fiscal '08 we'll make tremendous progress and we'llbegin to get closer, pretty darn close to the range when you look at the wholeyear calendar '08. We haven't given guidance yet beyond '08 but certainly asJohn really focused in his remarks, our goal in all of our businesses is tocontinually get operating leverage.
Glen Santangelo -Credit Suisse: Okay. Thanks for the comments.
Jeff Campbell: Thank you.
John Hammergren: Next question.
Operator: And your next question is from Tom Gallucci of MerrillLynch. Your line is open.
Tom Gallucci -Merrill Lynch: Good evening, thanks. First, John, I just wanted to makesure when you talked about Kinney and Wegmans and a few of the others there wasthe implication that you hadn't done generics for those regional chains in thepast and now you have, now you have the contract to do that?
John Hammergren: That's correct.
Tom Gallucci -Merrill Lynch: Okay. Can you maybe just to generalize a little bit butwhat's sort of the trigger in this time frame to move that many, decent sizecustomers over on to your generics program?
John Hammergren: Well, as we've talked about in the past we've been heavilyfocused on moving up the food chain from a generic perspective, in other wordsgetting more and more customers buying from our programs. And it's acombination of our ability to package the programs and position them properlyin the customers eyes, a combination of our ability to source the productcompetitively and make sure they've got great pricing and probably lastly tothe highlight to our customers the efficiencies they gain by basically doingaway from their own sourcing for generics, the man power associated with itplus the logistics associated with managing their own buy. It's not inconsequential to have to buy the stuff directly,manage it through their own warehousing cycles, get it out to their stores ontime, and deal with the service requirements on a store level. Most of ourlarge retail customers are heavily focused on managing the front end of theirstores and are increasingly saying to us, why don't you help us with thepharmacy operations in a holistic way. The supply chain to the pharmacy, the transaction processingin the pharmacy, the systems in the pharmacy, the automation in the pharmacyand McKesson really stands in a great position to completely envelop basicallya total solution for the pharmacy operations to improve their financialperformance and the quality of their output to their customers. So I think, its multiple things coming together at once andwe expect the momentum in generics to continue. But once again I highlightedthese are existing customers of McKesson's that are expanding their footprintwith us.
Tom Gallucci -Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then just finally on the branded side, youstressed a few different times the importance of some of the arrangements withmanufacturers. Can you just give us a little bit more color in terms of whathappened this quarter that seemed to have some of that money kick in? Was itjust price increases? Was there performance metrics that you sort of get paidoff on? Just give us a bit more detail on what's going on there? Thanks.
John Hammergren: As you know, these agreements are each individuallyconstructed and developed at the manufacturers. Clearly volume is a componentof our performance with good revenue growth, everything else also is impactedfrom a performance perspective. And the agreements are structured in such a fashion in manycases so we get the benefit of performing against the obligations and theopportunities under those agreements and I think there's some variabilityaround performance from a manufacturer perspective. So we continue to believe that we execute very well. Wedeveloped agreements with our customers that provide a mutual benefit for bothof us to win together as we perform. And it pays off in the end. Now clearlyprice increases also are a component of the value that you see this quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Does that conclude your question?
Tom Gallucci -Merrill Lynch: Yes, thank you.
Operator: Thank you, next question is from Larry Marsh of LehmanBrothers. Your line is open.
Larry Marsh - LehmanBrothers: Thanks and good afternoon everybody. I just had one broadquestion and then maybe a specific follow up. John maybe you could just remindus, there's been some commentary the last couple of months that a slow down inscript growth in the drug industry has proceeded at a negative impact on thedrug wholesalers, which I wouldn't necessarily agree with. Obviously your results this quarter would show both top linegrowth and good margin trends. Could you comment about that and how we shouldthink about changes in industry volume as relates to your business?
John Hammergren: It's a good question, Larry. Clearly I received some of thesame questions during the quarter because of some discussions that had takenplace with various participants in the industry not the least of which was Ithink was IMS who had published data around script growth. We frankly don't look at the weekly, monthly and quarterlydata as much as we look at sort of the annual trends in the forecast. And Ithink any, as you might guess anybody's forecast is always wrong, it's aquestion of which side of it they are wrong on. I believe that the industry is poised for continued solidgrowth. There's nothing from a demographic or from a public policy perspectivethat should put the breaks on the opportunities for us to continue to grow froma revenue perspective, as an industry. And furthermore, I think if we’re able to capitalize asdistributors on the opportunity to bring more and more of that business thatsits outside of our channel through the wholesaling business we stand in verygood position to continue to grow in a nice balanced and profitable way. So I frankly, wedon't sit down and have large group meetings over script volumes every quarteror week when we see them. We believe that the trends over the long haulcontinue to be very positive.
Larry Marsh - LehmanBrothers: Okay. Thanks and just a clarification of some of thecomments you made within the call about your being announced as the CVSCaremark Supplier of the Year. Congratulations. I guess the question I have,obviously your biggest customer as you acknowledged, you haven't disclosed howbig particularly but are there any opportunities to expand the relationshipwith this longstanding set of customers now under the CVS Caremark umbrella andis there any opportunity to try to extend the relationship before you hit thedeadline of June of '09 or is that probably outside your control or set instone?
John Hammergren: You've been working with us for a long time, Larry. You knowwe never talk about what our customers are likely to do. We are privileged tohave the opportunity to service them and we try to earn our position in ourclient’s base every day and feel strongly that the decision is ultimately intheir hands in terms of who they do business with. I guess the purpose of the discussion today was really tohighlight because some of you had questions about our relationship with CVS. Ithink people believe that we were in a very small position at CVS and what Iwas trying to highlight is that we have a very significant position at thecombined CVS Caremark and that had we perform very well for them. And those awards were not just for the pharmacy. Those were awardsin particularly one of them as Supplier of the Year was not just a pharmacy award;it was for their entire business beating out the OTC and the front shop kindsof participants as well. So I just want to point out that we are recognized by CVSand their management team for the high quality that we deliver and we clearlyhave other points of value that we are bringing in there today like ourRelayHealth transaction processing capabilities and in the past we talked withCVS and Caremark about our automation capabilities and other kinds of servicesand we continue to hope to work with them to continue to service their needs aswe go forward.
Larry Marsh - LehmanBrothers: Okay. And this is all a clarification I guess for Jeff,you're communicating it looks like as you said $0.06 of dilution from OTN andmaybe that's a couple cents more than what you had thought when you first madethe announcement back in early October. Is there any way to give us any clarification as to whatsome of your assumptions are around tangibles and length of amortization nowthat it's closed?
Jeff Campbell: Well, the short answer, Larry, is no, because I don't knowwhat the intangibles number is yet. Obviously that builds an assumption intothat $0.06. Feeling this change since we announced the acquisition is we wereable to close it remarkably fast and so we had not initially expected to havemuch more than one quarter of results in '08 and now we are going to havepretty much two full quarters in fiscal '08. I was a little hesitant to give that $0.06 number justbecause we haven't, we won't even know what that intangible number is going tobe for a little while for sure. But that's really the assumption that's builtinto the number that we've shared with you today.
Larry Marsh - LehmanBrothers: Are you assuming any sort of closings consolidation in thator is that again too soon to tell?
Jeff Campbell: Clearly we have two overlapping businesses where we intendto move very aggressively to create value and put together the strength of thetwo companies. That is liable to drive some one-time kind of costs, which arenot included necessarily in the guidance. This is the guidance is really meantto be for continuing ops and excluding one time sort of stuff.
Larry Marsh - LehmanBrothers: Okay. All right, I will stop there. Thanks.
Jeff Campbell: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser ofUBS. You may ask your question.
Ricky Goldwasser -UBS: Thank you. A few follow up questions. Jeff, just to clarifyon the question of what it looks like the outlook for the next couple ofquarters, when we think about December quarter from a sequential perspective,should we assume the differences is one obviously OTN which seems to be about$0.03 diluted to the quarter and the other moving part that is impact afterbeing a decision intact from branded inflation?
Jeff Campbell: Well, I will make a couple points. We of course don'tprovide quarterly guidance. We focused on annual guidance because that's theway we run the business and our ability to predict quarter-to-quarter numbersis imperfect because of the nature of the way our agreements work in ourpharmaceutical distribution business because in our software and servicesbusinesses.  Our view is we want to develop and maintain long-termcustomer relationships and we don't want to get into the game of having toclose business on the last day of the quarter to make a number. Now all that said, our March quarter has historically byquite a stretch been the company's strongest quarter and that's due to both theway most of our agreements work in the pharmaceutical distribution business andfrankly the way sort of these sales structure and compensation programs are setin most of our software and services businesses. All of those things build towards a very strong Marchquarter and we’d expect that same sort of back weighting today if you take whatwe've earned year-to-date, combine that with our annual guidance and thenpretty heavily back-end weighted for that March quarter in-line with historicalpatterns.
Ricky Goldwasser -UBS: And the growth we see with your proprietary generic programin the quarter given that it sounds like you have new customers or at leastcustomers that are adding this program, that impact, that growth we shouldcontinue to see on a year-over-year basis and should be pretty similarsequentially?
Jeff Campbell: Sure. But that doesn't impact necessarily the quarterlyprogression and clearly that's one of the strengths built into the guidancewe've given you.
Ricky Goldwasser -UBS: Okay. And then just to clarify I think you mentioned, Imight have missed it, were there any one time benefits or offsets that arefactored into the 1.54% of operating margins for drug distribution?
Jeff Campbell: No.
Ricky Goldwasser -UBS: Okay. Thank you.
Jeff Campbell: Thank you, Ricky.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bret Jones of LeerinkSwann. Your line is open you may ask your question.
Bret Jones - LeerinkSwann: Hi, good evening, it's Bret Jones for George Hill. I waskind of looking at the Technology Solutions revenue, the top line there lookeda little bit weaker than what we were expecting. I was wondering if you guys could comment maybe on the packbusiness we heard a lot of the hardware in pack vendors consistently say theyare feeling impact from the DRA and it’s even spilling over into the in-patientside and I was wondering if you guys were seeing a similar trend.
John Hammergren: We are pleased with the progress we are making in ourtechnology business and as Jeff mentioned it's difficult to predict everyquarter what's going to close and how it's going to roll into revenues or intoearnings in that business, but we think we are very well-positioned and as alsoJeff noted we are making great progress as our strategy has been directing usto move more and more of our focus on the services side of the business andless dependent on the quarterly flow of contracts for software. That said, as you know we have one of the strongest packsproducts in the marketplace and we've now expanded that offering to includecardiology packs. The packs market clearly has been penetrated over the years,but we believe there is still more buying going on and there also is areplacement cycle under way and the cardiology cycle I think is just beginning,so we are optimistic. The growth rates have come down but the business is stillgrowing.
Bret Jones - LeerinkSwann: All right, great. I was wondering is there, can you breakout the organic growth of Technology Solutions ex Per-Se.
John Hammergren: That's almost impossible for us to do, Brett, given thatbusiness inside of Per-Se or the businesses of Per-Se are now dismantled andinside of our various businesses inside of McKesson. I, clearly the Per-Se acquisition had an impact on servicesand other businesses where it was significantly larger than our current assets.But in many of the software areas where we combined surgery software or wecombined other services it would be almost impossible for us to go back andreconstruct the same historic kind of growth.
Bret Jones - LeerinkSwann: All right, fair enough. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Halper of ThomasWeisel Partners. Your line is open you may ask your question.
Steve Halper - ThomasWeisel Partners: Hi, could you provide a framework for us in terms of whatyou're thinking about the long-term operating margin for the DistributionSolutions you had previously before the pieces moved around talked about arange of 150 to 200 basis points. Is that still where you would like to be?
John Hammergren: Clearly our goal hasn't changed or we probably would havesaid something about it. I think we continue to make progress against ourexpectations and we made progress again this quarter by four basis points andif you did it on an on apples-for-apples the growth in basis points it was morelike 13. So, I think that's great progress actually from an operatingmargin expansion on the base of business that we have. One of the clearchallenges we have in margin expansion is the faster growth of our lower margincustomers and the fact that we have to focus on that as an offset to the continuedincrease and uptake of generics and more profitable products. So, I think our guidance will remain unchanged on thatfactor and we feel like we are making progress.
Steve Halper - ThomasWeisel Partners: Okay. And then just on the Per-Se pharmacy softwarebusiness, is that a Distribution Solutions or is that, is that in TechnologySolutions?
Jeff Campbell: Yes, Steve, the relatively small retail pharmacy softwarebusiness is the one piece of Per-Se that is in Distribution Solutions. So it'ssmall enough so for simplicity we pointed out to people they can just model itas putting all of Per-Se into Technology Solutions. When I called it out today because when you look at just theoperating expense line in Distributions Solutions and the changeyear-over-year, no, it's a small piece that the retail Pharmacy Systemsbusiness is enough to add a couple of points to that expense growth rate.
Steve Halper - ThomasWeisel Partners: And how is that business doing? I'm assuming you have a lotmore muscle and clout into the retail pharmacy customer base, whereas yourPer-Se didn't have that area of expertise. So, how are you doing with selling that software piece intoyour pharma-customers?
John Hammergren: I think we are making very good progress. It hasn't impactedour operating profit in the pharmaceutical distribution segment yet. So, the150 to 154 was driven really by the distribution businesses performance. That said, we continue to invest heavily in the Pharmacy Systemsbusiness and we now have roughly 25% of the retail market, I believe, on astore basis running on our software behind the counter to operate thesepharmacies. So, we think of it as a significant opportunity for us tocontinue to grow our footprint. There's a significant opportunity for us to usethe cross-selling that exists between our distribution sales force and ourtechnology sales force to bring a more complete solution to our customer baseand to effect the performance of our customers, which is really our number onegoal here is to make McKesson customers the most profitable customers in thebusiness.
Steve Halper - ThomasWeisel Partners: Thanks.
John Hammergren: And to answer the question on performance, those assets areperforming well. We had a little bit of an issue, Steve, in our mail ordersoftware business, which is a real small sub-part of the systems businessesthat we acquired and we've been investing heavily in that.  That's part of the expense drag you've seen in the lastcouple of quarters has been our manpower behind that mail order softwareproduct.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from Eric Coldwell, Robert W.Baird. Your line is open.
Eric Coldwell -Robert W. Baird: Thanks very much. I want to follow up a little bit onSteve’s last question with, John, your comments that Pharmacy Systems now hasin the neighborhood of 25% of the market, I'm hoping you can help us get abetter sense of what that market opportunity is today, perhaps size the marketfor us to help put that in perspective and then as follow on just trying to geta sense of retail Pharmacy Systems overall operating profit contribution? You’ve talked in the last couple of quarters about somemargin pressure there given the investment the recent comments here on themail-order piece. Where is that division in terms of operating profitabilitytoday within Distribution Solutions?
John Hammergren: Eric I got that the question on the pharmacy software and Ican address that, what was the second part of the question on margin pressure?
Eric Coldwell -Robert W. Baird: Well, in the last couple of quarters you’ve highlighted thatyour Distribution Solutions margin might have been even a little bit better ifit weren't for the OPEX within Pharmacy Systems. So, I'm just trying to get a sense, is Pharmacy Systemsprofitable today? There's a wide range of market competitors profitability inthat space, anywhere from negative 20% EBIT to plus 15% EBIT. I'm trying to geta sense of where you stand in the market and how big that market really is?
John Hammergren: I think the market unto itself would probably not have beensomething that McKesson would have been attracted to as a stand alone businessopportunity, selling pharmacy software into retail pharmacy. As a part of McKesson we think it's another strategic assetthat helps round out our portfolio and certainly rounds out our conversationwith our customers. So, on a per revenue per transaction basis that we get outof selling Pharmacy Systems software I'd have to tell you that it's reallyimmaterial to us. In terms of the strategy it's more material because we canhave this larger scale discussion with our customers. As to the reason whysomething that is somewhat immaterial to us financially suddenly is material on an expense perspective enough forus to talk about it really is an investment, tens of millions, not hundreds ofmillions, in making these products world class. And we think its really incumbent upon us if we want alongstanding high performance relationship with our retail customers to deliversoftware that fits their needs and maybe even that software investment won'tget a great, terrific short-term return, but the overall relationship with thecustomer will and that's why we are investing in it. We are probably spending more on the mail order softwareproduct than we would have otherwise if we weren't already in the mail orderbusiness in a big way from a distribution perspective. So that should give you sortof a sense about it.
Eric Coldwell -Robert W. Baird: You've given a lot of great granularity on the call todayand we appreciate that. I'm trying to against a sense if you see that totalretail pharmacy system market, is it $0.5 billion in the U.S., is it a $1billion dollar opportunity in the U.S.? You did comment that you don't see it as a great stand alonebusiness, but I'm trying to get a sense on where you are in that market today.
John Hammergren: If it was a $.5 billion dollar software opportunity we wouldbe pretty excited about it. I don't think it's quite that big. I mean clearlysoftware businesses carry a larger margin and you can't compare those revenues…
Eric Coldwell -Robert W. Baird: Right.
John Hammergren: Distribution revenues, but I think you should thinking of itas a strategic asset for us that augments our overall retail pharmacy valueoffering as opposed to something that will move the needle for the corporationor even for the distribution segment. In terms of Pharmacy Systems revenue or Pharmacy Systemsprofit, as a part of the overall relationship, is it important? Absolutely, isit something that we'll call out in a special page and say that drove of ournumbers? I highly doubt it. The opportunity is pretty well understood by us and it'spretty bounded and I know there are other players in the market that are prettysmall in this segment but I think the reason why we are attracted to it isbecause we are scaled in the systems business already and we are also scaled inpharmacy distribution and we have a footprint with these customers that'simportant in a more all encompassing way.
Eric Coldwell -Robert W. Baird: That's fantastic, a quick follow-up. You in the past havegiven some of the growth rates on your proprietary generics program andobviously you announced some nice wins this quarter and my assumption is it’sgrowing quite nicely. Can you give us the growth rate of the proprietarygenerics program this period?
John Hammergren: I talked about the growth and the number of stores that are nowusing the product. Revenues in the business this particular quarter are littlebit softer than we typically expect because we had a comparison to last yearwhere you had Plavix, Zocor, and Zoloft.
Eric Coldwell - RobertW. Baird: Right.
John Hammergren: Which were an inflating factor in generics, but revenuesgrew nicely in this quarter in generics. So, I think all-in-all we are pleasedwith the results, but to this issue of momentum in the generics we knew wewould have a couple of quarters here where the momentum in generics was goingto be little bit softer by comparison to prior year and that's what we beentalking about even before beginning this year.
Eric Coldwell -Robert W. Baird: Okay. Good job on the results.
John Hammergren: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from John Patrick Walsh ofWachovia Securities. Your line is open.
John Patrick Walsh -Wachovia Securities: Good afternoon, thank you, guys. You answered my operationalquestions. A question on the balance sheet, now that you have the restrictionlisted on the cash would your thoughts be to redeploy that cash kind of right away? And I think longer term I would be curious to where you would like to keepthe cash balance. Obviously it's been at a pretty high level here for a while.Should we look to that trending back somewhere towards $1.5 billion somethingin that ballpark?
Jeff Campbell: I think, let me make three comments, on the specificreference I made to the $962 million dollars in restricted cash, thatdisappears off our balance sheet and goes right into the hands of the plaintiffand ultimately the individual claimants in the class action relating back toHBOC. So that money is not available for our shareholders. Ourtarget cash balance longer term in the $1 billion to $1.5 billion range. Wecontinue to have a target capital structure of a gross debt to cap ratio in the30% to 40% range versus our current 23%. Clearly those two groups of specifics tell you we still havemore balance sheet strength to use to create value and we continue to befocused as a management team on making sure that we use that potential and getinto our target capital structure and into more of a normalized cash balancerange in the coming quarters.
John Patrick Walsh -Wachovia Securities: Great, and just one more question kind of a 20,000-footquestion. Obviously we're having here apolitical year and you have having all kinds of proposals on the healthcarefront in terms of the uninsured and obviously if Democrats take office you areprobably going to have more scrutiny on the pharmaceutical companies, just kindof your sense right now in terms of how you look at the government potentiallygetting more involved in the business and how that might impact you and theoverall outlook on the industry?
John Hammergren: Well, I'm pretty excited about the fact that the healthcareseems to be the number one debate item on the political circuit, setting asideclearly the war on terror. We’re excited about how we are positioned in thedebate. And clearly healthcare IT remains one of the fundamental tools thatwill be used by either party to control cost and to improve quality. Clearly our financial transactions business will fare verywell in an environment where you have the individual taking on moreresponsibility. And frankly, I think the pharmaceutical industry should besomewhat out of harms way in this new environment. If you look at what's happened to them from a genericperspective the industry has been completely recast and changed and I can'tthink of any politician, maybe I shouldn't say that, I can't think it would bea very good argument to say that the pharmaceutical companies are doing greatthings from a financial perspective on the backs of our taxpayers. So, I'm hopeful as we go through the cycle that the debatewill be on the right things and that's how to reengineer healthcare and ifthat's where it remains today frankly McKesson is well positioned for thatdebate.
John Patrick Walsh -Wachovia Securities: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be from Robert Willoughbyof Banc of America. Your line is open. 
Robert Willoughby -Banc of America Securities: Thanks. John or Jeff can you speak to the payor-directinitiative that you just announced today? With payors and providers maintaininginterface what is actually incremental there? I'm not sure I understand thatdevelopment there, because I thought you maintained a lot of these interfacesalready.
Jeff Campbell: We do have a large business there and roughly 60% or 70% ofthe volume that we manage already goes on a direct basis between us, betweenthe providers through us and on to the payors. We provide a value-add in thosetransactions because of the way the information is presented to both sides andthat's why we have a roll as an intermediary. First, a subset of our customer base, there were actuallyother business partners involved in those transactions and what we are announcingtoday is that those other business partners will no longer be necessary in thechannel and we will be able to eliminate the inefficiencies that are present asa result of their presence in those transaction channels. So, I think it's particularly good news for our customersboth the providers and the payors to smooth line the transactions. Clearlythere's a incremental business opportunity for us here today, but I think ourannouncement today was really focused on making sure that our customers understoodthat we are out there trying to make it easier for them.
Robert Willoughby -Banc of America Securities: And what is example of an intermediary whose being removed,is it just another claims processor of some sort that's being dis-intermediated?
Jeff Campbell: Right, other claims processors, some that are automated andsome that do paper based claims processing that work on these transactions; ourgoal is to be close to 95% or better of these transactions running only throughMcKesson's RelayHealth network point-to-point.
Robert Willoughby -Banc of America Securities: And just to step up how do I think about that? That isremoving a handful of these guys that are out there, it should ultimately bemore profitable for you? I mean what's the, how do I think about the economicsfor you in that development?
Jeff Campbell: Well, clearly it should be more profitable for us and italso should save people like Aetna money that don't have to pay others to bepart of the transaction. So, I think it should be a win for us and certainly awin for our customers. Clearly the people that may be on the losing end of that arepeople that are no longer necessary in the channel.
Robert Willoughby -Banc of America Securities: And you are viewing that as maybe 30% or 40% of thetransactions might have gone through some of these other intermediaries?
Jeff Campbell: Probably more in the 20% to 25% range and there's still abunch of manual transactions that we are in the process of automating.
Robert Willoughby -Banc of America Securities: Okay. That's great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, our next question is from Barbara Ryan ofDeutsche Bank. Your line is open you may ask you question.
Barbara Ryan -Deutsche Bank: Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question, just a coupleof bookkeeping things. I don't know whether you mentioned what the OneStopgenerics program was up in the quarter?
John Hammergren: Our OneStop performance, not only did we sign new customers,but we continue to grow the profitability of that program in the quarter so, weare pleased with our results. We had a very difficult compare, though.
Barbara Ryan -Deutsche Bank: Right.
John Hammergren: So, I want to point that out. And I think there were several,several positive things in the quarter our revenue momentum was strong. Ourperformances in our branded contracts were very strong and our performance ingenerics was stronger than we anticipated given that we had this difficult lapwe had to accomplish. So, we are very pleased with how we ended up.
Barbara Ryan -Deutsche Bank: And then so you are not going to give us an exactpercentage, John, for the generics program in the quarter?
John Hammergren: No, I'm not but I think it was it's moderately up bycomparison to the prior years.
Barbara Ryan -Deutsche Bank: Conversions have a really tough comparison, I understand.I'm just wondering if you can update us on the Health Mart program and what thenumbers there are for stores, keeping track of that.
John Hammergren: Yes, Health Mart continued to make progress and I think weprobably picked up another 100, 150 stores in the quarter. That momentum isgoing to begin to slow as we penetrate those customers that are most suited forthe program. We clearly still, so the total is in the 1800 to thereabouts kindof range. We still have several thousand stores on Value Rite and thenas I mentioned we have over 10,000 people buying, stores that are buying ourgenerics, select generics programs. And people like Costco that might be on ourgenerics program are probably not going to re-brand their pharmacies HealthMart. So there are multiple points of value that we get out of thegenerics program including Health Mart franchises and others.
Barbara Ryan -Deutsche Bank: Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.
John Hammergren: Well, thank you Barbara, I really appreciate and I think weare out of time, operator. We've run a little bit over because I know we hadsome people that wanted some questions. I want to thank all of you that were onthe call today. I think we are a off to a very solid start to the first twoquarters of the year. We remain extremely excited about our unique offerings acrosshealthcare and our ability to turn that into value for our customers andobviously value for our shareholders. We are well positioned, as with finish this year and we’relooking forward to continued strong performance. Now, I will hand the call offto Larry to talk about upcoming events for the financial community.
Larry Kurtz: Thanks and we’ve got a few to cover so bear with me. I knowwe’ve gone a little over here but we wanted to do address as many of thosequestions as we could. On November 6, we'll be at the CIBC Healthcare Conferencein New York City, on November 14, we will present at the CSFB Healthcare Conferencein Phoenix, on November 27, we will present at the Merrill Lynch HealthcareServices Conference at their offices in New York City; on December 3, we willhost our traditional booth side briefing at the ASHP mid-year meeting in LasVegas. A number of you asked me about this because you didn't seethe announcement. We are not having a briefing at the annual RSNA show as wedid the past two years in Chicago.We are going to include a discussion of our medical imaging business a littlelonger discussion of it in our annual HIMS briefing. That will be February 25th in Orlando. That will come upagain on our next call. On January 7th we will be at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conferenceup the street from us here in San Francisco. And we plan to release and holdour call for our fiscal 2008 third quarter results in late January. So, thanksfor your patience. We didn't wreck your Halloween this year. Have a greatevening and have a great Halloween tomorrow, thanks and take care.

Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to McKesson Corporation Fiscal 2008 First Quarter conference call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. Today’s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Mr. Larry Kurtz, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. 
Larry Kurtz: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the McKesson Fiscal 2008 First Quarter conference call for the financial community. With me today are John Hammergren, McKesson’s Chairman and CEO; and Jeff Campbell our CFO. John will provide a business update and will then introduce Jeff, who will reveiew the financial results for the quarter. After Jeff’s comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour, at 6:00 p.m. EDT.  Before we begin, I caution listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company’s periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities & Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements.  Thanks, and here’s John Hammergren. 
John Hammergren: Thanks, Larry, and thanks, everyone for joining us on our call today. McKesson is off to another solid start in Fiscal 2008, continuing our momentum of the past two years with revenues for the first quarter up 5% and earnings per diluted share up 28% to $0.77. We had a terrific performance in our Technology Solutions segment, where both revenues and operating profit were up strongly from continued progress across the business and the integration of our Per-Se Technology acquisition.  In Distribution Solutions, our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution business grew solidly and we continue to achieve operating margin expansion.  Across McKesson, we continue to focus on growing operating profit by leveraging our revenue growth through a combination of operating efficiencies, acquisitions, increased sales of value-adding products and services to our customers, and capital deployed for share repurchases. In the quarter, we had cash flow from operations of $432 million and we repurchased $257 million of our stock. Based on our performance in the first quarter and our positive view about the business, we are reaffirming our outlook that we expect to earn between $3.15 and $3.30 per diluted share for the full year.  I will briefly touch upon the business highlights and key trends before turning the call over to Jeff for a more detailed review of our financial performance.  Our Distribution Solutions segment, which is anchored by U.S. pharmaceutical distribution, had revenue growth of 4%. The market trends driving our revenue growth remain very positive. Our U.S. healthcare direct distribution revenues increased 6% in the quarter, but that includes the impact of our termination of the OTN contract in mid-May a year ago, which had annual revenues of $3.3 billion. Factoring out the impact of the OTN revenue loss, our direct distribution revenues grew about 10%.  Our warehouse sales, which represent business with a handful of large customers, can fluctuate and did so this quarter. Warehouse sales were up 2%. The Distribution Solutions segment also includes our Pharmaceutical distribution business in Canada and our alternate site and Medical-Surgical distribution business, both of which are leading physicians in their respective markets. Both of tehse businesses had one less week of sales this year versus last year. Normalizing for one fewer week, (inaudible) sales were up 6% and Medical-Surgical revenues were up 10%.  Taking all tehse factors into account, we are pelased with our Distribution Solutions revenue growth this quarter and our momentum for the remainder of the fiscal year.  Distribution Solutions operating profit was up 9% in the quarter and operating margin expanded by six basis points, driven in part by an improved mix of higher margined products and services. For example, our sales of OneStop generics programs were up 34% in the quarter; well above our market growth. Our goal is to continue to grow our generic sales faster than the market, through a combination of more customers entering our proprietary programs and increased buying compliance among our customers.  Increased level of compalince is being driven by the significant multi-year investment we made in Information Systems. We are now using the systems to manage not only our generics business, but our Pharmaceutical distribution business overall. We believe that our systems are a competitive advantage for McKesson.  We recently held our annual Pharmacy Strategies conference for independent retail customers where we feature the many value-adding programs we offer to improve their performance, including our OneStop program. Other parts of the offering include our Access Health Managed Care program, pharmacy automation technologies, our front end enhancements, which now include a diabetes support program, as well as a unique partnership with Proctor & Gamble. And, of course, our Health Mark franchise, which continues to grow and now numbers more than 1,600 pharmaceis.  These value adding products and services are a win/win/win for our customers, our supplier partners and for McKesson, and enable us to expand the dialogue about opportunities for mutual growth. At ouir Pharmacy Strategies event for the financial commuhnity, we provided some performance metrics for Health Mark customers, which underscore the impact we can have on their business. On average, a Health Mark pharmacy has annual sales of $2.7 million compared to $2.4 million for our other independent retail customers. The same store growth is 3% above the growth rate of our non-Health Mark independent pharmacies.  These customers are extremely loyal to McKesson. For example, the ratio of generic dollars spent to total Rx purchases is 15.8% for a Health Mark customer. Based on the share of revenues accounted for by generics in the overall U.S. pharmaceutical market, this ratio implies virtually 100% compliance to our Health Mark customers.  Two days before our Pharmacies Strategy confrerence began, CMS published the final details of the implementation of new metric – Average Manufacturer Price or AMP. AMP is scheduled to be used in reimbursing pharmacies for Medicaid prescriptions beginning January 1, 2008.  Although AMP will have no direct impact on McKesson, the final rule was in line with our expectations. We are continuing to work with our trade groups, our customers, our Washington constituents, all of which to ensure the best possible outcome for our customers. We are pleased to see that CMS is actively encouraging the states to provide increased dispensing fees for prescriptions to Medicaid patients, and a number of states have legislation underway to do just that.  The market changes such as AMP also create business opportunities. It’s far too early to predict how the new rule will impact our custoemrs, but to the extent that it pressures their profit margins, we can offer them a variety of strategies, including the Health Mark franchise program as a way to offset that impact and even improve their overall performance.  In summary, we see solid revenue growth across our customer base with favorable market trends driving the growth of our Health Mark franchise and the expansion of our generics programs. We continue to focus on productive relationships with our branded pharmaceutical manufactures, sales discipline and operating process improvements to deliver efficiencies; all of which are designed to achieve operating margin expansion.  Turning to our Technology Solution segment, we are already seeing the benefits from our acquisition of Per-Se Technologies into our existing healthcare information solutions business, which continues to make great progress. We see solid demand for our clinical information solutions, both inside and outside our traditional core hospital base. We had several major multi-product wins in the quarter and our go-lives and clinical installations were up 13% compared to a year ago to a record 234 sites, including a significant number of new installations of Horizon Expert Documentation, our highly rated solution for nursing. We also had strong sales of our Physician Office Management software, which has been a focus of our market expansion.  We continue to see strength and demand for medical imaging solutions. Our Horizon Medical Imaging product is doing well in the replacement market for first generation PAX technology. We are increasing our penetration of the small hospital and imaging clinic areas of the market. We see opportunities for growth with line extensions into departments such as cardiology, where our Horizon cardiology solutions are gaining traction.  The integration of our Per-Se acquisition is ahead of schedule. As I discussed on our previous call and as Pam Peir reviewed in depth at our most recent Investor Day, we combined the connectivity and claims processing assets of McKesson and Per-Se into a business that we branded Relay Health.  Relay Health is a unique and powerful integration of assets that has great growth potential. For example, we processed 2.27 billion transactions last quarter. We see an increasing demand for online health care transactions of all kinds, and during the quarter we announced a strategic partnership with JP Morgan Chase to offer an integrated set of electronic healthcare claim and payment processing solutions, beginning with the submission of the healthcare claim to the insurer, payment and detailed remittance back to the provider and an electronic statement to the patient. In addition, the relationship will support the management of payment, claim and enrollment content, and develop a single portal that can be accessed online by all key constitutents along the revenue cycle; simplifying access to key data that is highly fragmented today.  As part of our balanced approach to capital deployment, we continue to make strategic acquisitions that expand our offering into our large customer base to enhance our revenue growth. Shortly after the quarter ended, we announced an agreement to acquire Awarix and its enterprise patient care visibility system that provides color-coded, at-a-glance electronic whiteboards of the hospital’s floor plan stationed throughout the facility. The system identifies and helps to eliminate the bottlenecks that delay treatment and extend patient stays, thereby driving a high quality, efficient experience for each patient, while providing real-time feedback to the care team for better management of capacity and patient throughput.  Now this business isn’t big today, but we certainly think that through our sales force and our customer footprint, we’ll see great opportunities to pull additional revenue through our custoemrs.  Now it wouldn’t be a McKesson quarterly call if I didn’t provide an update on the latest product rankings from the class enterprises organization. The fact is, we are simply making continued great progress with this important indicator of customer satisfaction with our solutions. In the class mid-year top 20 report, McKesson had 19 products ranked in the top 3 in 24 categories, up from 16 in the top 3 a year ago. We had nine products named as category leaders; more than ever before.  Although we don’t expect to have a profit from our NHS contract until fiscal 2009, we continue to make great progress with our implementation. We now have more than two-thirds of the NHS sites operating with our new payroll and human resource information system, paying 830,000 healthcare employees in the United Kingdom.  Finally, our reorganization into two segments, including moving our McKesson Health Solutions Payer Software and Disease Management business from the distribution segment into Technology Solutions. The new organization more closely aligns the development of new offerings that connect the needs of payers and providers for information and financial flows. Both the software and disease management sides of the business are growing.  In disease management, under a number of contracts, we defer significant revenues into future periods, but we expense the costs as they are incurred. This quarter we recognized $21 million of revenues on a single contract, which helped further drive the dramatic margin expansion we saw for the segment as a whole.  Given the nature of the business that we acquired with Per-Se, growth of our NHS revenues and our expanding franchise in disease management, our service businesses and technology solutions have grown significantly, and provide McKesson with a strong base of recurrent revenues. The cash flow character of this business is also quite positive.  In summary, we’re off to a great start in fiscal 2008. Both of our segments are demonstrating their potential value creation. A strong balance sheet and a solid operating cash flow provide resources to further the creation of additional shareholder value.  On a final note, at our annual meeting held yesterday in San Francisco, stockholders voted their approval of our board of directors’ decision to declassify the board so that directors are now elected annually. The board made this recommendation in January at the same time that they amended the company’s charter to implement majority voting for the election of directors, and amended our shareholder rights plan so that it expired. These actions demonstrate our board’s continuing commitment to strong stockholder focused, contemporary corporate governance practices, which we believe are consistent with our goal of creating long-term, sustainable value from McKesson shareholders.  I look forward to reporting to you on our results as the year progresses. With that, I turn the call over to Jeff and we’ll return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff. 
Jeff Campbell: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As you just heard, McKesson had a solid first quarter and is off to a good start for the new fiscal year.  The first quarter we continued with the integration of our newly acquired businesses, and broadened our value proposition to customers, while investing in the future growth of our businesses. We continued to generate significant cash flow from operations to pursue our balanced capital deployment strategy.  In my remarks today, I will first review our consolidated GAAP results, after which I’ll provide more details on our two segments. Finally, before going to the questions, I’ll review the balance sheet, our cash flows, and briefly comment on our fiscal 2008 guidance.  Consolidated revenues for the quarter grew 5% to $24.5 billion from $23.3 billion last year. Our overall revenue growth is, of course, driven by the grown in Distribution Solutions, which was up 4% from last year. But we are clearly pleased with the 49% revenue growth in our technology solutions segment, which included the first full quarter of Per-Se Technologies.  Overall, gross profit for the quarter was up 18% to $1.2 billion, a great result on the 5% revenue growth. Gross profit increased 7% in Distribution Solutions, and 57% in Technology Solutions, providing gross profit margin expansion in both segments.  Moving below the gross profit line, our total operating expenses were up 13% to $821 million for the quarter, compared to the 18% gross profit increase for the quarter. The expense growth primarily reflects normal growth rates in the business, the first full quarter of Per-Se operating expenses, and $11 million of incremental FAS-123 expenses.  Operating income for the quarter grew 31% to $356 million from $272 million a year ago. This was great leverage on the 5% revenue growth.  Moving below operating income, our interest expense of $36 million was $14 million greater than the prior year due to the $1 billion in additional debt, which we used to finance a portion of our Per-Se acquisition.  Moving to taxes, we implemented FIN-48 this quarter. Our reported tax rate of 34% this year was lower than the 35.4% reported rate in the first quarter a year ago. We do continue to expect an annual tax rate for the year that’s within our previously announced guidance range of 34% to 35%.  On the balance sheet this quarter you may have noticed a shift of approximately $400 million from our current other liabilities to the other non-current liabilities category. This shift is due to the new FIN-48 reporting requirements for classifying tax accruals.  Other income of $37 million was essentially flat from a year ago. Results from discontinued operations in the first quarter totaled an after-tax charge of $1 million, which was associated with its September 2006 sale of our acute care Medical-Surgical business.  This quarter we had net income of $235 million, or $0.77 per share, compared to $184 million, or $0.60 per share a year ago.  Our diluted EPS calculation this quarter is based on $304 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, compared to $309 million in the prior year. The number of shares used in this calculation declined primarily due to the cumulative impact of our share repurchases. Let me remind you that we have repurchased a total of $2.2 billion of stock over the last nine quarters, including $257 million of stock repurchased in this year’s first quarter. We now have $743 million remaining on our current $1 billion share repurchase authorization.  Due to the strength of our operations and cash flows, we had a slightly lower sequential gross debt to capital ratio this quarter. We do remain committed to achieving, over time, a gross debt to capital ratio in the 30% to 40% range.  Let’s now move on to Distribution Solutions. In this segment, for the quarter, we achieved overall revenue growth of 4%, as compared to the same quarter of last year, the components of which John walked you through.  Our sales mix for the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 was 30% institutional, 23% retail chains, 13% independent, and 34% warehouse. That breakdown a year ago was 30% institutional, 22% retail chains, 13% independent, and 35% warehouse. Although we do not show a change in our institutional share year-over-year, our institutional segment includes both the mail order and hospital business, and we are seeing faster growth in the mail-order piece this segment. This does impact our margins, as mail order customers are among our largest, and therefore, as you would expect, somewhat lower margin customers.  Gross profit for the segment was up 7% to $822 million from $770 million a year ago on 4% revenue growth, representing a nice improvement in gross margin of eight basis points. The increase in gross profit for the quarter was due to an improved mix of higher margin products and services, including sales of one-stop generics, the impact of our agreement with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers, higher gross margin in medical/surgical products, and two anti-trust settlements, which totaled $14 million. Looking forward, we do not expect anymore anti-trust settlements for the remainder of this fiscal year.  The increase in gross profit was partially offset for this quarter by a marginally lower overall sell margin due to the evolving mix of our customers that I referenced earlier. Our overall gross profit a year ago included a LIFO credit of $10 million, and a $15 million charge associated with McKesson’s investment in Parada Systems.  Our Distribution Solutions operating expenses were up 6% for the quarter to $496 million, primarily reflecting growth in our pharmaceutical business. Our first quarter operating expenses a year ago included a $6 million charge associated with our investment in Parada Systems.  Operating margin rate for the quarter was 143 basis points, compared to 137 basis points in the prior year. In the quarter, our U.S. pharmaceutical margin rate expansion was somewhat offset by weaker operating results year-over-year in our medical/surgical business and our retail pharmacy systems and automation business.  In summary, and before I move on to technology solutions, we are very pleased with the revenue growth of our businesses within Distribution Solutions, and the margin expansion in our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution business. We expect greater contribution from our other businesses in the latter half of this fiscal year.  In technology solutions, our revenues were up 49% for the quarter to $730 million. With the acquisition of Per-Se, our progress with the NHS contract and the growth of disease management, the mix of our revenues has shifted to be much more heavily weighted toward services. As John noted, this shift provides a larger base of recurrent revenues with good margin and cash flow characteristics.  Service revenues, which now account for 76% of segment revenues, were up 67% to $553 million, due to a full quarter of Per-Se results in recognition of the $21 million of previously deferred revenue on a disease management contract.  Software and software systems revenues were up 16% to $138 million driven by strong demand and implementations of clinical software, as well as strong physician office software sales.  Gross profit margin in this segment was up 260 basis points to 48.6%. The primary driver of gross margin expansion was our acquisition of Per-Se, which has higher gross margins. Additionally, we are benefiting from our previous and continuing investments in R&D, sales, and marketing.  For the quarter, technology solutions had total gross R&D spending of $95 million, an increase of 32% from the prior year. Of this amount, we capitalized 21%, compared to 19% a year ago. This demonstrates our continued stepped up investment in R&D to continue on our strong growth trajectory.  Technology solutions operating expenses increased 34% in the quarter to $257 million, providing great leverage on the 49% sales increase. Higher expenses were driven by a full quarter of Per-Se and related integration costs, investments in R&D, and higher FAS-123 charges being allocated to this segment.  Our operating profit in our technology solutions segment this quarter was $100 million, up 178% from $36 million a year ago. While we are very pleased with this performance and the 13.7% operating margin, I would note that this quarter included the $21 million of disease management revenues recognized, for which the related expenses were previously recognized as incurred.  Our long-term goal, as we’ve discussed for some time, and most recently, at Investor Day, still remains, in this segment, to have annual operating margins in the low to mid teens. We will make significant progress towards that goal this fiscal year, but do not yet expect to be in the target range for the entire fiscal year.  Leaving our segment performance and turning briefly now to the balance sheet.  On the working capital side, our receivables were up 11% to $6.8 billion versus $6.1 billion a year ago. Our day sales outstanding increased one day from 21 to 22 days. Our inventories were $8 billion on June 30th, a 6% increase over last year. Our day sales and inventory of 31 was unchanged from a year ago.  Compared to a year ago, payables were up 7% to $11 billion. Our days sales and payables increased two days from a year to 43, reflecting primarily the growth of our generics business, which typically has longer payments terms.  In the quarter, we generated $431 million in operating cash flow. You can see an example this quarter of what we have been talking about for a while. With the change in our agreements with branded manufacturers, we are now able to grow our business with little to no incremental investment in working capital. This quarter, we actually reduced our working capital a bit.  Capital spending was $35 million for the quarter, $10 million higher than the $25 million a year ago. Capitalized software expenditures were down to $41 million from $48 million. Our annual guidance for capital and software expenditures in the $300 million to $350 million range remains unchanged.  We ended the quarter with $2.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, up from the $2 billion we held at year-end, so overall, our first quarter results were solid and on track.  Our EPS guidance range remains $3.15 to $3.30 per fully diluted share. We continue to expect between $0.19 to $0.21 of share-based compensation, and full year cash flow from operations in excess of $1 billion.  Let me, once again, remind you that we focus on annual EPS in our guidance, as there are fluctuations in the (inaudible) for this quarter, the recognition of revenues under disease management contracts. But let me note that some differentials will have a particular impact on comparisons in the next three quarters. First, we continue to have seasonality of compensation from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers, and this is weighted more heavily to the March quarter. Second, last summer’s launches of generic Zocor and Zoloft had a positive on profit in the September and December quarters a year ago. The July 2006 launch of generic Plavix further boosted profits in the September quarter a year ago.  This fiscal year in contrast, while we expect a number of generic product launches, many of these are currently expected to come to market later in the year and financially impact mostly our fiscal fourth quarter.  Third, whereas we had LFO credits of $10 million and $18 million in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2007, we don’t expect the same level of LFO credits in those credits this year. Taken together, these factors create challenging comparisons for us in the upcoming second and third quarters, but should also drive a very strong fiscal fourth quarter.  We continue to feel that McKesson is on track for another good year in line with our guidance. Thank you.  With that, I’ll turn the call over the operator for your questions. 
Operator: Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question and answer session. (Operator instructions) The first question comes from Lisa Gill. Your line is open. State your affiliation, please. 
Lisa Gill – JP Morganl: Hello. JP Morgan. Good morning. John or Jeff, I was wondering if maybe you could just address the disease management contract and if we back it out, the tech margins still look like they’re about 11.1% in the quarter, so just getting closer to that low teens number and turning much better than we expected. Can you just give us an idea of what’s driving that? Is it the Per-Se synergy capture coming on-line sooner than expected, or is there something else that’s driving that?  Secondly, John you talked about the fact that you signed a number of contracts that were multi-product on the IT side. Can you just talk about some of the cross-sell of the multi-products that you’re talking about, or what you’re seeing as far as the trend goes? 
John Hammergren: Thank you for the questions. We have made significant progress in our technology solutions segment, even setting aside the disease management contract, as you noted, Lisa. We’re very pleased with that progress, and it’s really coming from a myriad of factors, and it’s coming in spite of a significant increase in research and development expenses and selling expenses and other investments we’re making into the business. So, I am pleased, and it’s really coming in multiple areas.  Clearly, the strength in our ambulatory products and resource management products in the quarter were very strong. As you might recall, we talked about the power of our clinical products for some time, and we began about two years ago to start talking about the building presence we have in outside the hospital, creating a healthcare information company as opposed to just a hospital information company. So you’re beginning to see strength in ambulatory, the physician office markets. You’re beginning to see strength in revenue cycle management. We talked about Relay Health on the call and the power of our transaction businesses that we’re building, and clearly having the integration of Per-Se go well and be ahead of schedule is also fueling growth. I would say across the board, we see strength in that business, and we continue to believe that the disease management business will be very strong. It’s just going to be a little lumpier than the rest of the business, by the nature of the recognition of these contracts.  On the second part of your question, which was related to the other big deals we have going, we actually have them going across the board, and in the hospital marketplace in particular, we’re seeing great strength. We’re selling multiple products at the same time in these hospitals, and I think that people talk about our business and think about it as a clinical software business, because that’s what we’ve talked about. But, with the acquisitions of things like Aware-X, we might be creating additional pull-through opportunities that outside of what we would normally have seen, and it shows that we’re continuing to innovate beyond the boundaries of the typical software business.  Clearly, automation is a pull-through for us in the hospital marketplace. Our automation business continues to perform very well, and we’re pulling through Distribution Solutions into these combined customers.  Frankly, we’re beginning to do the same thing on the retail pharmacy space with a more integrated approach to the market and more value to be delivered. Clearly, as I mentioned, the ambulatory side, if you think about a physician today, they can buy distribution services from us, they can buy software from us, both office management software, as well as clinical software, and now they can outsource the whole operation to us. Really, no other single company can provide that platform of products to a physician office, so we’re really pleased with the pull-through we’re getting across the board. 
Lisa Gill – JP Morganl: Can you quantify that at all as far as the pull-through goes across your lines and products, whether it’s distribution or other IT products? 
John Hammergren: I think it’s probably difficult to do on a finite basis, but what you’ve seen from us for several years now is higher growth rates in the market in some of these categories, and it’s not so much a taking share necessarily. It’s further penetration of those customers. For example, our generic businesses, the fuel in that is really taking existing McKesson customers and getting them to sign up to our one-stop program and then making sure that our one-stop program is being robustly implemented using our systems.  I really think that our ability to understand the operations of our customer, help them improve their performance and their profitability, and bring a complete one McKesson solution, basically, to the table, allows us to win more than our fair share of the deals. 
Lisa Gill – JP Morganl: Thank you, John. 
John Hammergren: You’re welcome. 
Operator: The next question comes from Glen Santangelo. Your line is open. State your affiliation, please. 
Glen Santangelo – Credit Suisse: Yes, with Credit Suisse. John, just a quick question, following up on Lisa’s IT question. I’m kind of curious, when you did the Per-Se deal last year, at the time you suggested that it would be mutual to slightly diluted to fiscal ’08 earnings. Just listening to what you’re saying now about the margins going forward and the results you reported tonight, and now that you’ve owned the business for a little while. Is it fair to say that maybe things are a little better than maybe you initially thought? 
John Hammergren: Glen, I think they are better than what we originally thought and they’re ahead of the time schedule that we originally thought. But they really weren’t material to our results in the quarter in terms of getting the margin rate expansion and the other things that you’re seeing, although there’s some mix change there that Jeff noted that helps buoy the margins.  The business, frankly, is probably a little neutral to maybe a little marginally dilutive, as we said it would be. But the positive nature of the business in terms of its mix, and then, as we see the integration happening across the board in almost every one of the product categories, we see terrific momentum, and we see great interest from a customer-base perspective in some of these newer, more combined solutions.  I wouldn’t characterize our results in the quarter as being driven by Pro Se. I think it’s really the execution of the pre Pro Se businesses that really have driven a lot of our performance, with the exception of the ambulatory products. I think we probably are a little ahead in ambulatory physician software kinds of products in the quarter. Some of those platforms were made available to us, frankly, through the Pro Se acquisition in those small hospital market technologies. 
Glen Santangelo – Credit Suisse: John, just one follow-up on the disease management revenues. I may have missed this, but I don’t know if you guys commented in your prepared remarks. Over how many quarters had you recognized the expenses that are related to those revenues? 
Jeff Campbell: On this particular contract, Glen, there had been a buildup of expenses over a couple of years. There had also been some revenue recognized against those expenses, a fairly modest amount.  I think it’s important to realize we have quite a number of disease management contracts. They have varying components of risk and a very strong business trend, as we are slowly eliminating risk in most of these contracts. Frankly, in the one that we just drove the $21 million of revenue recognition. As we negotiated that final sign-off with the customer, we put in place an agreement going forward that has significantly less risk, which means that the revenue recognition will be less lumpy.  There are still a couple of customers where you will occasionally see a quarter where there’s some lumpiness, but, frankly, there’s nothing else out there that would be of quite the magnitude you saw this quarter. 
Glen Santangelo – Credit Suisse: Thank you for the comments. 
Operator: The next question will come from Tom Gallucci. Your line is open. State your affiliation, please. 
Tom Gallucci – Merrill Lynch: Merrill Lynch. Good evening. I guess just a couple of quick ones here. You mentioned in the prepared remarks med/surg EBIT margin, or EBIT actual dollars were down a little bit year-over-year, baked within the distribution segment at this point. Can you give us any color on the activities in that business? 
John Hammergren: I think we’ll continue to make progress in the med/surg business. You saw strength in the revenue line, which is an indication of the health of the business. At the gross margin level, the business is still extremely healthy. We did do some additional investing in this business as we were making the final execution of the implementation of the sale of that acute care business, and we’re continuing to invest in sales and marketing there to some extent as well. I think we’re very well positioned to get into the target EBIT margin ranges that we discussed a year ago, or so, in the back half of this year. But, as you know, we won’t be talking about the business in a discrete way.  I might mention that one of the reasons that it’s difficult for us to give a finite number from an operating income perspective in this business is we’re beginning to leverage the assets of our pharmaceutical distribution business. I know there have been some discussions and questions around our ability to take advantage of the opportunity in the pharmaceutical segment, directly into physician offices. Having a pharmaceutical distribution company tied with the medical/surgical alternate site company affords us a great deal of experience and understanding and a skill-base to penetrate the pharmaceutical opportunities that exist in the alternate site marketplace. So we’re well positioned for that as well.  I would say that we had some drag in the quarter reported in the distribution solution segment because of med/surg, but we’re not concerned about it, because all of the indicators are headed in the right direction. 
Tom Gallucci – Merrill Lynch: Okay, and then branded price inflation sounded like a factor in terms of the earnings in the calendar second quarter versus the third quarter at AmeriSource this morning. I think Cardinal has talked a little bit about the rate of branded price inflation in the June quarter of this year versus last year. Can you talk about what you’ve seen there and if that helps or hurts your calendar second quarter versus the third quarter that’s coming. 
John Hammergren: I’ll let Jeff talk a little bit about how this rolls into our business, but, from a philosophical perspective, I think it’s important to understand that I think we have a great deal of expertise and the management of our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers. We’ve been doing business with some of them for 100 years or more, and our team has been completely reenergized and focused around the value opportunities that exist in this customer class for us.  We think we did a great job in leading the way and establishing a new fee-for-service arrangements with these manufacturers. I think it’s also important to note that I don’t believe that all manufacturers behave the same way, or that their behavior with us is the same as a class of wholesalers all the time, or the comparisons that might go on. I think the point here is I’m not suggesting that we’re better or worse than anyone else from a performance perspective, but I do think that you’ll see occasional variability on a compare basis, or on a quarterly basis between players in this industry that may cause a little bit of noise in the channel. That’s, once again, one of the reasons why we talk about annual guidance, because we can’t forecast with certainty any of these things that happen. Jeff, you might want to provide some color as well. 
Jeff Campbell: I would just add, Tom, we’ve talked for awhile about the fact that we focused on annual guidance, because there’s a number of things that we’re very confident of over a 12 month period, but we don’t always have complete control of what happens quarter to quarter. So we try to focus people on the annual numbers.  What I would say is we were really pleased by the June quarter in our U.S. pharmaceutical business. We had very nice margin expansion and the overall results came in about exactly as we had been planning. 
Tom Gallucci – Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much. 
Operator: The next question will come from Eric Coldwell. Your line is open. State your affiliation, please. 
Eric Coldwell – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Hello, it’s Robert W. Baird. Two quick questions. My name must have been asked. First off, John, you mentioned the NHS contract and that’s coming back into visibility for profitability in fiscal ’09. Can you give us some sense on what the current dilution is and where you see that margin potential long-term on NHS? My other question is very much housekeeping. I just want to get a sense of U.S. direct sales growth if we back out the Pharmacare account acquisition. Thank you. 
John Hammergren: On the NHS contract you did hear me correctly when I said that we were making great progress in its implementation. We’ve incurred the expenses almost on a straight line, ratable basis here. Whereas the revenue by the nuances of the contract will happen near the tail of the contract, so we expect in FY ’09 we’ll begin to feel a more positive effect from it.  It was probably more break even in the quarter than any significant fuel behind our results. Although I’m pleased with the progress, I didn’t want any of you to believe that our results were driven by some new activity with NHS.  As we look into next fiscal year, we do expect it to be profitable. It may not be additive to our margin, because it has a lot of revenue, but it will certainly be additive on a year-over-year basis compared to a breakeven. But it may not get to the low to mid teens kind of margin on that specific contract. 
Eric Coldwell – Robert W. Baird & Co.: If I can jump in, John, I think at one point a couple of years ago when that was a more visible event, I think when you renegotiated, there was some commentary that potentially could get back to a 5% EBIT over time. Is that still ballpark for fiscal ’09, or could it be a little better? 
John Hammergren: I think it should be better than that. I just think it will be dilutive to the low teen kind of numbers. I hate to give you some (inaudible) 
Eric Coldwell – Robert W. Baird & Co.: And then on Pharmacare, what was direct sales growth if we back out that contract win? 
John Hammergren: We have wins and losses every quarter and I don’t think that any of the wins or losses we’ve had in any of this is really material to our numbers. That’s why we really haven’t called any out. Actually, if you look at our customer base, it’s very stable and there are very few ins and outs that happen in our market with our customers. I don’t think we even have the number, if we did, I don’t think it would make any difference really to our growth rates. The guys are nodding at me around the table, so I am assuming that’s maybe a less than half a percent or something like that. 
Eric Coldwell – Robert W. Baird & Co.: And just for clarification, you put that business in direct sales, correct? 
Jeff Campbell: Yes, that is correct. 
Eric Coldwell – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Okay, thanks guys. 
 Operator : Next question will come from Steve Unger. Your line is open, state your affiliation please. 
 Steve Unger – Bear Stearns: Hi, Bear, Stearns. Jeff, with one week less of sales in Canada in med/surge, am I correct in calculating that it equates to somewhere around $125 million to $130 million in revenue and maybe $15 million to $20 million in gross profit? 
 Jeff Campbell : The way I would look at it, I must admit, I haven’t dome the calculation exactly the way you just did. The way we think about it, if you adjust the revenues for that growth then you’ve got med-surg growth in the 10% range year-over-year. And, you’ve got Canadian growth, if you also adjust for foreign exchange year-over-year of about 6%, which we think is very healthy in the case of med-surg and around market. Yes, you can look at the gross profit contributions you would get from that and it would go straight to that line. 
 Steve Unger – Bear Stearns: For next quarter, would that be picked up? We have an extra week next quarter or no? 
 Jeff Campbell : No, this is a very head hurting subject which we could take offline, but the rest of the year you will have comparable size periods in both of those businesses in terms of costs. 
 Steve Unger – Bear Stearns: Lastly, what’s the status of OneStop generics in Canada? 
John Hammergren: Our generic business in Canada, and clearly we have one and it is robust. I would say it has got a little different form than the U.S. business does and it is certainly profitable to us, but in that environment up there, it takes on a different character than it does here. 
 Steve Unger – Bear Stearns: Okay, Great. Thanks. 
 Operator : Next question will come from George Hill. Your line is open, state your affiliation please. 
 George Hill – Leerink Swan: Leerink Swann. John, maybe you could just comment a little bit on what you are seeing in the radiology business? You guys continue to have strong results there. However, the DRA seems to be impacting a lot of your competitors and potential buyers in that market, I guess what’s separating McKesson, and could you put some numerical color about how strong the results have been? 
 John Hammergren : Yes, George. Thanks for the question. We do have great momentum in our radiology business and I think our PACS system really took off and provided significant momentum for us right after we acquired it and built out our sales presence with it. A lot of that was in the community hospital space.  What we’ve done now, you’ve heard me talking and comment about the replacement market. There were a whole bunch of folks who bought these systems three or four or five years before we launched our product and there is a significant difference in the features and benefits of the early PACS systems versus the most recent McKesson Generation PACS. So we are selling replacement products now to people that have already digitized but want to upgrade the feature function of their software and they are using McKesson to do that. That would be one reason that we are growing, is that our system has significant advantages over the systems that are available from most of our competitor’s and significant advantages for customers who are already using other McKesson products to take out non-McKesson product and install McKesson’s PAC system.  In addition, we’ve talked about our deal with Toshiba, where we are now moving downstream into the diagnostic clinic market where they are using radiology and they are using our systems in conjunction with these smaller devices that are being installed there.  The third big opportunity for us is emerging really now in the small community market. You’ve heard me talk about the product called Paragon, which has been a complete reinvention of our small hospital information systems product lines where we’re beginning to sell PACS into those smaller hospitals and that’s also providing momentum. We think we are very well positioned. We’re a leader in that marketplace, and I think that some of the comments you are hearing from people about market problems are more related to the competitiveness of their products as opposed to a lack of demand in the marketplace. 
 George Hill – Leerink Swan: Okay. Maybe just one more comment. You commented on seeing strength in the payer market. Maybe you could talk just a second about what functionality payers are looking for and what you guys have to offer them? Maybe another comment about what’s in development? 
 John Hammergren : Well, we have a great set up payer products, probably 90% of the payers in America have one of our products installed or are using one of our services. We have great leading brands there, products like InterQual and others that have been used for decades to help manage the medical claims process and to provide analytics etc. into that space. Increasingly, I think what’s a real desire is the providers and the payers have a desire to work more closely together, and what’s great about McKesson’s position is there are no other technology companies involved the way we are on both sides of the aisle, actually, in all three: the ambulatory markets, the hospital market and the payer market. Increasingly, people are turning to us for a more integrated solution and a view on where that future might be as we continue to innovate in this area. I think our existing products are selling well, obviously, disease management is a whole other service line that is selling well for us, then you put the additional benefit of a total McKesson platform connected view using Relay Health as a transaction vehicle in the middle and you’ve really got a home run opportunity. 
 Operator : Our next question will come from Larry Marsh. Your line is open, state your affiliation please. 
 Larry Marsh – Lehman Brothers: Larry Lehman. Jeff, I just want to say your comments came in loud and clear this quarter. Nice job relative to some of the technical challenges last quarter. I just want to elaborate, Jeff, and then a follow up if I could. You said one of the biggest factors that you cited at the analyst meeting that kept you from even going down the road of quarterly guidance was the timing a price increases from manufacturers. You reiterated that today, I think you said at the time there was one big that could swing earnings several cents this quarter. Sounds like that was being deferred now to the September quarter. I am curious, wouldn’t that give you some offset to some of the communicated more challenging comps you talked about on the calls for September? 
 Jeff Campbell: Well, actually, I don’t think you did hear us today talk about any deferrals that really impacted our results in a significant way. In fact, when you look at our results for the June quarter, they were right about exactly on our plan. We’re really pleased. We had nice margin expansion and so I would say that our remarks for the rest of the year stand as they are. 
 Larry Marsh – Lehman Brothers: So there was no deferral of any anticipated increases relative to your expectations? 
 Jeff Campbell: Well, you know, Larry, we track hundreds of manufacturers and we have to for those manufacturers who still use price increases as a mechanism in our annual agreements, sure, we track lots of price increases and some happen early and some happen later, but on balance our quarter came in exactly like we thought. 
 Larry Marsh – Lehman Brothers: And just an elaboration, one of the big messages this year was the reassignment of Emad’s Group in the payer business and you’re calling out one particular contract where you know there is a mismatch between the costs and revenues. I think, Jeff, your comment you said don’t expect this too often. Just to help us understand, could you elaborate a little bit on the kind of relationship that would be such a significant one that would cause this kind of swing? Over the last several years, has there been anything even close to this and would you anticipate anything even close to this in the next year or so? 
 John Hammergren : Larry, this is John. Let me take a stab at that, but before I do, let me just make sure I am being clear about the comments relative to manufacturer price increases. I am just trying to deal with the potential inconsistency that may exist and the messages you might receive from players in the industry and highlight to you that differences do exist and differences may exist over time. I don’t think anyone is trying to suggest to you that those differences mean that anybody’s performance over an annual basis is going to be materially different. All it means is that our estimates are our estimates, and our competitors estimates are their estimates. Their prior year is their prior year and our prior year is our prior year. There are all kinds of moving parts to these things and so I just don’t want people on this call to assume that somehow we did something magical that was not done by others in our industry. I am just thinking that things fall differently for different people and people have different estimates about what might happen and what the timing might be around those happenings. So, let me turn my comments now to the payer business.  We did move Emad and his team into MTS and we are working on, I think as I mentioned, go-to-market synergies around the payer software businesses and the provider software businesses. And really, the only material payer thing that happened this quarter that was moving the needle around was the contract we called out in the disease management segment. The rest of the performance was driven primarily by prior MPT performance and Per-Se performance, just to be clear.  On that individual disease management contract, you might recall on previous calls, I’ve talked about state Medicaid agencies and the big contracts we have with these big state Medicaid agencies. I don’t want to specifically talk about this customer, but clearly, the magnitude of taking on four of five disease states for several years for a state and then reconciling all of the profit from that state program in one contract reconciliation could cause an artifact like this to occur with the expenses being readily realized as we delivered the service with the payment at risk to prove that we delivered the value that we said we would deliver. This has not happened to us before anywhere near this magnitude and nor do we really think that it’s going to continue as a pattern, but we wanted to call it out and tell people about it, because we didn’t want you to not understand what was one of the driving forces in what we think is stellar performance in our technology segment this quarter.  Taking that out, you still have terrific performance and the disease management business is still a terrific business, we’re just trying to normalize it a little bit more through our new contracting methods, reducing some of the risk for us and reducing as Jeff and I talked about, the lumpiness of the recognition. It has not really happened before and I don’t think we’ll see it at this magnitude as we go forward. 
 Larry Marsh – Lehman Brothers: Okay. That’s fair enough. I guess your message too is you really are not that anxious to take on these big risk taking contract in disease management anyway, but thanks for calling that out and elaborating on it. 
 John Hammergren : You’re welcome. I think the point is that it was difficult to tell the states that we weren’t going to take the risk when we didn’t have evidence of our results. Now we have terrific evidence of our results and we no longer have to take the risk and we no longer, frankly, have to charge the premium to take the risk either. So, the contracts can be developed in a more typical business fashion, where we can recognize revenues and expenses as we go through the implementation. 
 Larry Marsh – Lehman Brothers: Great. Thank you. 
 John Hammergren : You’re welcome. 
 Operator : Our next question will come from Ricky Goldwasser. Your line is open, state your affiliation. 
 Ricky Goldwasser - UBS : UBS. Just to further follow-up on Larry’s question regarding branded price inflation, just in terms of clarification as far as impact on distribution margin. I know that you don’t comment on specific manufacturers, but looking kind of at our list, in July both Pfizer and Glaxo did raise prices. We didn’t see that last quarter, and we didn’t see it the same time last year. The question there is, now that you know this, did these increases somewhat offset or offset the impact that you are seeing on margins from the earlier comparison on Plavix and Zocor? Can we see year over year margin actually being stabilized rather than being margined down because of this additional benefit? 
Jeff Campbell : Ricky, I commend you for your focus on what’s happening in the industry. Clearly, we’re not comfortable commenting on our relationships with specific manufacturers and to John’s earlier point, what we had assumed in how the relationships work. What I would say is clearly we are off to a solid start for the year, but it is very early. We’ve left our guidance for the year as is and we continue, as I went through in my prepared remarks, to expect that the rest of the year will be particularly heavily weighted towards that March quarter. But, things will continue to evolve as the year goes on. 
 Ricky Goldwasser - UBS : So, just to clarify, when you are saying it’s going to be heavily weighted towards the March quarter, that’s based on the same assumption that you gave us when you provided guidance? 
 Jeff Campbell : Well, it’s based on everything we knew at the time and that we know today. 
 Ricky Goldwasser - UBS : Okay, and just again to clarify, I think you said earlier you don’t expect to be in target range for the full year for drug distribution? Again— 
 Jeff Campbell : No, I’m sorry. Let me be very clear. The only margin comments on segments that we’re making today are on the technology solutions segment. We have a goal that we’ve talked about for a while in the Technology Solution segment to being in the low to mid teens. Clearly, teens starts at 13 and we were right in that range this quarter. We had a 13.7% margin. We were really pleased by that and that’s where we’re going to be in the longer-term.  The only caveat I gave is when you think about the disease management contract that we just talked about a little bit, that really helped the margin in that segment this quarter. When we look at the full year, while we expect to get close, we probably won’t quite be into that low to mid teens range. 
 Ricky Goldwasser - UBS : Okay, but no comment on being, your range for the Distribution business? 
Jeff Campbell: Again, we’ve said all along that we expect to be in the 150 to 200. Last year we made great progress and got over 150 and we expect to make continued progress this year. So we’ve really made no change to that discussion.  In fact, this whole discussion around pharma distribution we made no changes to anything we’ve said to you from the beginning of the guidance that we provided for this fiscal year, other than to emphasize the next two quarters we have difficult compares compared to last year and we don’t have as many new products coming into the marketplace in the next two quarters, so we see the fourth quarter as being a very strong quarter as we come out. So I think the message in Distribution Solutions should be, “Boy, just as these guys had told us,” the message on McKesson Technology Solutions is, “Wow, what a terrific quarter” and we’re trying to give you some color around the wow so that you understand we’re very pleased with it, but also give you a little color as to what the drivers were of it so that we’re all on the same page. We’re not going to probably repeat $20 million in revenue req on DM contracts for the next three quarters.  Does that help, Ricky? 
 Ricky Goldwasser - UBS : Yes, it does. Thank you. 
John Hammergren: I think we have one more question and time for one more. 
Operator: Our last question today comes from Robert Willoughby. 
Robert Willoughby – Banc of America: I don’t know if you actually gave an organic growth rate for the Technology Solutions business. If you backed out that disease management contribution as well as Per-Se, any sense what that number was? 
Jeff Campbell: Well I think it was still very healthy and double-digit growth rates, so we’re pleased with the momentum of the core Technology Solution segment. Setting aside DM, setting aside the changing of the segments and setting aside Per-Se, the business is very healthy and performing very well and growing at we think above market levels because our solutions are being more readily accepted. 
Robert Willoughby – Banc of America: Have you made an effort to cut some of the value-added resellers on the physician software side and go more direct or is it still status quo there? 
John Hammergren: Well I think if anything we probably tried to reinforce our position with the value-added resellers, Bob. We can’t cover these 100,000 small docs out there that have these systems as fluidly as we would like. What we’ve done to augment the services of the VARS is to make sure that the McKesson sales force on the distribution side, 500+ men and women that are out there knocking on the doors, are armed with enough knowledge to get our customers interested in IT. We’ve also put together a sales support line, call center kind of service to support the sale into these customers, but we have some terrific value-added resellers that do a great job of bringing our complete product line to the marketplace from a technology perspective. And frankly, they’re a resource for McKesson and for McKesson’s other sales channel folks to make it happen. And I think the strength in our inventory business this quarter, which I highlighted, is another example of our ability to not only understand how VARS work, but train them and facilitate their use so we can grow our business. 
Robert Willoughby – Banc of America: Thank you. 
John Hammergren: I want to thank you all for the call. We’re off to a very solid start I think in Fiscal 2008. We remain very excited about our unique offerings across healthcare and our ability to turn that into value for our customers and our shareholders. I’ll now hand the call off to Larry for his review of upcoming events for the financial community. Larry. 
Larry Kurtz: Thanks, John. (Inaudible) in a conversation, I guess, is a better way to say it at the Thomas Wiesel Healthcare conference in Boston. On September 11th, we’ll present at the Bear Stearns Healthcare conference in New York City. On September 28th, we’ll be on a panel at the inaugural Goldman Sachs Pharmaceutical Supply Chain and Generic Symposium in New York City. And we plan to release our Fiscal 2008 second quarter results on October 30th, so we won’t spoil Halloween for you two years in a row.  Thank you and until we see each other at one or more of these events, goodbye and take care. 
Operator: At this time that would conclude today’s conference. You may disconnect. Thank you.
