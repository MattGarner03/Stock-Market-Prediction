===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-24 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Molina Healthcare First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeffrey Geyer. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Geyer: Good morning and welcome to Molina Healthcare's first quarter 2025 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO Joe Zubretsky, and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our first quarter 2025 earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our investor relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those of you who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that all of the remarks are made as of today, Thursday, April 24, 2025, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. On this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the first quarter 2025 earnings release. During the call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements regarding our 2025 guidance, the estimated amount of our embedded earnings power, and future earnings realization, expected Medicaid rate adjustments and updates, our projected MCR, organic Medicaid and marketplace membership growth, our recent RFP awards, our acquisitions and M&A activity, revenue growth related to RFPs and M&A activity, potential Medicaid funding cuts or program changes, and our long-term growth strategy. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10K annual report filed with the SEC, as well as our risk factors listed in our Form 10Q and Form 8K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?
Joe Zubretsky: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Today, I will discuss several topics. Our reported financial results for the first quarter. Our growth initiatives and the related increase to embedded earnings, and our full-year 2025 guidance, which we reaffirm at $42 billion of premium revenue and at least $24.50 in earnings per share. Let me start with our first quarter performance. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.08 on $10.6 billion of premium revenue supported by strong operating metrics across all lines of business. Our 89.2% consolidated MCR reflects strong medical cost management and an improving rate environment. We produced a 3.9% adjusted pre-tax margin or 3% after tax, a very strong result. In Medicaid, the business produced an MCR of 90.3% in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. As contemplated in our initial guidance, medical costs increased moderately due to continued utilization of LTSS, high-cost drugs, and behavioral health services, as well as seasonal illnesses, the impacts of which were mostly offset by updates in the new rate cycle. In Medicare, we reported a first quarter MCR of 88.3%, which was in line with our expectations. Medical cost trend was as expected and was adequately captured by rates and risk adjustment. Our strategy of leveraging our existing Medicaid footprint to serve high acuity, low-income Medicare beneficiaries is working well. In Marketplace, the first quarter MCR was 81.7% and was higher than expected. This was the result of prior year items related to final risk adjustment and membership reconciliations, as well as a higher new store MCR related to the first quarter results of our ConnectiCare acquisition. Excluding these items, the normalized MCR was approximately 77.7%, more in line with our expectations. Turning now to our growth initiatives, we continued our successful track record of winning RFPs in the quarter. In Medicaid, we successfully defended our position in Nevada, as we were awarded a contract to serve Medicaid beneficiaries in the 2 largest urban areas in the state. In our Medicare dual eligible business, we were awarded a contract in Illinois to provide a fully integrated dual eligible special needs plan. This win completes the full transition of our existing MMP members to an integrated D-SNP product in all of our MMP states for January 1, 2026. We project incremental annual premium revenue of approximately $800 million from this new contract and have added $0.50 per share to our embedded earnings. This contract win also moves us closer to achieving our premium revenue target of $46 billion in 2026 and at least $52 billion, which is the low end of our target range for 2027. With respect to M&A activity, our acquisition pipeline continues to contain many actionable opportunities as we remain opportunistic in deploying capital to accretive acquisitions. Embedded earnings have now increased from approximately $7.75 to $8.65 per share. This represents approximately one-third of our current EPS and serves to support our target future growth rate. Turning now to our 2025 guidance. Full-year 2025 premium revenue guidance remains unchanged at approximately $42 billion. We also reaffirm our full-year 2025 adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $24.50 or 8% year-over-year growth. Mark will discuss a few of the changing components within our EPS guidance, a major point of which will be that full-year 2025 Medicaid rates are projected to be slightly higher than previously expected as states reflect recent cost trends in on and off cycle rate updates. Given that known fact, we also increased our outlook for cost trend, reflecting some conservatism at this early point in the year. Our 2025 guidance is a strong foundation off of which to grow and to realize the embedded earnings power of the opportunities we have already secured. Turning now to the political and legislative landscape. In Medicaid, we continue to believe that any changes to the Medicaid program in the near term will be marginal. The general perception is that Congress and the current administration will implement Medicaid program changes through possible combinations of various funding reduction approaches in order to meet federal spending targets. There are many credible estimates of the potential impact of these various approaches. We continue to believe that any impacts to membership volume or the acuity of the risk pool will be manageable and will not disrupt the earnings trajectory of our business. You are all well aware of the complex legislative process, which will ensue over the coming months to reconcile the Senate and House resolutions to a final bill. While we await a definitive legislative framework, we continue to believe that neither side of the aisle wants to see an increase in the number of uninsured, a significant reduction in benefits for those relying on government assistance or the inevitable related impact to providers. In Medicare, we are pleased with the recent CMS final rate notice for Medicare Advantage. In addition, the early read on states promoting the integration of Medicaid and Medicare bodes well for us having a significant Medicaid footprint and a competitive D-SNP offering. Finally, in marketplace, we remain confident in the stability of our membership and the outlook for the business, despite the various program integrity initiatives and a final decision on the enhanced subsidies, which would impact marketplace enrollment in 2026. Any impacts to membership have been contemplated in current year guidance and our future year revenue outlook. States have also communicated a willingness to allow market participants to update rates for 2026 based on the final resolution of the enhanced subsidies, which would substantially mitigate any related pricing risk. Our first quarter results and reaffirmed full-year 2025 guidance reflect our team's disciplined approach to medical cost management in an improving rate environment. Our revenue growth and pre-tax margin profiles across all segments remain consistent with our long-term targets, and we continue to harvest and replenish embedded earnings. As we take an early look into 2026, we are confident in the process for actuarial soundness and the adequacy of Medicaid rates. In reviewing publicly available information, state by state, we believe that the broad Medicaid market appears to need 200 to 300 basis points of rate in excess of trend to obtain some level of program equilibrium. If rate updates were to be made at that level, recognizing that all market participants obtain the same rate, Molina should be soon return to performing at 89% or better, perhaps also while paying into the corridors. Our businesses, while not immune to external forces, have been resilient in the face of many uncertainties over the past many years. The redetermination process is behind us. Any legislative changes to the Medicaid program are likely to be marginal and healthcare is generally less sensitive to economic cycles. Our 2025 earnings and growth profiles are solid and therefore we remain very confident in our ability to achieve our 13% to 15% long-term earnings per share growth target. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark?
Mark Keim: Thanks Joe and good morning everyone. Today I'll discuss additional details on our first quarter performance, the balance sheet, and our 2025 guidance. Beginning with our first quarter results. For the quarter, we reported approximately 11 billion in total revenue and 10.6 billion of premium revenue with adjusted EPS of $6.08. Our first quarter consolidated MCR was 89.2% and reflects strong medical cost management and an improving rate environment. In Medicaid, our first quarter reported MCR was 90.3% and in the line with our expectations. As we expected, medical costs increased moderately due to the continued utilization of LTSS, high-cost drugs and behavioral health services, as well as seasonal illness. These were largely offset by the first quarter rate cycle, which came in as expected. In Medicare, our first quarter reported MCR was 88.3%, in line with our expectations. We remain confident in the pricing and benefit adjustments we implemented for 2025. The reported MCR also reflects the improvement related to our decision to exit MAPD in 13 states. In Marketplace, our first quarter reported MCR was 81.7%. The MCR was higher than expected and driven by 2 prior year items. Lower final risk adjustment and member reconciliation adjustments. Also note that the initial new store, MCR of ConnectiCare is as expected, running higher than target early on. Altogether, these 3 non-recurring items accounted for approximately 400 basis points in the quarter. Excluding these items, the normalized marketplace MCR was approximately 77.7 and reflects seasonality that was more in line with our expectations. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 6.8, driven by operating discipline and the continued benefit of operating leverage. Turning to the balance sheet. Our capital foundation remains strong. In the quarter, we harvested approximately 110 million of subsidiary dividends, and our parent company cash balance was approximately 190 million at the end of the quarter. Our operating cash flow for the first quarter was 190 million. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares at a total cost of 500 million. Debt at the end of the quarter was 2 times trailing 12-month EBITDA and our debt-to-cap ratio was about 47. We continue to have ample cash and access to capital to fuel our growth initiatives. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 46%, lower than normal. While our reserving policies remain consistent, the timing of payments can have quarter-to-quarter impact on reported reserves, as it did this quarter, as we had 1 additional claim payment cycle. We remain confident in the strength of our reserves. Next, a few comments on our 2025 guidance. As Joe mentioned, we continue to expect full year premium revenue to be approximately $42 billion. Within that number are a few moving pieces. We expect higher organic growth in our marketplace and Medicaid segments to offset the mid-year loss of our Virginia contract. Recall, we previously guided for this contract to carry through year end, but now we expect our membership to be reallocated to other MCOs mid-year. Our full-year consolidated MCR is now 88.8%. Within Medicaid, the full year MCR is unchanged at 89.9%. We are seeing rate increases slightly higher than we had previously expected as our state partners continue to update their actuarial data. These rate increases are offset by our outlook on full-year trend, which is now slightly higher and reflects our conservatism at this point in the year. Together, full-year rates and trends are both higher by 50 basis points and result in no change to the MCR guidance. Our MCR guidance on Medicare also remains unchanged at 89%. We remain confident in the performance of our Medicare duals and integrated product business. In the marketplace, we are increasing our full-year MCR guidance from 79% to 80%, which is the upper end of our long-term target range. This 100 basis point increase reflects the unfavorable non-recurring impacts in the quarter I discussed earlier. The marketplace MCR trajectory for the rest of the year is largely unchanged from our prior view. We continue to expect the segment to produce mid single digit pre-tax margins. Effectuation rates remain strong through the first quarter, and we are encouraged by early performance of new members added through the open enrollment and special enrollment periods. Our year-end outlook on membership increases by 40,000 to approximately 620,000 members and includes the estimated impact from income verifications and program integrity initiatives. We now expect the full-year G&A ratio to be approximately 6.9%, better than previously guided by 10 basis points, as we continue to drive efficiencies in our operations. We reaffirm our full-year EPS guidance of at least $24.50 per share. Within that number are a few moving pieces. Our EPS guidance now includes a $0.40 benefit from share repurchases in the first quarter; $0.30 from higher volumes in our Medicaid and marketplace segments, and $0.30 commensurate with the improved G&A ratio. These favorable items offset a $0.60 headwind attributable to the higher marketplace MCR guidance and $0.40 loss from the mid-year termination of our Virginia contract. We continue to expect earnings to be evenly distributed throughout the year. Turning to embedded earnings. Our new store embedded earnings are now approximately $8.65 per share, up $0.90 from our prior outlook of $7.75. This increase includes $0.50 from the recent duals contract win in Illinois and an additional $0.40 as we are now recognizing half of the Virginia contract loss in current year guidance rather than next year as previously expected. We expect one-third of this new store embedded earnings to emerge in 2026, giving us high confidence in our 13% to 15% long-term growth rate. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Stephen Baxter: Hey, good morning, just wanted to start on the exchanges. I was hoping first, if you could expand what you saw on risk adjustment and also this member reconciliation dynamic, I guess specifically with member reconciliation, what exactly are you describing there and trying to understand better, why we should think about that as a non-recurring item and then just thinking about the rest of the year guidance on the [indiscernible] exchanges, obviously you called out and kind of 400 basis points of variance in the first quarter you're taking up the full year, I think by now 100 basis points. So, rest of the year feels like it's relatively on impact and just trying to understand kind of the continuing elements of what you saw in the first quarter and how much of that we need to think about continuing for the rest of the year. Thank you.
Joe Zubretsky: Stephen, the marketplace story is a very positive one. We did have non-recurring items in the first quarter, which elevated the MCR by 400 basis points. I'll kick it to Mark in a minute for more detail. Membership reconciliations, members that were not authorized to be in the plan, but we were servicing last year because they were -- they were on the membership roles. That was a scrub by CMS to eliminate members who lacked authorization, a one-time item. The other one-time item was a true-up to 2024 risk adjustment. The final piece, as typical for an acquisition, the MCR will be operating at the inherited MCR, which for ConnectiCare is in the mid to high 80s. We're still confident in bringing that down to our target to produce the full $1 of earnings accretion that resides in our embedded earnings. The marketplace story is very positive. We're going to end the year with 620,000 members, mid single digit margins, and still operating. Within our long-term range, albeit an increase from our previous guidance of 79%, now to 80%. Mark, anything to add?
Mark Keim: Yeah Joe, I think you got it. Let me just break that down a little further. The 400 basis points is about 40 million, and that breaks down pretty much a third, a third, a third on the things that Joe talked about. I'll add a little color to them. On the final prior year risk adjustment, I'm sure you're aware in marketplace, risk adjustment is on a relative basis, not an absolute basis like Medicare. So, it's right about now that we find relative to the other players exactly how we scored last year, and we were just a little bit less than we thought on risk adjustment when the final numbers came in. These are the weeklies. So that's a non-recurring, normal function of how we settle up risk adjustment. On member reconciliation, this is not FTR. This is members that were on the books last year that when they get their tax filings realized they had a policy and didn't know it. Sometimes that's administration issues, sometimes it's broker issues, but right about now is when we see those, because that's when the tax filings come due, we're pretty confident in that number, and that's a pretty final number for last year; you know, the good news is with all the integrity stuff going on, you're going to see a lot less of that going forward. And then lastly, as Joe mentioned on the new store impact of ConnectiCare that ran in the high 80s initially. We'll pull that down quick with the Molina playbook, but there's a little bit of noise in there that certainly pulls our reported MCR up. Roll those together, that's the 400 [indiscernible] we talked about.
Operator: And the next question comes from Andrew Mok with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Andrew Mok: Hi, good morning. In the prepared remarks, you called out higher assumptions for both rates and cost trends. Cost trend, it sounds like the rates is, on the Medicaid side sounds like the cost trend is on the ACA side. Do I have that right? And what exactly are you seeing on each of those items that is informing that updated assumption? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Andrew, I'll give you a high level answer, then kick it to Mark. [indiscernible] clear on what we forecasted for the Medicaid business. We received rate updates in the first quarter, $150 million, which equates to 50 basis points on a full year basis. Those will nearly entirely impact Q2, Q3, and Q4 and did not have an impact in Q1. So, states are obviously recognizing certain cost pressures and updating rates both on-cycle and off-cycle to -- to compensate for it. The only reason we increased our trend estimate for the year is at this early stage in the year reflecting appropriate conservatism, we were not going to improve our Medicaid MCR by 50 basis points at this early stage. So, rather than let those rate increases drop through to our guidance, we offset them with a top side adjustment, if you want to call it, to medical cost trend until we see more in the second quarter. So, still holding serve on our 89.9% MCR estimate in Medicaid for the year, but the rates are moving in the right direction. Mark, anything to add?
Mark Keim: That's exactly right, Joe. So, on a full year basis, Medicaid guidance unchanged at 89.9%. The only thing that's different is our rate assumption is now 5% versus [indiscernible] for the full year, and our trend assumption is 5% versus 4.5% for the full year. And again, this is all a function of the known rates we've received going forward.
Andrew Mok: Got it. Okay, so it sounds like your forward expectations on forward rates has remained unchanged, is that right?
Mark Keim: No, our forward rates are slightly better, so we're raising our full-year guidance from 4.5% to 5%.
Andrew Mok: Right, but that's the rates you've already received and have visibility into. So are the forward rate expectations also higher? The ones that haven't been finalized.
Joe Zubretsky: We know rates on 85% of our -- when we gave initial guidance, we knew about rates on about 75% of our revenue. That's now 85%. So yes, there is an estimate in for -- September and October rate adjustments that we still have them at a very modest level. So, the 5% annual rate increase includes 85% known rates for the year.
Andrew Mok: Got it. Understood. And you called out seasonal illness in Medicaid, which sounds like flu. Can you tell us the impact that that had on the quarter? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Yeah, we've sort of moved to the ILI definition that a lot of people have, which is largely flu at this point. We've not really given a normalized number, but I think the more helpful thing for you is we probably ran 10 million to 15 million hot versus what we might call normal. But again, we had that in our guidance, so that really wasn't a surprise to us.
Operator: And your next question will be from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Josh Raskin: Hi, thanks. I just want to ask on the exchanges, so just taking a step back, can you help us understand where the marketplace fits in your long-term strategies? I know you went through this with the Investor Day, but are there synergies or other, with the other 2 segments or value that comes beyond the gross margin contribution? And I understand medical margin dollars were actually up 20% in 1Q, but is there a desire to sort of bid to think differently about the annual volatility in that book at some point?
Joe Zubretsky: Josh, as we said in Investor Day, the product line is completely synergistic with our pure play, government sponsored managed care theme to our strategy as people income up and down from Medicaid into Medicaid expansion into highly subsidized marketplace, people are moving in and out of life circumstances often frequently, and having a product where we can capture the member for their lifetime or as long as they're in government assistance across a broad range of products is totally synergistic. In fact, when they turn 65, which 50,000 members of ours due every single year, we have a D-SNP offering that captures the agents. So very, very synergistic and attractive contributor to the profile of the business. We were earning nearly double digit pre-tax margins in the last 2 prior years. We consciously invested that excess margin in membership growth, while still targeting mid single digit pre-tax margins. We will grow the business at a rate that allows us to hit mid single digit pre-tax margins for the reason you articulated that it can be volatile when you bring on new membership, not knowing their cost profile and not having the benefit of risk adjustment means there is a cost to growth, and we want to manage that volatility. Mark, anything to add?
Mark Keim: No, I think that's well summarized Joe, you've sometimes referred to it as a residual market, because when other things in the economy go up and down, it sort of captures the excess. Therefore, there is more volatility, Josh, and what we've always been very clear about is it's a relatively small part of our portfolio. We will price for margin and let the volume fall where it does.
Operator: And your next question will come from A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.
A.J. Rice: Hi everybody. Thanks for the question. When you step back, you mentioned a nod to the Washington backdrop of all this chatter about Medicaid cuts adjustments, whatever. I wonder, is that -- are you seeing that in any way impact the discussions with states around rate updates or RFP processes or is what's going on in Washington and any uncertainty that creates having any impact on any of that.
Joe Zubretsky: No, A.J., I would say not. The rate discussions are pure, actuary to actuary looking at the actuarial data, and the real positive news about rates is the cost pressure are coming from cost categories that are very discrete and prominent in the rate models. LTSS rated separately, behavioral usually viewed separately, as well as high-cost drugs including GLP-1s. So, the cost pressures that the industry is experiencing are very highly profiled in the rate development environment. That is, it's a debate about cost trends, it's a debate about what's a credible baseline and a trend off that baseline purely has nothing to do with the -- the Washington debate about how far to pull back Medicaid. Same thing with the RFP cycle. The RFP cycle right now is actually at a low point. It was at a high point in the last 2 years where we did really, really well as advertised. It is $50 billion from 2025 to 2028 in total contract value. We have our eyes on a couple of very attractive opportunities, and the re-procurement cycle is actually at a low point as well, where we don't have a lot of re-procurements coming up in the next 24 months. But no, the dialogue in Washington is not causing any state to really rethink either the rate development process or when they re-procure their program.
Operator: And your next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Justin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Question on effectuation rates, Joe, can you remind us what you're seeing there and then can you give us a ballpark on what the MLR looks like for those members versus the overall book?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, I'll give you a high level answer and then hand it to Mark, but we've had a very successful open enrollment period in Marketplace, a very successful special enrollment period early on where we're sitting here with 660,000 members having ended last year at [400] [ph]. Our effectuation rates seem to be better or higher than many of our competitors for a variety of reasons. Mark, do you want to elaborate?
Mark Keim: Yeah, good morning, Justin. We are actually seeing pretty good effectuation rates, and you might be comparing that to what others have said in the market, and I can't really talk to their results, but I think we mentioned last time around we're either number 1 or number 2 in about 50% of our footprint. And part of effectuation is people rolling into the new cycle and seeing that their payments are maybe different than they were last year, which is a function of pricing. So, some of the folks that might be losing might be at different points on the pricing scale, and I think people through effectuation are staying with Molina or in the case of SEP coming to Molina. So, we're seeing good results on both SEP and effectuation. Now on the MLR, it's really too soon this early in the year to get a handle on that because 50% of the book is new, which is not an unusual phenomenon, but we'll have to see how that develops. And if you ask that question in the second quarter, I'll be able to give you a pretty specific view.
Operator: And your next question comes from John Stansel with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
John Stansel: Great, thanks for taking my question. Last quarter you spoke to G&A being a little bit more front-loaded as you take on the IT costs for the $1 implementation cost in 2025. I think G&A came in nicely in the quarter, I guess. How are we thinking about progression for G&A this year and how we get to kind of 10 basis points lower than your initial expectation.
Joe Zubretsky: John, the G&A story is a very positive one for us. We focus on it with the same discipline and rigor that we focus on every dollar of medical costs. We've broken through the 7.0% barrier. We've broken through that, and I'm going to talk on a mixed equivalent basis because obviously mixed matters to the G&A ratio, but on a mixed equivalent basis we're comfortably in the high 6s. We think over time as we grow to the $55 billion of 2027 revenue target with our discipline or fixed cost leverage, we can move that down on a mixed equivalent basis into the mid 6s, perhaps even the low 6s. It's a very positive part of the story that's either going to improve margins over time in our investment thesis or serve to act as a hedge to any MCR pressure we might see over the long term. Mark, on the short term?
Mark Keim: Yeah, John, if you look at the model for the rest of the year, expect a pretty flat G&A trajectory across the year. We had a 6.8% in the first quarter. We'll have a 6.9% in our guidance, which implies pretty flat across the full year. What's maybe driving that we talked about more of the implementation costs up-front in the year, and that's true. It's a little more front-end loaded, but the back-end loaded part is always some of the marketing costs around the OEP within Medicare and marketplace that usually drive up G&A. So, you've got some different things going on, but I think a pretty flat G&A story through the year.
Operator: And your next question comes from Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Sarah James: Thank you. One clarification and then a HIX question. So just to clarify, when you moved up the Medicaid cost trend 50 basis points, was that pure conservatism or did you see trend data above your prior expectations? And then on exchanges, do you think that the pricing and benefit design changes or the new member mix could change your MLR seasonality on the HIX business?
Joe Zubretsky: Sarah, you heard my prepared remarks correctly. In the Medicaid business, we absolutely received rate updates of $150 million, which caused us to increase our full-year rate update from previous guidance of 4.5% to 5%. As I said, in our member month mix 85% of rates on our member months are known at this point in time, only 15% is an estimate, those rate updates will impact quarters 2, 3, and 4. Having known that, we then said, do we let that drop through to our guidance and drop our MCR guidance by 50 basis points, at this early stage and in this environment we decided not to. We saw no empirical evidence in the first quarter, which caused us to increase trend, the increase in trend from 4.5 to 5 to be commensurate with rates was entirely due to early in the year conservatism. We'd like to see how the second quarter experience emerges before making a final call on updating the Medicaid MCR for the full year. Your second question on HIX, can you repeat it, please? Do you have it Mark?
Mark Keim: I'll take that one. Hey Sarah, on the full-year trajectory of Marketplace MLR, we're a little flatter than normal this year or at least in prior years. First of all, we've got more new membership in SEP this year, so we're a little more conservative in our initial picks. But the other thing is, you'll see ConnectiCare improving through the year as new stores typically do. And then lastly, we've got a lower bronze mix this year and bronze tends to be a much more seasonal product, so a little bit flatter on the trajectory if you're modeling it.
Operator: And your next question will come from Joanna Gajuk with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Joanna Gajuk: Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. So if I may, given the discussions around trend by product, I don't think I heard you talk about, MA. I know you said that in the quarter sounds like MLR was in line with expectations. So, can you talk about anything that's maybe happening in your Medicare Advantage book and are you still expecting same trend for the year? I think you had said on the last quarter, an increase of 2.7% for the year. Thank you.
Mark Keim: Yeah, I'll take that one. So far, Medicare playing out much like we expected. We had guided to an 89% and we're still quite confident in an 89%. You're right in remembering the build trend was about 2.7% in our original number, and rates were just a little bit less than that. So far, I'm seeing utilization [indiscernible], all of those matters, as well as the Part D under the IRA, all of those matters pretty much coming in as we anticipated. And remember, that's a much smaller part of our book.
Operator: And your next question will come from Ryan Langston with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Ryan Langston: Thanks. I want to go back to A.J.'s question. I guess on M&A with sort of the backdrop uncertainty, reconciliation, enhanced subsidies, etc. I guess is that impacting the willingness of potential M&A targets to engage on a potential deal, or is it having any impact on the potential multiples just given we don't know where everything's going to shake out? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: On the M&A front, the pipeline is still replete with opportunities. Obviously the last one we announced was the ConnectiCare acquisition, but the pipeline is full. Our M&A team is actively engaged in analyzing core products, core markets, and attractive prices if the businesses are underperforming and in this environment, as you know, performance is a challenge in this environment. Some of these smaller single state single geography companies are struggling. So no, I would say that it's not casting a pall over the M&A activity. In fact, it might even be increasing some of the flow as some of these single state operators have seen how difficult it is to run a business. We have the benefit of 22 state diversification. Single state, single geography companies don't, so I would say it's almost quite the opposite. The pipeline is full of opportunities, and we hope to fulfill the commitment we've made that one-third of our forward growth rate as we said at Investor Day, is likely coming from M&A, bearing in mind that we're already at our $52 billion estimate for 2027, which is the low end of our range. We've got 18 to 24 months to fill that other $3 billion and while nothing's a lay up in this business, highly confident we're going to do it.
Operator: And your next question will come from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Lance Wilkes: Great, thanks. Can you talk a little bit about network contracting, interested in how supplemental payments have been impacting hospitals and whether that's impacted kind of the growth and access with hospitals in your network and then also, what are you seeing as far as and what are you doing in the form of value-based care contracting? Do you see any subcomponents of that? Do you feel you're going to need to owner partner? And maybe as you're doing that, if you can just kind of clarify and utilization, if there are any unusual puts and takes between categories of like hospital, behavioral, drugs, etc. Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Lance, let me take the second part of your question first on value-based care and value-based contracting. As you know, in the past 5 years, most of the activity on VBC has been aimed at Medicare Advantage. That's where the lives are. That's where the premium was, and that's where a lot of the activity, it is coming to Medicaid. It is coming to Medicaid more slowly. There are regulatory definitions of how much of your medical cost needs to go through a VBC arrangement. We are fully compliant with the minimum requirements. Now, it's about can you manage your cost structure and risk adjustment based on your relationships. We're getting there. We have our national networking unit has a VBC arm. They are actively engaged in working with our major provider partners where we have membership density to work on value-based care arrangements, Again, over the next 2 or 3 years we will increase our penetration. Right now we are fully compliant with the regulatory rules. On your other question about supplemental payments, let me kick it to Mark and let him take that one.
Mark Keim: Right. What you're calling supplemental payments, I think we call directed payments, and they're certainly a very big part of the formula. They're getting a little bit more attention it seems these days, but that business is usual for us. We don't run them for the most part through the P&L, so they're not an aberration in our economics. We sometimes refer to them as pass-throughs, because they come from us, from the government, and go right to providers, and they're targeted for situations where providers need enhanced funding.
Joe Zubretsky: And the policy question you're getting to with that question has to do with one of the situations that we've profiled. When you're talking about cuts to the Medicaid budget, you're really talking about enrollment reductions, benefit reductions, or payments to providers, and this is one source of payment to providers, and a provider would tell you that they're not supplemental, meaning they're enhancing their margins. They're helping them make their margins. So, this is a big policy question in terms of whether the providers can bear Medicaid-related cuts of any type, either in the fee schedule or supplemental payments. I don't have a point of view on that, but that is a much of a raging debate in the policy discussions.
Operator: And your next question will come from Michael Ha with Baird. Please go ahead.
Michael Ha: Alright, thank you. On the exchange MLR pressure, I understand you're confident into next year these issues are non-recurring, but as you continue to press the gas pedal and exchange growth and thinking about risk adjustment specifically, have you implemented any new internal work streams to sort of help bolster this process for this year? And yeah, what gives you confidence on that? And then Joe, I believe you mentioned the early read on MA Medicaid integration is boding well so far. Are you hearing or I guess seeing anything new from states that gives you this incremental confidence, any early behavior change from states at all about how they might approach future Medicaid RFPs? And just for context, I've heard some speculation that, states might even open up Medicaid RFPs to include more plans because of this. So, just curious to hear what you're seeing or hearing that gives you more confidence. Thank you.
Joe Zubretsky: Well, we've heard some of those same things, but here are the facts as we know them sitting here today. Three very large states in the MMP program, which is really the only true integration program that existed, Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan. We just ran the table, very, very complex RFP submissions, intensity around true integration, one membership card, one phone number, one set of integrated benefits. You can't run one side off your Medicare platform and the other side off your Medicaid platform. And we're investing heavily, and making sure that we're able to handle those populations. The discussion around exclusively aligned enrollment is there. Whether most of the states settled there or not and allow D-SNP only plans in, we'll see. But the early discussions bode well for a company that has a very broad and deep Medicaid footprint like Molina and also has a competitive D-SNP offering. We're situated quite well and yes, we've heard the chatter that you're referencing about allowing more plans in. We'll see. We continue to believe that our integrated offering will be highly competitive. Our broker relationships are great, and the platform being truly integrated from a clinical and operational perspective is key, and we're well on our way to being there. Mark?
Mark Keim: On the marketplace question Michael, just so we're sending the right message, it's not growth for the sake of growth in marketplace, as I said earlier, marketplace is given a little bit of volatility in the space is first on margin and the volume will fall where it does. So, we've enjoyed a nice run of growth here, but that's because we believe the market has allowed that given what's going on as we move forward, if the cycle changes, we won't necessarily grow in a meaningful way. Separately, as you well know, the subsidies are potentially a headwind in the new year. So again, we'll price for margin and the volume's going to fall where it does.
Operator: And your next question will come from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
George Hill: Yeah, good morning, Joe. I have kind of a big picture question, and if I heard your comments, right, you said that like state Medicaid needs 200 to 300 basis points in advance of trend. I imagine you guys are seeing mid to high single digit trend like everybody else. So that's basically telling the states that you need a high single digit or better rate increase. Like what's the conversation at the macro level given that 45 or 50 states are in a budget deficit situation, and I imagine they can't look around, but the answer is, Medicaid costs are going to be up 8.5% or 9% in the next couple of years. Like, what is the ask of the plans as it relates to keeping a cap on costs and like, I'm interested in like the state perspective. I understand all the actuarial sound and stuff, but like the states just can't afford high single digit spending increases in Medicaid. I'd kind of love to hear the big picture of conversations that you guys are having at the state level.
Joe Zubretsky: Yeah, certainly the strength of state budgets is a concern, but we've actually analyzed this over very long periods of time. There is very little correlation between the strength of rates and whether a state is deep red, deep blue, or purple. There is very little correlation between the strength of rates and whether there's a rainy day fund or not, or whether the budget is running a surplus or a deficit. Those are just the facts. Agreed that the more stressed the state budget becomes, logic would tell you that the rate conversation might be more difficult, not from an actuarial soundness perspective, but from an affordability perspective. We are confident that based on our analysis, the broad market, and as you know, the market sets the rate with its cost structure. We appear to be operating 200 to 300 basis -- even though we're 100 basis points off the top end of our long term range, we appear to be operating 200 to 300 basis points better than the broad market. The broad market needs that to come back to some semblance of program equilibrium. When that occurs and we're confident it will, we should be comfortably back at 89% or better and paying into the corridors once again. So yes, should that be kind of a big picture of concern? Absolutely. But history has shown us that the actuarial soundness concept works, particularly over the intermediate term, not necessarily in any one quarter, but it works over time and we're confident that the market will get what it needs and therefore would be comfortably back into our long term range at 89% or better here in the foreseeable future.
Operator: And the next question will come from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Dave Windley: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask another one on exchange. On the member reconciliations, if I understand Mark what you described, these are essentially the people that were unknowingly enrolled in a product, so several questions, sorry for this, but several questions, were the – so these are 100% subsidized people, were the subsidies clawed back to the beginning of their enrollment. Second, how -- you mentioned you think this is over. How comprehensive was CMS's review of this such that we should think that this wouldn't bleed over into 2025. And then as these low risk people, low utilizer people are coming out of the pool, how does this thing -- how does this make you think about your risk adjustment assumptions for 2025? Thank you.
Mark Keim: Great. Dave, thanks for all that. So, as you described it, that's largely the case. In some cases, there is broker fraud, and in some cases it's just people signing up for things and not being aware they did it. The way they find out about it generally is in their 2024 tax filing, they hear from the government that they made too much money to qualify for whatever subsidies they got. Therefore, they owe the government back some money. They say, “Well, gee, I never signed up for that product.” We look and there were no claims, so they didn't use the product. So, the government will claw back the subsidized premiums that they gave us. So, those are revenue headwinds. Now to size that, I told you there was about [indiscernible] $40 million of adjustment in marketplace from prior year, one-third of that is this phenomenon we're talking about. Now, we're pretty much at the end of the tax season. Could we see a little bit more? Sure, but it would be a fraction of what we saw in the first quarter, which is becoming de minimis. Now on a go forward basis, you might recall that the integrity rules increased quite a bit for OEP just a few months ago. And one of the biggest things was the agent of record lock, which made it a whole lot harder for brokers to switch people, and actually made the market a lot more sticky. You didn't see the churn that you normally see. So, will these kind of situations go away 100%? Of course not. But do the new integrity rules go a long way to stop churn and maybe some fraudulent activity? I think so. So, we really consider this a one time, and I think it's largely behind us.
Joe Zubretsky: And to be very clear, when we receive a membership file that has a member on it, we have no reason to believe they're either not authorized or authorized. We have to service them as informed by CMS.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and today's conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-06 08:00:00) =====
Jeffrey Geyer: Good day, and welcome to the Molina Healthcare Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Should you need assistance, please note this event is being recorded. Now I'll turn the conference over to your host today, Jeffrey Geyer. Please go ahead. Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare's fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky, and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our investor relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for thirty days. Numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those of you who listen to the rebroadcast, we remind you that all of the remarks are made as of today, Thursday, February 6, 2025, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. On this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings release. During the call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our 2025 guidance, the estimated amount of our embedded earnings power and future earnings realization, expected Medicaid rate adjustments and updates, our projected NCR, our recent RCIA warrants, our acquisitions and M&A activity, revenue growth related to RFPs and M&A activity.
Joe Zubretsky: and our long-term growth strategy. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report filed with the SEC, as well as our risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?
Jeffrey Geyer: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Today, I will discuss several topics.
Joe Zubretsky: Our reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024, our growth initiatives, and related increases to embedded earnings and our full year 2025 premium revenue and earnings guidance. Let me start with our fourth quarter performance. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.05 on $10 billion of premium revenue. Our fourth quarter results and performance metrics did not meet our expectations, but we did demonstrate a continued ability to maintain operating discipline while navigating industry-wide headwinds. Our 90.2% consolidated NCR was higher than expected due to medical cost pressure in our Medicaid and Medicare segments. In Medicaid, our fourth quarter 2024 guidance assumes a moderate increase in trend of an elevated cost baseline from the third quarter. However, the medical cost pressure experienced in the fourth quarter was higher than anticipated, with risk corridors providing no material benefit. Medicare continued to experience higher medical costs consistent with prior quarters, and Marketplace performed very well despite the late-in-year medical cost seasonality we typically experience. For the full year 2024, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $22.65, representing 8.5% year-over-year growth.
Jeffrey Geyer: Our full year premium revenue of $38.6 billion
Joe Zubretsky: represents 19% year-over-year growth, and our pretax margin of 4.3% was well within our long-term target range. While our fourth quarter performance resulted in our full year results falling below our guidance, we have a solid earnings jump-off point heading into 2025 and continue to be very bullish on the growth opportunities within all of our businesses, as evidenced by our increased embedded earnings. In Medicaid, our flagship business representing nearly 80% of revenue, we reported a 90.3% NCR for the full year, or 89.8% when adjusting for the impact of higher MCRs on new stores and the prior year California retro item. With respect to observed medical cost trend in 2024, it was certainly a tale of two halves. In the first half of the year, medical costs trended slightly higher than our initial expectations, primarily due to the acuity shift caused by redeterminations. However, MCRs remained lower in the first half of the year because the acuity shift impact was moderated by our medical cost management, risk corridor protection,
Jeffrey Geyer: and rate increases.
Joe Zubretsky: In the second half of the year, we experienced higher than expected utilization among the continuing population.
Jeffrey Geyer: The second half rate increases
Joe Zubretsky: and risk corridors were not sufficient to completely offset the higher medical cost pressure that continued into the fourth quarter. In Medicare, the full year MCR was 89.1%. The business performed as well as we could have expected, given some of the dynamics the industry has experienced. In Marketplace, the MCR was 75.4% for the full year and significantly outperformed our long-term target range. This was the second consecutive year Marketplace outperformed its long-term target margins. This outperformance allowed us to reinvest excess margin into 2025 pricing to drive higher growth and sustain mid-single-digit pretax margins. Our G&A ratio performance has been excellent at 6.7% for the full year. We continue to have the discipline to harvest fixed cost leverage, manage our internal resources effectively, increase productivity, and negotiate attractive vendor contracts. Turning now to our growth initiatives, 2024 was an extraordinary year for securing future growth on top of the reported 19% premium revenue growth, starting with recent acquisitions. On February 1st, we closed our acquisition of Connecticut from EmblemHealth. In this year, we expect $1.2 billion of revenue, mostly in Marketplace. With respect to new contract wins, in Georgia, the state announced its intent to award it to Medicaid managed care services contract. This was a significant win with an estimated $2 billion in annual premium revenue based on expected market share. We also have significant new contract win
Jeffrey Geyer: We
Joe Zubretsky: We successfully procured dual contracts that will expand our footprint in Ohio, Michigan, Massachusetts, and Idaho.
Jeffrey Geyer: The incremental revenue from these new contracts
Joe Zubretsky: is over $3 billion, an increase from the prior estimate of $1.8 billion we had shared at our November Investor Day. 2024 was also a year in which we successfully defended RFPs in key states. We retained traditional Medicaid contracts in our Michigan, Florida, and Wisconsin businesses. These contracts represent over $2 billion of renewed premium revenue. While we are disappointed in the Virginia contract loss, this award is under protest, and the current contract will extend well into 2025. We are very pleased with the execution of our 2024, and in that context, we further note when all of the aforementioned contracts are in force, we are well on our way to meeting our target of $46 billion premium revenue in 2026, and at least $52 billion in 2027. With our current footprint contributing its average annual growth,
Jeffrey Geyer: and now fully considering
Joe Zubretsky: all of our recent growth successes, the path to achieve these growth milestones is very clear. And most importantly, all of this recent activity has allowed us to increase our embedded earnings to $7.75 for 2026 and beyond, after harvesting $1.50 of embedded earnings in our 2025 guidance.
Jeffrey Geyer: Having embedded earnings of at least 20 to 25%
Joe Zubretsky: of run rate EPS is an attractive benchmark to support future EPS growth. Now at approximately 30%, we are very well positioned to meet our long-term targets. In short, we are solidly on track to achieve the growth outlook we projected at our recent investor day. Turning now to our 2025 guidance. We project 2025 premium revenue of approximately $42 billion and adjusted earnings per share of at least $24.50, which is approximately 8% year-over-year growth. Highlighted by an 88.7% consolidated NCR and a 4.1% pre-tax margin. Similar to the situation we accounted in 2023, this $24.50 EPS guidance is burdened with $1 of contract implementation costs related to yet another significant future revenue growth cycle we secured this year. These are complex programs, with a new contract in Georgia, and fully integrated dual product launches in at least four states. These are not speculative investments, but investments that have near-term
Jeffrey Geyer: and certain realizable value.
Joe Zubretsky: Mark will take through the detailed earnings guidance build in a few minutes. But let me offer some high-level segment commentary. First in Medicaid, Medicaid is projected to be nearly back to performing within our target ranges with an 89.9% MCR. For 2025, we project a continuing elevated medical cost trend during the year. Our 2025 Medicaid rates, most of which are known, are expected to be sufficient to capture this elevated trend. Whichever 2024 MCR you observe, Q4 at 90.2, second half at 89.9, full year at 89.8, or our 2025 guidance at 89.9, our flagship business is hovering around the 90% mark, nearly 100 basis points off our long-term NCR target. The business is expected to produce an excellent pretax margin of 4.3%. When the broader market receives the rates, it needs to bring itself back into balance, we expect to be operating well within our long-term ranges, and we believe that will be in the very near future. Next in Medicare, I would characterize 2025 as a year of transition and some early growing pains,
Jeffrey Geyer: as the business transforms to serve
Joe Zubretsky: the increasingly integrated and high-growth dual eligible population. We expect our 2025 utilization pressure from the second half of 2024 is expected to continue into 2025. Second, recent rates have not kept pace with trend. And finally, while our long-term outlook for Bright's earnings accretion is unchanged, we expect that it will be slightly below breakeven in 2025. Finally, in Marketplace, we are projecting to grow premium at 60% in total, half of which is organic. Two consecutive years of exceeding target margins have allowed us to reinvest several hundred basis points of excess margin into pricing in order to grow.
Jeffrey Geyer: Our product is competitively positioned for this year
Joe Zubretsky: and we are very pleased with our early enrollment results. We expect the business to produce an MCR in the middle of our target range and a solid pre-tax margin of 6% in 2025 while continuing to sustain mid-single-digit pretax margins over the long term. Our businesses are positioned to produce an earnings per share outlook of $25.50 in 2025. This is a meaningful measure of underlying performance
Jeffrey Geyer: and represents 13% growth
Joe Zubretsky: on full year 2024 results. When we include the new contract implementation costs of $1, our adjusted EPS guidance for 2025 is at least $24.50 per share. This is a solid foundation off of which to grow and realize the embedded earnings power of the opportunities we have already secured. Turning now to the political and legislative landscape, the facts are Republicans control Congress with a very narrow majority, and have a White House. Two budget reconciliation bills are likely to be passed in 2025. And political parties in the state legislatures and the governor's offices did not change materially in the last cycle, the states will weigh in heavily on any policy changes.
Jeffrey Geyer: The question, and it is a question, that has been posed
Joe Zubretsky: and remains is whether cuts to Medicaid funding will be part of these legislative packages.
Jeffrey Geyer: We continue to believe that any changes to the Medicaid program as we know
Joe Zubretsky: be marginal. Neither side of the aisle wants to see an increase in the number of uninsured,
Jeffrey Geyer: a reduction in benefits for those relying on government assistance,
Joe Zubretsky: or the related impact to providers. While our fourth quarter results fell short of our expectations, I am pleased with our team's ability to manage through the many industry-wide headwinds in all of 2024. Our revenue growth has exceeded our long-term targets,
Jeffrey Geyer: We have produced a consolidated pre-tax margin
Joe Zubretsky: within our long-term target range
Jeffrey Geyer: and
Joe Zubretsky: embedded earnings has reached a new high. The 2025 earnings profile is solid and perhaps industry-leading in managed Medicaid.
Jeffrey Geyer: All of this allows us to remain very confident
Joe Zubretsky: in our ability to achieve the long-term targets that we shared with you at our November Investor Day.
Jeffrey Geyer: Finally, I want to thank our eighteen thousand
Joe Zubretsky: five hundred dedicated associates who work tirelessly on behalf of our members and our stakeholders. Their day-to-day efforts, particularly in the face of difficulty, danger, and natural disasters, are in a word, heroic. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark?
Jeffrey Geyer: Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss some additional details on our fourth quarter and the full year performance, the balance sheet, and our 2025 guidance. Beginning with our fourth quarter and full year 2024 results, we reported approximately $10.5 billion in total revenue and $10 billion of premium revenue, with adjusted EPS of $5.05. On a consolidated basis, our fourth quarter MCR was 90.2, and our full year MCR was 89.1, reflecting higher than expected medical costs in the second half of the year in both Medicaid and Medicare. In Medicaid, our fourth quarter MCR was 90.2. Consistent with the third quarter, the Medicaid MCR reflected higher utilization, particularly for LTSS,
Joe Zubretsky: pharmacy,
Jeffrey Geyer: and behavioral health services. We previously expected 50 basis points of trend in the fourth quarter of what we considered to be an inflated baseline in the third quarter.
Joe Zubretsky: However, fourth quarter net
Jeffrey Geyer: trend was approximately 1.2%, and we saw no material benefit from risk corridors. For the full year, the reported Medicaid MCR was 90.3, which restates to 89.8 when adjusting for the prior year California retro item and the impact of new store businesses. Given the unprecedented challenges of rates and trends in the year, we demonstrated strong operating performance with that MCR just 80 basis points above our long-term range. In Medicare, our fourth quarter MCR was 93.8, and our full year MCR was 89.1, both above our long-term range. Higher medical costs in the quarter reflected continued higher utilization of LTSS in pharmacy, as well as higher outpatient utilization within our DStent population. The fourth quarter also reflects the seasonal impact of CMS annual facility fee schedule increases and the revenue recognition of certain risk adjustment items. As Joe mentioned, we remain confident in our 2025 bids and believe our pricing strategy was conservative enough to protect against higher medical cost trend that occurred in the second half of 2024 and is expected to continue in 2025. In Marketplace, our fourth quarter MCR was 83.3, reflecting normal late-in-year seasonality. Our full year Marketplace MCR was 75.4 and well below our long-term target range for the second consecutive year. This allowed us to reinvest excess margin into pricing to achieve significant growth for 2025. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 6.3, and our full year adjusted G&A ratio was 6.7. This was the second consecutive quarter we benefited from renegotiated vendor contracts and several one-time items. We're very pleased with the disciplined cost management productivity and leverage we continue to demonstrate. Turning to the balance sheet, our capital foundation remains strong. In the quarter, we harvested approximately $327 million of subsidiary dividends. Our parent company cash balance was approximately $445 million at the end of the quarter, a portion of which was used to fund the Connecticut acquisition, which just closed earlier this week. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares at a total cost of $500 million. In November, we closed a bond offering of $750 million of senior notes due in 2033. Debt at the end of the quarter was 1.7 times trailing twelve-month EBITDA, with our debt-to-cap ratio at about 41%. We continue to have ample cash and access to capital to fuel our growth initiatives. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 48, consistent with the third quarter and well within our normal range. We remain confident in the strength of our reserves. Our operating cash flow for the full year 2024 was $644 million, primarily reflecting the impact of risk corridor payments made in 2024. Recall that earlier this year, we made several large corridor settlements related to prior years. Now some additional details on our 2025 guidance. Beginning with membership, in Medicaid, we expect new membership growth from recent contract wins and growth in our current footprint to add over 100,000 members. We expect 2025 year-end membership of approximately 5 million members. In Medicare, we expect to begin 2025 with approximately 217,000 members based on strong open enrollment in our D SNP product, somewhat offset by our exit from MAPD in thirteen states for 2025. The acquisition of ConnectiCare adds 39,000 members. Combined with organic growth in our Medicare business, we expect to end 2025 with approximately 250,000 Medicare members.
Joe Zubretsky: In Marketplace,
Jeffrey Geyer: based on very strong open enrollment, we begin 2025 with approximately 546,000 members, representing 35% growth in our legacy business. To that, we add the acquisition of ConnectiCare with approximately 66,000 members. Effectuation rates among renewing members were in line with prior years, while the effectuation rates on our new members are stronger than in recent years. We expect smaller levels of SEP growth throughout the year compared to 2024, and forecast the year to end with approximately 580,000 members, almost 50% growth year over year. Our 2025 premium revenue guidance is approximately $42 billion, representing approximately 9% growth from 2024. Our expected premium revenue growth is comprised of several items: $2.1 billion from growth in our current footprint,
Joe Zubretsky: two
Jeffrey Geyer: $1.2 billion from the acquisition of ConnectiCare, and $600 million of revenue tied to recent RFP wins. Partially offsetting these growth drivers are minor headwinds due to the annualized impact of last year's Medicaid redeterminations and reduction in our Medicare MAPD footprint. Our 2025 guidance assumes the extension of our Virginia Medicaid contract well into 2025, while we expect the start of Texas Star chip contract to be delayed to 2026. Moving on to earnings guidance, we expect 2025 full-year adjusted earnings of at least $24.50 per share. Our EPS guidance reflects approximately $1.50 for the underlying organic growth in our legacy footprint, the realization of $1.50 of new store embedded earnings, and a $0.90 benefit from lower average share count in 2025. These items are partially offset by approximately $1 due to higher interest expense driven by the bond offering we completed in November, as well as lower net investment income. These components put our earnings outlook at $25.50 a share, an increase of 13% over 2024 full year. When we include the contract implementation cost of $1 for the recent Georgia and Medicare dual contract wins, our adjusted EPS guidance for 2025 is at least $24.50. I will note that these implementation costs are just 1% of the more than $5 billion in revenue we expect to see from the Georgia new contract win and the DUS wins in four states. Turning to our 2025 NCR guidance, we expect consolidated MCR of 88.7. Medicaid MCR at 89.9, 90 basis points above the high end of our long-term range, due to known and estimated rate increases just keeping pace with expected trends. This is almost in line with the 2024 normalized MCR of 89.8, which excludes the impact from new store businesses and the California retro item. So we expect full-year rate increases of 4.5% with 75% of our full-year premium already known, approximately 5%, and the remaining 25% estimated at 2.5%. Our Medicaid NCR guidance includes a trend assumption of approximately 4.5% and no impact from missed corridors as they remain constant over the two-year period. Favorable second-half rates versus our conservative estimates, any off-cycle rate adjustments, and further moderation and trend present upsides to our 2025 guidance. We expect Medicare MCR of 89%. The MCR reflects our conservative approach to 2025 bids and the expectation that utilization experienced in the second half of 2024 will continue into 2025. In Marketplace, we expect MCR of 79%, squarely within our long-term target MCR range of 78 to 80%. Moving on to select P&L guidance metrics, we expect an adjusted G&A ratio of 7%, which reflects 20 basis points of new business implementation costs and 20 basis points due to a higher mix of Marketplace membership, partially offset by leverage and increased scale of our business. Normalizing for these items, our guidance G&A ratio falls to 6.6, again demonstrating continued operating leverage year over year. In other guidance metrics, we expect an effective tax rate of 25.3%, adjusted pretax margin of 4.1%, within our long-term range, weighted average share count of 55.6 million shares, and we expect quarterly earnings to be evenly distributed throughout the year. Turning to embedded earnings, at our recent investor day, we had $6 of new store embedded earnings. To this, we add $1.25 for the Georgia Medicaid RFP win, $1 for our additional dual contract wins in four states, and the contract implementation cost of $1, leaving us with $9.25 from acquisitions and new contracts. Our 2025 guidance includes the realization of $1.50 to yield embedded earnings of approximately $7.75 going into 2026, giving us high confidence in our 13 to 15% long-term growth rate. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're now ready to take questions. Yes. Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. Any time you would wish to withdraw your question, you may press star then two. And we ask that in consideration of the other, you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. So with those instructions in mind, we will pause momentarily to assemble the roster. And this morning's first question comes from Andrew Mok with Barclays.
Andrew Mok: Hi, good morning. At the Investor Day, I think you gave us an illustration of what's needed to deliver on 89% Medicaid MLR in 2025. Can you give us a little bit more color on the components within that between rates
Joe Zubretsky: trend, and corridors that came in better or worse than expectations resulting in Medicaid MLR 90 basis points above that. Thanks.
Jeffrey Geyer: Sure. I'll Andrew, I'll frame it, and then I'll turn it to Mark. The MLR guide for 2025 in Medicaid is basically flat with 2024. We have good visibility into rates. We're projecting a 4.5% rate increase and a 4.5% trend off the 2024 baseline. That rate increase, 75% of it is known at 5%, 25% of it is estimated at 2.5%, lending to 4.5. On the trend number, we fully considered the second half pressure as we trended into 2025. All the pressures we saw in the second half of the year continue into the fourth quarter we included in our outlook for medical costs in 2025. That puts us only 90 basis points above the high end of our long-term range, which we feel really good that we're maybe a rate action or two, not a rate cycle, but a rate action or two away from being at the top end of our long-term range of 89. Mark, any color? Yeah. I'll just do a quick reconciliation of where
Joe Zubretsky: we are now versus what we said at IR Day.
Jeffrey Geyer: At IR Day, we were jumping off the second half of the year.
Joe Zubretsky: And we wound up 60 basis points higher in the second half of the year for the results of the fourth quarter. For Joe's comment, we also thought that the combination of rates, corridors, and trends would give us about 20 bps. They wound up being pretty much breakeven, so we got about zero out of that. So about 60 basis points worse on the jump-off point. And pretty much didn't get the rate versus trend of benefit of 20 bps that I was looking for at Investor Day.
Andrew Mok: Got it. And then in the prepared remarks, I think you said risk corridors didn't provide a material benefit. Can you help us understand how the geographic pressure played out such that there was no corridor benefit in the quarter? But I think you cited about 100 basis points remaining at the third quarter call. Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: It's a matter of geography. As we've always said, we're almost loathed to give a number of how deep we are in corridors because while it is a hedge, it's an imperfect hedge. If you have underperformance, it depends where that underperformance happens, whether you get the benefit of the corridor. In the fourth quarter this year, while we had forecasted, I believe, 50 basis points of trend pressure absorbed by the corridors, it didn't pan out that way. Mark, anything to add? That's exactly right. We're in 21 states.
Joe Zubretsky: And the benefit of the corridor is not evenly distributed across 21 states. So what really matters is where does the trend pressure show up versus where is corridor protection remaining. That could either help you significantly or it can leave you no benefit,
Andrew Mok: which is more or less what happened in the fourth quarter.
Jeffrey Geyer: Thank you. And the next question comes from Steven Baxter with Wells Fargo.
Steven Baxter: Hi, thanks. I appreciate the color on
Joe Zubretsky: the full year Medicaid MLR and the components impacting it. Was hoping you could give us, you know, also the fourth quarter breakdown if there's any lingering impact from new store, any impact from retros, either positive or negative. And then to the extent maybe there was any negative development in the quarter to potentially spike out in Medicaid. Just trying to understand the jump-off point, you know, a little bit more clearly to think about the achievability of guidance. Thank you.
Jeffrey Geyer: The Medicaid MCR in the fourth quarter, it actually was merely a case not to oversimplify it,
Joe Zubretsky: of
Jeffrey Geyer: fourth quarter dates of service trending at 1.2% versus the forecast of 50 basis points. There was no one-time items. There were no retros anticipated or received. It was from an accounting perspective, very, very clean. Trend outpaced our estimate. Corridor protection provided no benefit. The typical suspects, higher utilization, among the STAIRS population, particularly for LTSS, pharmacy, and PH. BH inpatient was up. And look at on the pharmacy side, it's not only GLP ones that are causing the pressure, but other high-cost
Joe Zubretsky: therapies.
Jeffrey Geyer: The trend pressure in the fourth quarter was
Joe Zubretsky: the same as we experienced in the third quarter and was not muted, benefited, or detrimental by any one-time items or artifacts.
Steven Baxter: K. And then just as a follow-up, would you be able to share the ID and R balance at the end of the year just to help us evaluate the reserve picture. Thank you.
Joe Zubretsky: Absolutely. On medical claims payable, you might have seen we're at $4.6 billion. The DCP, which is an imperfect measure, but I know why you guys use it, was 48. Just to put that in context, over the last three years, DCP averaged
Joe Zubretsky: 49. At the low was 47 one quarter. At the high was 51 one quarter, but averaged 49. The biggest driver of volatility around DCP and IV and R is how fast cash goes out the door. Right? Because the actuaries have a very consistent process of accruing liability. Having said that, cash payments are a little bit lumpy. So we're at 48. That's the same sequentially quarter over quarter, well within the middle of our range. I think that's a good proxy for the IVNR.
Steven Baxter: Thank you.
Jeffrey Geyer: The next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Hi, thanks. Good morning. Seems like the market MLR was worse in the fourth quarter. I'm not hearing much commentary around that. So maybe what the specific drivers were there relative to what you guys had put up at Investor Day
Joe Zubretsky: And then just back on the Medicare Advantage, maybe if you could give us a little bit more of the specifics on the Medicare Advantage pressures in 4Q, you know, especially in the acquired book from Bright and maybe what changes you made in 2025 to give you confidence in the bids.
Jeffrey Geyer: I'll turn it to Mark for the Marketplace commentary in Q4. Mark?
Joe Zubretsky: Absolutely. Hey, good morning, Josh. Look, nothing more on Marketplace than normal seasonality. As you know, because of deductibles, copays, things like that, Marketplace is fairly seasonal and tends to be running hotter later in the year. Look, we were at 83.3. Maybe it's a little bit higher than we thought too. But on a full-year basis coming in at a 75, we feel pretty good about the year. Just chuck it up to a little seasonal noise.
Jeffrey Geyer: And the only thing I'll add to that is the, you know, when you're coming in at 75 for full year. Now have two consecutive years of being able to invest what we call excess margins, margins that came in at 10% pretax, into the growth of the product. We're now one or two priced silver in 50% of our geographies. As Mark said, we ended the year with 400. We're gonna start the year with 600, end the year with 580,000 members. It's a great story. And we believe that given the dampening effect of special enrollment during the year, unlike last year, that it's a very stable book of business, and we have high confidence in the 6% pretax margin and the 79% MCR we're projecting for next year. For 2025. Medicare question mark? Yeah. Absolutely.
Joe Zubretsky: We reported a 93.8 on Medicare. Part of that is just the industry-wide trend that everybody's seeing. Joe mentioned the drivers of trend in Medicare. LTSS, both skilled nursing facility and in-home. Variety of pharmaceuticals. And then the inpatient and outpatient both have a number of drivers in them. Again, that's not unique to Molina. I think we're seeing that just about everywhere. Part of the story too, which compounds the MLR is on the revenue side. We wound up adjusting some of our risk adjustment ultimates. The way risk adjustment works is, obviously, you do a lot of provider in-office risk adjustment. We also do a lot of in-home assessments, the combination of those. We adjusted our ultimate and took down some of the revenue a little bit. That's kind of a one-time item. You know, the knock-on question, Josh, which I would expect you to ask is how does that tee you up for next year? And I think look. Rates aren't great for next year. We're pretty conservative on trend based on what we saw in Q3, Q4. So what you're seeing is not a strong move in MR year over year. Just reflecting a lot of that. You'll see us pretty much a little bit over the top end of our range for guidance, but nevertheless, we feel we're pretty conservative on trend just given what we saw in Q3, Q4.
Jeffrey Geyer: The only other comment I'd add on Medicare is the Bright business. While we have full confidence in the 1300 basis point turnaround, to get to the full dollar of accretion, we're not gonna be quite at breakeven this year. It'll be slightly lower, which is putting a little bit of pressure on the margins
Joe Zubretsky: But at 89% MCR for next year,
Jeffrey Geyer: a 2.2% pretax margin on nearly $6 billion of revenue, keys us up nicely to take advantage of the growth aspects of the duals and the integrated products. So we're quite bullish on our prospects here in Medicare. And with the early 2026 rate notice, I think, we're teed up for margin expansion in 2026 and beyond.
Josh Raskin: Thank you.
Jeffrey Geyer: Thank you. And the next question comes from Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Sarah James: Thank you. It sounds like you're assuming 4.5%
Joe Zubretsky: cost trends in 25% down from the 6% you were experiencing in 3Q. What was 4Q cost trend and what's driving your assumptions of cost trend lowering in 25?
Jeffrey Geyer: Let me do full year over year, and then I'll kick it to Mark. Because it can get quite complicated depending on which period you're comparing. In 2024, in Medicaid, our full our cost trend was 6.5%, half of which was the acuity shift to redetermination and half of which is what we call core utilization, high utilization of the continuing population. Comparing that to the 4.5% trend in 2025, the acuity shift doesn't recur. So we're actually projecting a 4.5% core utilization trend in 2025. Compared to a 3.25% core utilization trend in 2023, is 125 basis points higher. Now depending what period you compare, but we think that is a very clean and clear way of looking at it. We considered every nuance of utilization trend in the third and fourth quarters to inform that trend. Property by property, DRG by DRG, and we're very confident in that projection. Mark, anything to add? I would just repeat that, Joe, because it's a big point.
Joe Zubretsky: Last year was 6.5% trend, half of it was directly because of mix of redetermination, so the other half was just hot users, the stairs. So three and a quarter, three I call it, this year, we're projecting 4.5% trend, which is directly comparable to that three and a quarter number last year, so you can see we've got a pretty strong trend baked into our 2025 outlook. Now I think that's prudent based on where we are, but if the second half of last year was the new normal, that's assuming a pretty strong trend above what we've seen in other kinda normal quote, unquote, years. So pretty strong trend at four and a half. And as we've also mentioned, offsetting that trend of four and a half in 2025 is roughly four and a half percent of rates. When we think about rates, we parse known versus estimated. Seventy-five percent of our rates are known for 2025, at five percent. Twenty-five percent, we're still estimating, but we feel conservative at those rates at two and a half percent. So they waited average to four and a half. I know most of them. And I'm pretty conservative of what I'm estimating. But the high-level news for 2025 is four and a half percent trend assumption. Four and a half percent rate mostly known, some assumed.
Sarah James: That's helpful. Maybe just one more clarification. Since you know seventy-five percent of the rate and you have a pretty good view of where margins play, does that mean that you could get into your long-term goals for Medicaid margins for the whole of 2025, or would it be more exiting 2025?
Jeffrey Geyer: We would need
Joe Zubretsky: We conservatively estimated
Jeffrey Geyer: the twenty-five percent of rates we don't know at two and a half. And the seventy-five percent we do know came in at five. Is it conservative? Perhaps. So there could be some upside if we get rate increases north of the two and a half that we estimated. By the way, we never forecast retros, and we're our rate advocacy process, which is really robust, advocating for actually sound rates and all of our contracts, could provide some retroactivity in twenty-five on twenty-four, but we never forecast that. That would be additional upside if we achieve that.
Jeffrey Geyer: Thank you. And the next question comes from Justin Lake for free search.
Justin Lake: Thanks. Good morning.
Joe Zubretsky: I'll ask another question on trend just because you guys have done so a good job of kinda laying it out for us at the investor day and today. If I look at the investor day deck, you're saying in the third quarter, sequentially, you had a 2.6% increase in trends. Fourth quarter, now you're saying 1.2. Right? So just annualizing that back half into the first half of next year. But if I'm doing the math in my head correctly, it should be, like, two percent trend, you know, kinda just catch up. As you annualize. So I'm just trying to think, Joe, like, maybe you could talk to us in a similar way that you did as you did at the investor day. And today, like, just like, what are you really expecting for quarterly trend? If you think about those little, you know, kind of green bars, you put at the investor day deck, for trend. What would you, like, I would think they might only be fifty basis points a quarter. To get the four and a half percent because you still gotta annualize the back half of this year. Am I thinking about that incorrectly? Oh, you as I said, once you're answering a question,
Jeffrey Geyer: it gets really complicated depending on what period you wanna use. Obviously, if you use just the second half, the four and a half percent trend number is a lower number for 2025 than it is for 2024. To oversimplify the case. I'll turn it to Mark. Right. But we do have a lot of analysis on the quarterly progression of this. Mark? Hey, Justin.
Joe Zubretsky: So last year, we mentioned six and a half percent trend across the year. Full year. But at investor day, to your point, we also jumped off a second half of the year view. Just because we said, gee, maybe the second half is the new normal. So let's baseline off that. If you look at our guidance, full year over year, we said four and a half of rates, four and a half percent of trend. If you jump off of second half in the framework like we did at investor day, it would be more like two percent rates, two percent trend. And now that two percent, you can start to think more like in quarterly increments. You're probably closer to your fifty bps a quarter that you're thinking about.
Justin Lake: Perfect. Thanks. And then just a couple of quick numbers questions here. You talked about some one-time benefit in SG and A. Can you give us some more color on that? And then Joe, you said you're not, you know, rates away. You said you're rate action away. In one or two places. Can you tell us, like, can you give us any specificity of, like, is that it sounds like it's a couple of states. That you need some rate updates up from? Is that are those larger states? Or are they are smaller states where you need big rates or larger states where you're just waiting? For some true-ups there?
Joe Zubretsky: First thing I would say is the two and a half percent
Jeffrey Geyer: that we projected on rates that we don't know about is perhaps conservative. But let me frame it this way. The rate action versus cycle comment was merely to reflect we're operating no matter which way you cut this. Second half Q4, full year or 2025 guidance, we're operating a hundred basis points above the high end of our long-term range. A hundred. Based on analysis that we've done, external reports, regulatory filings, we believe that many market participants are operating at two, three, maybe even four hundred basis points above an acceptable NCR range. That might take a rate cycle. But when you're a hundred basis points above the long-term energy range, maybe a rate action too will get you there. That's my point. I don't think this has to cycle through one or two times in order to get there. Ninety basis points is, yeah, it's four bucks a share on thirty-two billion dollars of revenue. So if we can get back to the top end of our range when the market gets the rates it needs to get back into balance, we will comfortably be operating in the high eighties paying into the quarters like we were before all this happened, that's exactly where we wanna be. High eighties and paying into the corridors to provide that two hundred basis points of protection.
Jeffrey Geyer: Thank you. The next question comes from A. J. Rice with UBS.
A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody.
Joe Zubretsky: First, just wanted to ask about
A.J. Rice: quarterly progression across twenty-five, if there's anything you can do to help us
Joe Zubretsky: think about that. Obviously, you got the dollar of startup cost. I assume that's more back-end loaded.
A.J. Rice: You've got the rate updates, which we've been talking about on Medicaid and
Joe Zubretsky: maybe you would have a positive progression there contributing to EPS.
A.J. Rice: And then you've got more public exchange business, which is going to exacerbate the fourth quarter, it sounds like. Any way you can give us a little bit of flavor for how you think quarterly? Earnings layout over the course of the year?
Jeffrey Geyer: Sure. I'll turn it to Mark. When you have the items appropriately captured that factor into the seasonality projection of the business. Mark, caller. Hey, AJ. Good morning. Yeah. So normally, we're
Joe Zubretsky: little bit front-end loaded, with EPS. And what I'm saying this year is we'll be fifty-fifty, very evenly distributed quarter to quarter. So what's different? The first big driver is you've got a specific accounting of where we are on rates within the year quarter to quarter. We talked about how we know seventy-five percent of them, but we also know specifically when they come in. We also have a specific view on that trend number four and a half, how it seasonalizes. So you've got that as one of the bigger drivers.
A.J. Rice: Next, you've got just a little bit of carryover from new stores.
Joe Zubretsky: Last year. It's not it's not as big a phenomenon as it was last year. We're not gonna call significant attention to it, but you still got a little bit of that going on. So that more or less levels MRR quarter to quarter in the year. Now the other thing that's going on is G&A. I heard your statement, but believe it or not, we're front-end loaded on G&A this year with a lot of the initiatives we have. We have a bunch of go-readies January first of twenty twenty-six. And a lot of the IT spend, a lot of the upfront investment comes in early. Which front ends our G&A. So those things are a little bit different this year. I take your point on more Marketplace, which is typically a little bit back-end loaded on MR, yes. That's true. Like you put our three businesses together, we've got a pretty even outlook on our margins and therefore our EPS.
A.J. Rice: Okay. Alright. That's helpful. Then I just wanted to ask, I know
Joe Zubretsky: you guys mentioned in the prepared remarks about
A.J. Rice: keeping an eye on what's going on in Washington. Obviously, there's a lot of chatter about potential Medicaid reform. Is it a situation where at this point you're having some discussions with the states about how they might respond to some of these scenarios? And maybe relying on history, does it tend to push the states to put more of the people that they have
Joe Zubretsky: put in managed Medicaid into managed Medicaid? Does it
A.J. Rice: is there enough flexibility in the benefit design that if there's pressure on
Joe Zubretsky: Medicaid funding that they tweak benefits and how this
A.J. Rice: how does that impact your business? Any thoughts you can give us along those lines?
Joe Zubretsky: I can't. I can't give you any answers, but I can give you our thinking.
Jeffrey Geyer: And you're absolutely right about the way you're focused on it. Look, the market really focuses on the how. You know, if you come up with a per capita cap scheme, FMA match for reduction FMAP match reduction on expansion, block match, whatever the mechanism is the CBO can score. That's not the issue. The issue is what are you going to reduce in terms of where the money goes? You've got twenty-five million people in Marketplace, ninety-two percent sub twenty million people in expansion, hundred percent subsidized at ninety percent,
Joe Zubretsky: In twenty-five million uninsured population, nine and a half percent of the eligible
Jeffrey Geyer: Tell me which number you wanna see changed. Neither side of the aisle wants to see more uninsured. It's below ten percent of eligibles for the first time in decades. Reduction in benefits. Reduction in enrollment, reduction in payments to providers, or none of the above. And I either have to, as a state, decrease my education budget or raise taxes. None of those solutions is politically tenable. That's what the focus on. The way to cut a cost is actually actuarially and financially determinable. Where that would go is where the political tension exists. It's either gotta be membership benefits to existing members, membership, reductions of payments to providers, or higher taxes for the citizens of the state. Neither of those approaches is politically tenable. That's why we conclude that any changes to manage Medicaid as we know it today would be marginal.
Jeffrey Geyer: Thank you. And the next question comes from Adam Ron with Bank of America.
Adam Ron: Hey. Thanks. If I could ask two cleaner questions.
Joe Zubretsky: First, I think you mentioned in 4Q, you didn't get a lot of benefit from the risk corridors that you talked about in 2024. So if you could
Adam Ron: update your thinking around that and how
Joe Zubretsky: if you have any cushion for 2025 on risk corridor still and what it would take to realize them. And then second, if I could just squeeze the second question now,
Adam Ron: On Medicare, I think you mentioned MLR would be flat year over year versus 2024, but you grew membership and Q4 was
Joe Zubretsky: a little hot in terms of utilization.
Adam Ron: Then you have United guiding up MLR on
Joe Zubretsky: presumably Medicare. So curious what gives you comfort there. Thanks.
Jeffrey Geyer: Touch the first question first, and I'll take it to Mark. On risk corridor, what we're saying is the amount of corridor liability we have year over year is unchanged. Therefore, it's not providing a benefit or a detriment to the P&L. And when we're operating a hundred basis points above our target range, we're not gonna be deep into them, but we are into them in certain places. Now bear in mind, during a year, if you don't have a lot of corridor protection because you're not deep into them, there actually is at least potential for upside. If you outperform your forecast, you'll get to keep a lot of it or some of it. And so if we're projecting if we're looking at upside during the year, and we're not deep into the corridors in many places, and we're in the middle of them, then at least you get some of it to drop through to your bottom line. That's where we are on risk corridors year over year. Mark, you wanna take the Medicare question? Yeah. Absolutely.
Joe Zubretsky: So on Medicare, we reported an 89.1 for 2024. Let me walk you through a couple things to help the thinking on that. The first is, recall, we exited MAPD, traditional Medicare Advantage prescription drug, in thirteen states for 2025. While the revenue impact was not meaningful, the MR impact was. So take 40 bps off the 89.1, and normalize the jumping off point to 88.7. Okay. To that, we've got rates like everybody not that great for 2025. Call it two and a half percent for us. And I've got trend a little warmer than that. Now part of that's mitigated by our bid strategy, part of it's mitigated by our medical cost management. But two point seven ish on trend. Which nets you back to 89. So it's a lot about low rates. It's a lot about us, I think, being conservative on trends. And that 40 basis points benefit of jumping off helps us. But I think, no matter who you talk to, next year is a tough year in Medicare.
Jeffrey Geyer: Thank you. And the next question comes from Ryan Langston with TD Cowen. Hi. Good morning. This is Christian.
Ryan Langston: Could you remind us what your assumptions are on Marketplace membership attrition? Should APT
Joe Zubretsky: see?
Ryan Langston: But please not be extended? And then following that, is there any reason to expect that the Marketplace members picked up through this year's open enrollment could be perhaps any more or less sensitive to change in ATC.
Joe Zubretsky: Thanks.
Jeffrey Geyer: We took all the factors into consideration in our Marketplace member projection, whether that's SEP membership during the year, the natural attrition rate, the FTR, all those assumptions factor into a four percent reduction on a monthly basis, four percent reduction in membership throughout the year. Marketing together,
Joe Zubretsky: Yeah. I think that's fair. When people talk about the impacts of program integrity changes, the agent of record lock is largely behind us. FTR, everyone's debating that. But we really believe the quality of our membership because we have a lot of renewals. Seventy percent retention rate this year in spite of a huge growth rate on the top line of membership. We have seventy percent retention in our new renewal book. That and the enhanced integrity around agent of record we feel very good about the integrity of our membership. So what we see a little impact of FTR, maybe. But I don't think it's dramatic. And Joe summarized it best. You've got FTR. You've got effectuation. You've got normal attrition. And don't forget, SEP good guys keep coming. You roll all that together. We're modeling about four percent attrition a month. We feel pretty good about it.
Jeffrey Geyer: Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Hall with Baird. Hi. Thank you.
Michael Hall: With your MA, MLR, and back half pressure, I want to ask about the risk adjustment screw up first. Like, how much did they actually impact your MLR? And then just trying to understand
Joe Zubretsky: the more in mark you provided, great color on the trends. Onto next year. Just what how much with cotton and the bids since you're pairing down your MATV exposure, in thirteen states, conversely increasing your D SNP, it almost feels like you know, your book is now more shifted toward that elevated LTSS application utilization. So I'm just trying to gain overall better comfort in your pricing, your bids, and your margins for next year. Thank you.
Joe Zubretsky: Absolutely. So on DSNP, yes, we're increasing our exposure there a little bit. That's offset by the Bright book and now some of the Connecticut book. But remember, these trends in DSNPs that we saw rear up largely in Q3 and Q4, we've been conservative on our outlook for DSNP pricing, and I think a lot of competitors in the market have. Because our competitive positioning among many brokers has not changed. So I think a lot of people are dialing back in that way. We believe our benefit design anticipated a lot of this. Again, we've got guidance going to 89% next year. We think we picked up a lot of this trend. And more importantly, that same book of business has yielded a little bit over two percent pretax. So we think in spite of these headwinds, these are still attractive. And maybe the bigger point, Michael, is these DSNPs will get by, I believe, with 89% MOR, two percent pretax are such a big segue, though, into 2026 we move into the Feidie and Heidi environment, which just becomes a growth engine for us. With significantly more revenue, significantly bigger footprint. So we like 2025 as a jumping-off year into a lot of transition. I think bodes very well for the future.
Michael Hall: Got it. Thank you. And just one more
Joe Zubretsky: Exchange Marketplace. Yeah. It sounds like you're very confident on still
Michael Hall: achieving mid to mid to mid to high tax margins. Forty-four percent does feel pretty strong. And I know you're investing or reinvesting your excess margin. But was that the level of growth you had been expecting heading in
Joe Zubretsky: And it sounds like you're starting the year like, six hundred and twelve thousand
Michael Hall: tracking down to five eighty, and I think he mentioned four percent reduction monthly. But specifically related to the FTR recheck how much in the ineffectuation rate have you identified and you know, embedded in your guide specifically from, like, now through April or May when those recheck checks finish. Thank you.
Joe Zubretsky: So whenever we give you numbers, we give it net of our effectuation and other forms of attrition. So that you don't have to do additional math and hedge it. We believe we've hedged it with our best judgments on all those items. Now I heard you mentioned the forty-four percent statistic. A lot of people are throwing that around. I believe that quarter one versus quarter one a year ago, and that's a little bit of a dangerous growth number. Because what happened last year is SEP was so strong through the year that the Q1 number naturally grew dramatically across the year. So if you really look at jumping off of Q4, because we grew during the year, with all the SEP gains from redetermination, it's a significantly lower growth number Q4 to Q1. It's still a very nice growth number, but it's not forty-four. It's more like half that. Now the good thing is, once again, that's still a lot of growth. But with seventy percent renewal retention, it's a lot of growth, but it's also a lot of continuity with many of the same members. Which as you know from so many perspectives gives us more confidence in our margins. So, yes, a lot of growth, but if you look at all the growth we put on Q2, Q3, Q4, not such a big statement. And a lot of continuity coming into it with a really good renewal rate. Now we have, right now, probably a fluctuation rate in the mid-eighties. We feel really good about that. That's much higher than normal. And I think for two reasons. One, we've got much more renewal retention which means the fluctuation is gonna be higher. But the other thing is, I believe the agent of record luck really created a lot more quality of new membership or not churn membership so that members knew they were being signed up, were very active in the process, you're less likely to have lapses, non-payments, things like that. So I think boding well for this year, both on great effectuation rates but also great renewal retention rates.
Jeffrey Geyer: Thank you. And the next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens.
Scott Fidel: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to just actually just follow back up on the last question. Just still on the exchange margin expectations and I'm not sure if I'm missing something, but maybe you could help us with the bridge of you know, you guys talked about around seventy percent of the enrollment being from retention and what we saw know, your rates, you know, in terms of your same-store rates, I think they were sort of flat to down in terms of yield. For twenty-four to twenty-five. So just trying to get to sort of the comfort with the six percent margin. You know, around sort of the I guess the view on trend that you may have on those retained members or you know, anything else around the product design, that would sort of bridge, you know, given pretty minimal, you know, yield,
Joe Zubretsky: year over year on those members.
Jeffrey Geyer: I'll take it to market in a minute, but we consciously when you're producing ten percent to eleven percent pretax margins two years in a row, one, you gotta remain competitive. And two, if you keep it there, you're gonna run into the three-year minimum MLR. So it makes perfect sense to invest the excess margin and growth. It's a calibration. You try to set your product to be competitively positioned. As I said, we are number one or two silver priced in fifty percent of our geographies. We netted a hundred and thirty thousand members in open enrollment. Had, I think, two hundred fifty thousand ads and a hundred and thirty terms, which gave us a nice jumping-off point. So
Joe Zubretsky: we have high confidence in the mid-single-digit margin.
Jeffrey Geyer: The membership, as Mark said, being more stable, a higher percentage of it being renewal, means that you know the member, you know their clinical history, which gives you higher confidence in obtaining an appropriate risk score. So the fact that we have more stability in the book, less special enrollment during the year, and consciously invested a double-digit margin into growth makes all the sense in the world, and we believe the strategy is gonna work for 2025. Mark, is there anything to add? Yeah. Hey, Scott. So we're coming off
Joe Zubretsky: seventy-five in 2024. M o r. I've got us targeting a seventy-nine for 2025. Which means by definition, we're putting less rate into the market than Trent. That's exactly what's happening. I've got trend a couple hundred basis points above rate. Quite purposeful because as Joe mentioned, there's a minimum MOR out there, and I'd rather invest back into pricing and drive growth than do rebates. So we're seeing nice growth. We're seeing really good price positioning. And it's quite purposeful putting less rate into the market than we anticipate trends.
Scott Fidel: Okay. And then
Joe Zubretsky: in the follow-up, I was hoping to get just two numbers on your picks on twenty-five. For I don't think we saw investment income in the guys unless I'm mistaken. So I would love to give you the investment income expectation. And then also, how you're thinking about operating cash flow.
Scott Fidel: For twenty-five as well. Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Absolutely. So call it about four hundred million would be my implied investment income number. Within guidance, which, you know, is a little bit lower than we saw in 2024, but I'm sure you'll understand the drivers of that given the Fed's actions in this interest rate environment. So a little bit conservative there on investment income. And on operating cash flow, yeah. You know, I get this question a lot. On a full-year 2024 basis, operating cash flow is down. Versus 2023. That is true. But if you think about it, the vast majority of the explanation is simply the corridors. In 2023, I accrued significant corridors and didn't pay much down in cash. In 2024, we accrued significantly lower corridors. You're all familiar with that story. Yet paid down significant prior year corridors with cash. Therefore, explains the vast majority of my operating cash flow. Now for us, growing company, operating cash flow should always be higher than net income. In which you saw in 2023, it was the ratio was one point four. Last year, operating cash flow was below for the reasons I mentioned. And I think you'll see a swing in that back in 2025. What's more important though
Jeffrey Geyer: is cash flow at the parent
Joe Zubretsky: And we have a really good history of moving cash from the subsidiaries up to the parent where which is where you can really use it. To be clear, operating cash flow isn't usable when it's in the subs. Our track record of divviting to the parent is very efficient. So I feel very good about the cash flow to the parents that I give you. And our ability to deploy capital.
Jeffrey Geyer: Thank you. And this concludes the question and answer session as well as today's event. Thank you for dialing into today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-24 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to Molina HealthCare's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeffrey Geyer, Vice President Investor Relations at Molina HealthCare. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Geyer: Good morning and welcome to Molina HealthCare's third quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our third quarter 2024 earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and it's available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those of you who listened to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that all of the remarks are made as of today, Thursday, October 24th, 2024, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. On this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the third quarter 2024 earnings release. During the call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our 2024 guidance, Medicaid redeterminations, expected Medicaid rate adjustments and updates, medical cost initiatives and our projected MCR, our recent RFP awards and pending RFP submissions, our acquisitions and M&A activity, revenue growth related to RFPs and M&A activity, our long-term growth strategy, our 2025 marketplace pricing, and our embedded earnings power and future earnings realization. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our foreign 10-K annual report filed with the SEC, as well as our risk factors listed in our form 10-Q and form 8-K filings with the SEC. After completion of our prepared remarks, we'll open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?
Joe Zubretsky: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Today, we will provide you with updates on our reported financial results for the third quarter, highlighted by $6.01 of earnings per share, which was in line with our expectations. An update on our full year 2024 guidance, which we reaffirm at $38 billion of premium revenue and at least $23.50 in earnings per share, and our growth initiatives and strategy for sustaining profitable growth. Let me start with our third quarter performance. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.01, a $9.7 billion of premium revenue. Our 89.2% consolidated MCR was higher than expected as we experienced some medical cost pressure in our Medicaid and Medicare segments. However, we still produced a 4.5% adjusted pre-tax margin or 3.4% after tax, a very strong result. Year to-date, our consolidated MCR is 88.8%, slightly above our long-term target range, and our adjusted pre-tax margin is 4.5%, which is within our long-term target range. Together, these results reflect a well-balanced and well-performing portfolio of businesses. In Medicaid, the business produced a third quarter MCR of 90.5%, above our long-term target range. This result included a premium rate reduction in our California business that was retroactive to the beginning of the year. We are working with the state to understand its methodology and actuarial support for this adjustment, both of which remain unclear. Excluding this retroactive item, the third quarter Medicaid MCR was 90%. The quarter reflects higher than expected medical costs, elevated by the impact of redetermination related to acuity shifts and higher utilization among our continuing population, particularly for LTSS, pharmacy, and behavioral health services. However, this higher trend continued to be partially offset by three dynamics. First, our new store additions continue to improve toward target margins. Second, on-cycle and off-cycle rate adjustments went into effect during the quarter. And finally, our risk corridors continue to act as a financial buffer against elevated medical cost trend. The short-term disparity between rates and medical cost trend may have reached its widest point in the third quarter. We expect this short-term disparity to narrow, starting with known rate updates. In the third quarter, we received five on-cycle rate updates that averaged 4.5%. We also received several positive off-cycle rate adjustments, which is an important indication that many of our states have recognized that certain aspects of their program are underfunded. For the fourth quarter, we received three on-cycle rate updates that averaged 9%. In total, the second half of 2024 now reflects these known rate increases that amount to a benefit of approximately $350 million, or 230 basis points on the Medicaid MCR. This 230 basis point benefit, along with risk corridor protection, is expected to substantially offset the elevated cost trend in the second half of 2024. Looking forward to 2025, the progression of rates and cost trend is not entirely clear. 55% of our Medicaid premium renews on January 1st, and we are encouraged by the draft rates we have seen from several of these states. These draft rates are an important starting point for 2025, and we remain cautiously optimistic while we wait to see how medical cost trend progresses in the fourth quarter and early 2025. Given the confluence of the many MCR dynamics concentrated in the quarter, we are very pleased to be operating at a 90% Medicaid MCR for the full year, nearly 100 basis points above the top end of our long-term range. With the assumption that rates may continue to improve in appropriately captured cost trend in this upcoming rate cycle, there is line of sight to be operating within our long-term MCR target range for 2025. Turning to Medicare, our third quarter MCR was 89.6%, above our long-term target range. The medical cost pressure in the quarter was consistent with the elevated LTSS and pharmacy costs we experienced through the first half of the year, while we also experienced higher outpatient utilization in the third quarter. Our bright business in California performed in line with expectations. In marketplace, the third quarter MCR was 73%. The business continued to perform better than our expectations, even with the higher special enrollment period membership gained from redeterminations this year. Our third quarter adjusted G&A ratio of 6.4% was a very strong result and reflects effective operating discipline, including labor cost management, one-time credits related to vendor contracts, and leveraging our fixed cost base as we grow. Turning now to our guidance for the full year. Our full year premium revenue remains unchanged at approximately $38 billion, or 17% year-over-year growth. We maintain our full year adjusted EPS guidance of at least $23.50, representing 13% year-over-year growth. We expect continued strong performance in our marketplace segment, G&A efficiencies, and higher net investment income to offset the higher MCRs we are experiencing in Medicaid and Medicare. Our 2024 revenue and earnings per share guidance provide a strong foundation for profitable growth in 2025 and beyond, and the building blocks to achieve our long-term growth targets remain intact. Now, some comments on our growth initiatives. Our business is well-positioned to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities in all three segments. In traditional Medicaid, as previously reported, we retained our presence in Florida with a contract to serve approximately 90,000 members in Miami-Dade County. This contract recovery is an important component of our portfolio, given the state of Florida's significant Medicare and marketplace profile. In Georgia, we await the announcement of statewide contract awards. We remain confident in the strength of our proposal and our ability to serve as strong state partners for these populations. We had significant wins in the quarter in our dual-eligible integrated product businesses, which are a major strategic focus for us. In Michigan, we were awarded a contract to provide benefits to the state's highly integrated dual-eligible special needs population in six service regions, including Detroit. This is an increase from our current MMP footprint of two service regions. This win facilitates the transition of our existing MMP members to a high-d product and ensures a new dual-eligible growth opportunity. We project $1 billion of incremental premium revenue by 2027 and have added $0.50 per share to our embedded earnings. The contract, which is effective January 1st, 2026 in select regions, will be implemented statewide in 2027 and continue for seven years. Given our success in this Michigan MMP transition, we are confident about our prospects in both Ohio and Illinois. In Massachusetts, the Commonwealth awarded us a new contract to operate the One Care Under 65 program and retain our position in the Senior Care Options Program for 2026. Incremental revenue is expected to reach nearly $400 million in three years' time, and for this, we have added $0.25 per share to our embedded earnings. Also in Medicare, beginning in 2025, we will no longer offer MAPD products in 13 states, totaling approximately $200 million in annual premium. This adjustment allows us to strategically focus on our dual-eligible populations, where we increased our county footprint by 23% and on our low-income MAPD population in California. Recall the new CMS final rule on integration positions us well as a major Medicaid player. In Marketplace, we are positioned to grow organically in under-penetrated markets, given the stabilized risk profile and margins we've achieved. Our rate filings for 2025 are very competitive and position us to grow in under-penetrated markets. We are confident in our strategy to grow the segment at a rate that allows us to achieve mid-single-digit pre-tax margins. Finally, we continue to expect that our announced acquisition of ConnectiCare will close in the first quarter of 2025. Our ability to grow organically, win new state contracts, and execute M&A are the pillars of our growth strategy, and we fully expect to meet our target of $46 billion of premium revenue in 2026. With our 2024 earnings per share guidance of at least $23.50 reaffirmed, and with our embedded earnings raised to $5.75 per share, we remain on track to deliver long-term profitable growth. Mark will discuss the building blocks of our 2025 outlook in his remarks. In summary, we are pleased with the quarter's results as we continue to power through unprecedented short-term dynamics and just keep executing on the fundamentals. Our businesses remain on solid operational and financial foundations, and are positioned well for long-term profitable growth. We look forward to updating you on the next wave of long-term value creation at our Investor Day event on Friday, November 8th in New York City. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark?
Mark Keim: Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss some additional details in our third quarter performance, the balance sheet, our 2024 guidance, and the building blocks of our 2025 EPS and outlook, beginning with our third quarter results. For the quarter, we reported approximately $10 billion in total revenue and $9.7 billion of premium revenue, with adjusted EPS of $6.01. Our third quarter consolidated MCR of $89.2 was above our expectations, reflecting some pressure we experienced in Medicaid and Medicare during the quarter. In Medicaid, our reported MCR was $90.5. As Joe mentioned, this result includes a 50 basis point increase due to a premium rate reduction in our California business that was retroactive to the beginning of the year. With much of our California revenue in the new store first year of operations stage, corridors were not quite at the target margin levels, so much of the impact of this rate action fell through to our bottom line. We are still working with the state to understand the rationale for this rate adjustment. It's highly unusual for a state to retroactively reduce rates, and all of our other known and expected future rate actions are positive as states address recent medical cost trends. Adjusting for this retroactive item, our reported MCR of $90.5 falls to $90. This was in line with the second quarter and remained elevated versus our expectations, driven primarily by higher than expected medical costs in our legacy Medicaid portfolio. Recall the dynamics of redetermination involve joiners, leavers, and stayers. Redetermination related acuity shifts continued into the third quarter, even as the imbalance of joiners and leavers began to stabilize. We saw a higher utilization among our stayers population, particularly for LTSS, pharmacy, and behavioral health services. Several dynamics served to offset these higher trends in the third quarter and muted the overall impact. First, our new store additions, which represent approximately 20% of Medicaid premium and have a higher than average MCR in their first year, improved during the quarter and remain on track to achieving target margins. Second, we had on cycle and off cycle rate adjustments in 11 states. And finally, due to our strong medical cost management, we started the year deep into risk corridors, which acted as a buffer and created a more muted impact of this acuity shift. Medicaid membership at the end of the third quarter was 4.9 million and in line with the second quarter. Some continuing redeterminations in a few states in July and August were largely offset by the implementation of our New Mexico contract in the quarter. We continue to see reconnects from prior period terminations and expect continuing upside to membership from reconnects in the quarters ahead. In Medicare, our third quarter reported MCR was 89.6. Higher medical costs in the quarter reflected continued higher utilization of LTSS and pharmacy. We also experienced higher outpatient utilization in the third quarter, concentrated in our decent population. Separately, I will note that the prior year risk adjustment true-ups in the second quarter drove a portion of the sequential increase in the MCR. Our bright business in California performed in line with expectations. In Marketplace, our third quarter reported MCR was 73 and better than expected. Special enrollment period membership increased during the quarter, but at a slower rate than the first half of the year. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 6.4 and reflects effective operating discipline, including labor cost management, one-time credits related to vendor contracts and leveraging our fixed cost base as we grow. Turning to the balance sheet, our capital foundation remained strong. In the quarter, we harvested approximately $385 million of subsidiary dividends and our parent company cash balance was approximately $195 million at the end of the quarter. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares. Our full-year guidance now assumes 57.9 million shares outstanding. Debt balances and the debt-to-capital ratio increased slightly in the quarter due to our share repurchases. Debt at the end of the quarter was 1.4 times trailing 12-month EBITDA with our debt-to-cap ratio at about 35%. We continue to have ample cash and capital to fuel our growth initiatives. During the quarter, we also renewed our revolving credit facility for another five years and increased its capacity to 1.25 billion. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 48. We remain confident in the strength of our reserves. Our operating cash flow in the first nine months of 2024 was $868 million. This was lower than the prior year, but consistent with our comments last quarter, reflects the timing of risk corridor payments, CMS receipts, and taxes. Recall that earlier this year we made several large corridor settlements related to prior years. Next, a few comments on our fourth quarter and 2024 guidance. As Joe mentioned, we reaffirm our full-year premium revenue guidance of approximately $38 billion and our full-year EPS guidance of at least $23.50. While full-year EPS guidance is unchanged, the performance in the second half of the year changes the components as compared to our previous guidance. EPS guidance has increased by $2.70 from the combined tailwinds of strong performance in marketplace, G&A efficiencies, and higher net investment income, but will be offset by the higher MCRs in Medicaid and Medicare for a net unchanged view of full-year guidance. We now expect full-year 2024 MCR of 88.7% and G&A ratio of 6.8%. Within Medicaid, we expect fourth quarter MCR of 89%, a decrease from 90.5% in the third quarter. The 150 basis point improvement is driven by three items. First, 50 basis points from the third quarter retroactive premium adjustment in California that will not recur. Next, 80 basis points from known on-cycle and off-cycle rate increases and some benefit of our corridor position will offset trend. Finally, continued improvement in new store additions will contribute 20 basis points. We expect full-year Medicaid MCR of approximately 90, up 70 basis points from our prior guidance, reflecting higher cost trend and approximately 10 basis points for the full-year impact of the third quarter retroactive premium adjustments in California. In Medicare, we expect fourth quarter MCR of 90, an increase from 89.6 in the third quarter. This guidance assumes the third quarter utilization persists for the remainder of the year and increases the full-year MCR to 88.3, a 30 basis point increase from our prior guidance. In Marketplace, we expect fourth quarter MCR of 78.1, compared to 73 in the third quarter. This increase reflects the normal marketplace seasonality during the year and the significant SEP growth we experienced year-to-date. We expect full-year marketplace MCR of 74, down 400 basis points from our prior guidance, reflecting strong year-to-date performance. Turning to embedded earnings and the building blocks of our 2025 EPS outlook. New store embedded earnings are now $5.75, with the addition of contract wins in Michigan and Massachusetts. Both contracts are expected to begin in 2026 and achieve target margins in 2027. We expect to harvest a little less than half of our embedded earnings in 2025. The building blocks include those embedded earnings we expect in 2025, the organic growth and margin in our current footprint, our in-flight organic and strategic initiatives, and the year-over-year benefit of share repurchases executed in the third quarter of 2024. We expect some headwinds from declining interest rates next year. We caution that rates have not yet caught up with trend, and our corridor productions are now lower until replenished by the new cycle of actuarially sound rates. While it is not yet clear how the short-term disparity between rates and trends will progress, these known building blocks are an important foundation to our sustaining long-term profitable growth. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're now ready to take questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Josh Raskin: Hi, thanks. I'd like to ask my second question first. So the strength in marketplace, does that change your view on the impact of potential rebate positions in 2025, just based on what you've seen in the last two years here? And could you just remind us your views? I think you mentioned sort of that mid-single-digit margin, just sort of how you're titrating additional growth in 2025 versus offsetting rebates versus sort of maintaining that mid-single-digit margin?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, Josh, this will be the second straight year of outperformance in marketplace and in '24 into '25, we did invest that excess margin in our bids and expect to grow the business. And yet here we are again with another year of outperformance and we'll continue to do the same. So yes, we're targeting mid-single-digit pre-tax margins, but the business is positioned to grow really well next year and the year after. Now, with respect to the rebate question, recall it's a three-year test and also recall that an 80% minimum is equivalent mark to what? About a 75% GAAP equivalent, correct?
Mark Keim: Right around there. Josh, we're tracking to a 74 in our guidance this year. As Joe mentioned, the 80 nominal that everybody thinks of a minimum MLR is more like a 76-ish. And as Joe mentioned, you can either pay it in a rebate or make it up on volume through pricing and that's the direction we'll take.
Josh Raskin: Okay, so you guys are in a rebate position. Your point is you can get that 200 basis point delta for next year. And then just a quick follow-up on the Medicaid MLR. I think it's running full year. It looks like 70 basis points higher than your previous. So, maybe if you could just drill down a little bit more on LTSS, behavioral health and RX and what's running specifically worse? What are those incremental pressures coming from?
Joe Zubretsky: We expected in our initial guidance a trend in Medicaid of about 3% and it's landing at about six. It's split sort of equally between redetermination impact and impact of higher utilization of what I call our continuing membership. No one phenomenon is really driving it. It's a blend of GLP-1s and RX, LTSS both skilled nursing facility in patient stays and hours in home service benefits. And then of course the national phenomenon of behavioral services trending upwards as well. Really no one thing and its different in every geography, but those are the trends we're observing. Mark, anything to add?
Mark Keim: No, I think that's right versus the initial guidance or expectations for the year. We're up about 300 basis points on trend. Joe mentioned its split between rededicuity and its split between stayers running a little bit hotter, BH, LTSS, pharmacy. We're seeing them in pockets here, pockets there but those are national trends.
Josh Raskin: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from J.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.
A.J. Rice: Hi everybody, I think it's AJ but anyway. If your trend is running at about 6% that would imply the rate updates you need to normalize are probably in that range maybe a little bit higher over the next year. That's quite a bit different as you may know from what at least one of your large peers is saying they need, they're talking about a low-to-mid double digit rate increases. And they've also raised the question about whether state budgets can afford to update in one year what's necessary or whether we might need multiple cycles. I guess I don't know if you can comment on why there might be a difference between what you're seeing and what they're seeing, but I'll throw that out and see if I can get you to confirm the order of magnitude of the rate update you need to normalize and whether you think that's achievable over the next year.
Joe Zubretsky: Let me first, AJ, comment on the model of how we've been describing this since redetermination started. We knew there would be an acuity shift without question. It takes time for a state actuary to observe the acuity shift and allow rates to rate for it. There's a gap there. Being 200 basis points deep into the risk corridors would act as a buffer until rates caught up and that's exactly what's happening here. Obviously we're a bit short, but we're operating comfortably at 90% no matter how you cut it, we're operating comfortably at 90%. Now with respect to rates, what gives us encouragement and great comfort are the rate updates we saw in the second half of the year, $345 million of pre-tax benefit to the second half, 230 basis points in the MCR. Some of those rate updates were off cycle, meaning that states truly have recognized that components of their program were underfunded. The on cycle rate adjustments in the third quarter averaged 4.5%. The on cycle rate adjustments in the fourth quarter averaged nearly 9%. Now we've only seen a handful of draft rates for 1-1 when 55% of our revenue renews but we've been encouraged by what we've seen at this early stage. So how it all maps out depends on what cost trend emerges in the fourth quarter as to whether the strength of those 1-1 rates will truly get us back to our target MCR. Mark, anything to add?
Mark Keim: Joe, I think that's really well summarized. There's no doubt that there's a little bit of a lag between trend and when states recognize it. But as Joe mentioned, five on cycle, seven off in the third quarter, three more in the fourth quarter, the timing will never be perfect but part of our equation here is those corridors make up that difference until we get to the New Year and the new rate cycle. So I think a combination of the states being fairly responsive and the corridor position, we're confident in our outlook.
A.J. Rice: Okay. That's helpful. Just on your utilization trends that you're seeing, and you called out the areas of Medicaid, it sounds like you're seeing a little bit of that in Medicare. Just trying to parse out, are these just the way the market is at this point or you need to get that in your rate updates both for Medicaid or Medicare or is there medical management opportunities for you to push back on some of what you're seeing?
Joe Zubretsky: Well, I think it's all relative, right? Because we all get the same rates and we're all observing the same gross trends, supply-driven, demand-driven. We have proven on a sustainable basis that we are managing medical costs effectively. Otherwise, we would not have historically been 200 basis points deep into the corridors on average for the past three or four years. So as rates renew, those corridors replenish and given our expertise in medical management, care management, driving great quality scores, risk adjustment, et cetera, we plan to, and it is our intention to always be operating below whatever state benchmark exists in a minimum MLR or a corridor to always have that financial buffer available to us.
Mark Keim: The only thing I'd add, Joe, is when we talk about trend, we talk about net trend. So the benefit of the medical cost management that we do, UMCM, all that, is already in the numbers that we report. I think maybe when you hear higher trend numbers from other folks, they may have different views on how they do medical management. But again, we talk about net trends, net of all the things we do to manage costs.
A.J. Rice: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Joe Zubretsky: Thank you.
Operator: Apologies to you, Mr. Rice, for misspeaking your name. The next question comes from Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Sarah James: Thank you. Can you help us think about what a clean jumping off point for 3Q is? You guys mentioned a one-time vendor credit. How big was that? I think also an unusual tax item. And was any of the 80 basis points pressure on the core Medicaid MLR out of period? And then just a clarification. Is it -- should we think about it as 80 plus the 200 basis points risk corridors, so really 280 year-over-year? That'd be great. Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: We'd have to parse your question into various pieces. But as I said, we are, no matter whether you pro forma the second quarter to the third, the third quarter to the fourth or the full year, we are comfortably operating Medicaid at 90% MCR. In fact, for the full year embedded in our guidance is an 89.3% MCR on the legacy book. That's only 30 basis points above the top end of the range. So we have a bridge, and Mark will give it to you here in a second, how we get from 90.5 in the third to 89 in the fourth, which would then support our guidance. Mark?
Mark Keim: Yes, absolutely. So the jumping off point on the third quarter, we reported a 90.5, but as you know, 50 basis points was that one time I had been in California. So we're jumping off a 90 from a clean basis on a third quarter. When we look at our rates and our trend in our corridors, I'm seeing a pretty significant improvement. I'm targeting an 89 for the fourth quarter. The way I get there off of a 90 is rates. We have three states with known on-cycle rates, which give me 80 bps of good guy for the fourth quarter. I'm going to assume trends another 50 bps in the fourth quarter, and I know I have corridors roughly to offset that. You add a little bit of benefit from our new stores, which continue to give us a 20, 30 bps every quarter as they progress to their targets. That's your trajectory to get from a 90 adjusted to an 89. Now on G&A, you asked also about the jumping off point. We reported a 6.4 in the third quarter. That benefited from some vendor credits, a little bit was retro, but a little bit is sustaining. Just to cut to the chase on that, my full year guidance will be a 6.8 on G&A. I think that gives you the building blocks to model out the rest of the year.
Sarah James: Great, thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Stephen Baxter: Yes, hi, thanks for the question. I appreciate the color on the bridge to the fourth quarter. So I'm going to follow up a little bit on that. You mentioned some of your factoring and potential for some incremental trend. I guess when you think about the negative impact from acuity shifts that have been driving up, MLR sequentially, rejoiner dynamics presumably contribute into that as well. Is your expectation now given where we are in the cycle that this negative incremental pressure has largely stopped as we enter the third, enter the fourth quarter, or is that factored into your thought process as continuing at least for another quarter or two? Thank you.
Mark Keim: So in the third quarter, we had pretty meaningful trend as did everybody, right? And I think there were two dynamics in the third quarter. One, there was a little more carryover from redetermination. One, it's just the weighted average math. Redetermination mostly stopped in the second quarter, but the weighted average math carrying into the third quarter put a little pressure in the third quarter. The other thing is I had a couple of states that continued to do determinations in the third quarter. I had two states in particular that extended into the third quarter. So we saw a little bit more of the joiners, leavers dynamic into the third quarter than I would have otherwise expected. And of course, the leavers having a little bit higher utilization. I don't think either of those are sustaining, which is why I'm suggesting more like a 50 basis point trend in the fourth quarter over the third, kind of coming back to a new normal.
Operator: Was there a follow-up, Mr. Baxter?
Stephen Baxter: Yes. Well, I guess I'm going to make a follow-up, I appreciate, just a little bit of like what the states, in terms of the rate update process are really seeing here. I mean, like to follow up on a previous question, we've kind of heard from peer companies that there's often a multi-year lag to the claims base needed to reset rates. So in terms of the rate updates being so large today? Is it truing up acuity factors largely because we've seen enrollment drop off more than what had been previously projected, just trying to understand what is making its way into the rates and why, given that the claims experience obviously is still very dynamic? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: The rate process has not changed. The rate setting process starts with a credible baseline. Every state has a view of where that baseline should lie, whether it's a year prior, two years prior, pre-pandemic trend off the baseline. And acuity shifts, for any reason, are always part of the rating process. The only thing that's different now is that the acuity shift is far more dramatic, given the 92 million enrollees down to 72 million in a short period of time. So nothing's really changed in the rating model process. It works exactly the way it's worked historically. The only thing that's different is the acuity shift is more prominent. And by the way, it's not a secret. I mean, its high profile. Every state knows it, and there's laser focus on it. So the fact that we're getting updates that seem to be capturing it should be no surprise.
Operator: The next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Justin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to focus on your 2025 comments. First, are you confirming that you believe you could do 13% to 15% next year? And specifically, Mark, you gave just about $3 of that embedded earnings kind of comes in next year, which is a great tailwind. On the other hand, you talked about a bunch of help from investment income and G&A and marketplace that might not reoccur. That is almost a similar number. I think you said it was like $2.70. So just trying to think about those moving parts and whether you still see that when combined with core growth, getting you to that 13 to 15 target or where you expect to be in there?
Joe Zubretsky: Well, I think, Justin, it's Joe, I think the items that are easy to get your arms around are the embedded earnings because we have visibility into them. As Mark said, would there be a headwind from that investment income? That's pretty obvious. The unknown is when we talk about growth off the footprint, that's usually pretty easy to predict. But we need to see how medical cost trend emerges in the fourth quarter into the first to then conclude that the 1-1 rates, 55% of our revenue are appropriately capturing it. So normally, we'd be able to give you a really good point estimate in a normal environment that our footprint should produce a buck, a buck 50, two bucks a share. Right now, we're hesitating to do that until we see more in the fourth quarter. Mark, anything to add?
Mark Keim: Yes, a couple things. Justin, just to set the table, you mentioned $2.70. That was part of my bridging on 2024 guidance. How versus prior guidance, I'm up now $2.70 on a bunch of good guys and down $2.70 on the trend in Medicaid and Medicare. So that's current year. Let's put that aside. For 2025 guidance, Joe hit it exactly right. With some of the vagaries we have right now on trend and rate, we're optimistic, but we're not ready to lay out specific numbers on that. Now, the biggest component of next year is the embedded earnings. As you know, we're now up to $5.75 on embedded earnings. And I said in my prepared remarks, we expect a little less than half of that to emerge next year. Pressures on net investment income, you got that one absolutely. And you're aware we did a small stock repurchase in the third quarter, which you'd want to factor into your numbers as well.
Justin Lake: Okay, great. And then just to follow up on the rates, it sounded like you got some pretty good retro rates in the quarter. You mentioned that headwind from California, retro cut. Was there any tailwind from some of these rates in the third quarter, especially the off cycle rates being also retroactive that we need to consider in that jump off point or were none of those retro?
Mark Keim: The rates that we got in the third quarter are obviously a good jumping off point going forward. The retro rates are not only retro, but also imply a new go forward basis. So you can jump off third quarter with confidence. And then Joe mentioned we had three new rates in the fourth quarter, which are factored into my fourth quarter outlook.
Justin Lake: Right Mark. But to the extent they are retro, you would have dollars in the quarter that don't belong in the quarter. Just like California doesn't belong in the cut, right? Was there any of that, like any offset to that 50 bps?
Mark Keim: Just a little bit, just a little bit. But when I give you my bridge from third quarter to fourth quarter, that's in my net rating increase.
Justin Lake: Okay. Thank you.
Mark Keim: You bet.
Operator: The next question comes from Andrew Mok with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Andrew Mok: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the exchanges. Can you help us understand the drivers of the outperformance in the quarter and how would you compare this year's SEP membership to performance of prior years? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: The SEP membership this year in marketplace has been extraordinary. I think in the second quarter it was 90,000 plus, it leveled off to 60,000 and then 50,000 each of the last three quarters. A normal SEP membership gain in that business is 20,000 to 25,000. So you can see that it benefited by the Medicaid redetermination process without question. Normally that SEP membership comes in with higher acuity and runs higher MCRs. This year the SEP membership came in running higher than the traditional book, but not as high. It's due to a younger demographic, a more healthy demographic, and it didn't put as much pressure on the MCR as it had done historically, likely due to the fact that many of those members came in for Medicaid. So the business is performing well, and I'd rather have excess margin than not, because I can always invest excess margin in growth, which is exactly what we plan to do.
Andrew Mok: Got it. And if I could just follow up, can you help us understand how the revenue recognition works for off-cycle rate adjustments? Do you wait for those payments to be received or are you able to recognize those when you have a certain level of assurance and visibility into those payments? Thanks.
Mark Keim: Yes, we have a really tight accounting standard on that. We need documented evidence, not just suggestion or conversation. We book on documented evidence.
Andrew Mok: Great, thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Adam Ron with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Adam Ron: Hey, thanks so much. I have a question about core trend and the difference between what you're seeing on that versus the rate and acuity mismatch. First, has that core trend accelerated throughout the year, such that, 2Q is higher than 1Q, 3Q is higher than 2Q, and you expect 4Q to be higher, and if not, what gives you confidence that it will flow? And then second, if you could just break out the magnitude of how you're seeing core trend versus the acuity rate mismatch and overall how that stacks up? I think one of your competitors said it was roughly a third core trend and two-thirds acuity versus rate. Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: As I said previously, and I'll kick it to Mark, I'll just take Medicaid to keep the conversation simple. We had anticipated a net trend of 3% in our initial guidance. That has increased to 6%, and I guess you could say, yes, it had built during the year. We still have a trend increase going into the fourth. Even off this incredibly high cost baseline, we still, in our forecast, had a slight trend increase into the fourth quarter. The combination of rates, trend, and corridors are the reason we're operating at 90 and not 89. So, it worked exactly the way we had predicted with corridors acting as a buffer until rates caught up. And that is happening. Now, we're still cautious on the 1-1 rates, as I said before, but the model is working exactly as we have predicted. The corridors act as a financial buffer, giving rates time to catch up with trend. Yes, trend did build over the year.
Mark Keim: Yes, and I think, Adam, the easiest way for me to think about it, because you get into timing issues quarter to quarter, what came in when, was something retro, on a full-year basis, as we said before, trend is 3% higher than I initially thought in the outlook, just for all the reasons we all know. Rates are 1.5% better than I initially thought. I'm using 1% of my corridors on a full-year basis to offset some of that mismatch, which is largely why full-year guidance went from 89 to 90. The difference in all that math is obviously you've got a couple of California retro items in there, but those are the big items, and on that trend, what we've been very clear about is part of it is the ongoing imbalance of joiners and leavers, and part of it is those stayers running just a little bit hotter than most of us expected.
Joe Zubretsky: Yes, and I keep coming back to the legacy book, because the California retro and the new stores create a little bit of obfuscation, but the third quarter legacy book is going to produce an 88.8, the second half is an 89.3 in the full year, legacy book is 89.3. In this incredibly difficult time of a huge shift in the risk pool, we're operating on our legacy book only 30 basis points above the high end of our range, combination of corridor protection, rates catching up to an accelerated trend.
Adam Ron: Appreciate it.
Operator: The next question comes from Ryan Langston with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Ryan Langston: Hi, thank you. You called out higher utilization pharmacy, behavioral LTC. I'm curious if any other service lines might have come in maybe better than you had expected in the 3Q? And then just on the behavioral side, you called out Kentucky last quarter specifically. Is that higher utilization still isolated to that state, or are you now seeing that more maybe broad based on other geographies? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: I'll answer the second question first and kick the first question to Mark. On behavioral, the reason we cited Kentucky, it was a program change that caused it. There is a suspension of utilization management in Kentucky during the pandemic, which of course caused behavioral costs to go up. We are seeing pockets of trend inflection on behavioral services broad based across the country. In Kentucky, it was more pronounced because of the program change. But the stigma over receiving behavioral services is removed. Providers are open for business. They really suffered in terms of service revenue during the pandemic. And of course, the pandemic created all kinds of behavioral issues in the population. So it is a national trend. The reason we called out Kentucky, it was because of a program change.
Mark Keim: And back on the utilization management side, we certainly called attention to some of the challenges. I wouldn't call any specific good guys out. State by state, we're in 21 states. Every state has its own story with some unique items going on here and here. But as a national trend, I wouldn't cite any specific good guys within trend.
Ryan Langston: Okay. Thank you.
Mark Keim: You bet.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Hall with Baird. Please go ahead.
Michael Hall: All right. Thank you. Something I've been thinking about more and questioning is, I understand D-SNP lives have, I think, a six-month grace period in terms of redetermination. So granted, I think most duly eligible lives aren't actually in the job market. But just give how high revenue PMPMs are, even just a few percent change to drive compressor on MLR. So I'm curious to hear what you've seen on D-SNP redeterminations. Is there potential, excuse me, unexpected tail risk on these lives due to the grace period? And just trying to figure out if there's another potential shoe to drop here.
Joe Zubretsky: I'm only pausing, Michael, because I'm having difficulty understanding the question. D-SNP lives in our Medicare book and pressure on what aspect of these D-SNP lives are you referring to?
Michael Ha: Yes. I guess if there's a six-month grace period on D-SNP lives and redetermination, and could that impact your visibility now? Could you see that come through later on? Or maybe am I not thinking about it correctly, if you give visibility onto it and clarity?
Joe Zubretsky: I can only comment on our D-SNP business. As you know, our Medicare business is performing well. A 4.5% pre-tax margin, we targeted six, 5.5% to six, but in this environment, we're pretty pleased with it. Demonstrations are doing well, D-SNP book is doing well, and as I said, we expanded our county footprint by 23%. We're really focusing on the dual eligible D-SNP population, and of course the Michigan win was huge. We have an MMP book that's going to convert to a fully integrated product here in 2026. So I can only comment that we're very bullish on the D-SNP population, we're focusing intensely on it. The final rule passed by CMS gives players with a substantial Medicaid footprint a huge advantage to take advantage of this great growth opportunity, and it's a profitable book to business for us. We have a proven track record of managing high-acuity lives effectively.
Michael Hall: Got it. Thank you. If I could follow up, in terms of favorable PYD, it seems like it's been pretty outsized, I think around 700 million this year, if that goes back to normal next year, I think it's about close to 100 bps of just MLR potential headwind into '25. So wondering if you have any color on how or where that could shake out next year, at least directionally, should we be thinking about this as returning to sort of more normal levels in '25?
Mark Keim: Well, Michael, thanks for the question, I'd start with what is normal, right? We are a bigger business in '24 than we were in '23, and yes, my PYD is bigger this year than it was last year, but we're a bigger business, we're getting better and better at things like payment integrity. And as you know, when we acquire businesses that also helps us when we look at prior year and prior period development, so I wouldn't say we're necessarily outsized this year, we're a growing business. Now, on a go-forward business, I'm not expecting any headwind from that area, it's part of the way we run our business. Remember, on medical cost management, there are many components to it, CM, UM, network contracting, payment integrity, and making sure that in retrospect, everything's got settled appropriately, avoiding fraud, waste, and abuse, that's a big part of our business. So I see the PYD item as a very continuing part of a business, and I wouldn't factor in anything meaningfully different next year.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Scott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. First question, just thought it might be helpful if you can maybe just sort of sequence us or walk us through on the corridors, where you stood at the beginning of the quarter, and then at the end of the quarter, and then where you're expecting to be, I guess, in terms of remaining cushion at the end of the year. Just trying to understand particularly how much potential, I guess, sort of cushion you'll still have from corridors heading into 2025?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, Scott, it's Joe. I'm going to make a framing comment and kick it to Mark for some color on the numbers, but the first thing, one of the reasons we usually hesitate to talk about corridors either in dollars or in basis points of cushion is you never know that you're going to be using it in a place where you have it. If you have negative trend experience, if it happens in a place where there's no corridor protection, there's zero protection, and if it happens everywhere we do have protection, it's 100% protected. So averages actually can be misleading, but I will tell you in each of the past four years we've been operating with about 200 basis points of protection at every point in time. Mark?
Mark Keim: Yes, and let me just run through the usual example that we give just to everyone's level set. If business reports an 88 MLR, in our case an analogy might be we were really running an 86. Again, this is just an example, and we were booking 200 basis points of corridor expense. Now, if during that example year the true underlying medical costs went from an 86 to an 87, you might still report the 88, you just would have used more corridor expense, just booked less corridor expense. When the new rate cycle comes around, if rates are actuarially sound, the rates will have to jump enough to essentially put that corridor position back to where it was, all things being equal. So the 86 underlying medical cost goes to an 87, the new rate trend knocks it back to an 86. Right now that is somewhat analogous to the overall enterprise. I started off the year thinking I had about 200 basis points of corridor expense in my MLR. As you know, over the quarters we've started to use that, and I've shown you that in my bridges, such that I'm thinking full year ultimate, that 200 that I normally have is down to more like 100 basis points within my MLR. Now, Joe talked about how 55% of our revenue reprices on January 1. We're optimistic on what that looks like, as well as the rate increases we got in Q3, Q4. So I'm expecting some extent to replenish that corridor. Now, that's all about the rate cycles, and we're not really ready to get into what's what on that. And the last thing, what Joe made, the points Joe made, is even with that 100 basis points of remaining corridor, it's an imperfect hedge, because it depends on where the medical costs come up and where you have the remaining corridors. So there's only so much comfort you can take in that, but it is a very big part of our equation. And again, just to round it out, 200 originally in my guidance, and I've probably used half of it during the course of the year.
Operator: And the last questioner today will be George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
George Hill: Yes, thanks for squeezing me in, guys. Mark, you might have just gotten us, but I guess, so the expectation is you have 100 basis points of the risk corridor to use in the back half of the year. I guess, can you talk about how much you expect to have by the end? And can you talk about how much was used front half versus back half?
Mark Keim: Okay. So it's best to think about these on a full year basis, because quarter-to-quarter, it gets a little bit more complicated. On a full year basis, I started off the year expecting 200. Across the year, a little bit in Q2, more in Q3, more in Q4, I expect to have used half of it, which means on a full year basis within my reported MLR, I'm expecting about 100 basis points of corridor expense. And again, for the New Year, it's all about the new rate cycle on what happens on resetting that.
George Hill: Okay, that's helpful. And if I could have a quick follow up, could you just comment on how many states do you guys still have a corridor position in? And what percent of lives are on a multi-year repricing basis? Like, we've spoken to some states where they just say, like, our rate cycle's two years or more than two years. So I know we talk about, like, the annual rate cycle, but there are just some states who don't do this annually. Maybe on a percentage of lives, can you talk about what states are on a multi-year cycle versus a single year cycle?
Mark Keim: Sure. Just about every one of our states has some form of a corridor, a minimum MLR, or a profit sharing. And that's not news. Many of these things have been around for quite some time. What is important is what the numbers are and how that acts. But you have some form of that in just about every state. And if I understood your question right on the pricing cycle, every state that we have reprices on an annual basis, and some of them commit to on a twice-a-year basis to look at the rates. Most years, that's not necessary, but obviously these days, that's an important fact.
George Hill: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question and answer session and Molina HealthCare's third quarter 2024 earnings call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-25 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day! And welcome to the Molina Healthcare Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference to Jeffrey Geyer, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jeffrey Geyer: Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare's second quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our second quarter 2024 earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those of you who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that, all of the remarks are made as of today, Thursday, July 25, 2024 and has not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. On this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the second quarter 2024 earnings release. During the call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to statements regarding our 2024 guidance, Medicaid redeterminations, expected Medicaid rate adjustments, medical cost initiatives, and our projected MCR, our recent RFP awards and related revenue growth, our acquisitions and M&A activity, our long-term growth strategy, and our embedded earnings power and future earnings realization. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K Annual Report filed with the SEC, as well as our risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe.
Joseph Zubretsky : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Today, we will provide you with updates on our reported financial results for the second quarter highlighted by $5.86 of earnings per share, which was in line with our expectations. An update on our full year 2024 guidance, which we reaffirm at $38 billion of premium revenue and at least $23.50 in earnings per share, and our growth initiatives and strategy for sustaining profitable growth. Let me start with our second quarter performance. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.86 a $9.4 billion of premium revenue. Our 88.6% consolidated MCR reflects disciplined medical cost management despite experiencing some modest medical cost pressure. We produced a 4.6% adjusted pre-tax margin or 3.5% after-tax, a very strong result that is in the middle of our long-term target range. Year-to-date, our consolidated MCR is also 88.6%, and our adjusted pre-tax margin is 4.5%, both within our long-term target ranges. Our well-balanced portfolio of businesses and focusing on managing medical costs continue to produce results in line with our expectations. In Medicaid, the business produced a second quarter MCR of 90.8%, above our long-term target range. This quarter included a one-time prior year retroactive premium item in our California business. Excluding this one-time item, the second quarter MCR was 90.1%, elevated by higher MCRs from our new store additions, a dynamic consistent with the first quarter. It also reflects slightly higher than expected medical costs in the legacy Medicaid portfolio, attributable to the ongoing acuity shift of redeterminations. We continue to have risk- corridor protection in many geographies and expect that this medical cost pressure will be adequately captured by known rate adjustments in the second half of 2024. We expect our Medicaid results to improve in the second half of the year. Several data points indicate we are well on track in this regard. First, the California retro rate item will not repeat. Second, our new store addition results will continue to improve as they did in the second quarter. Third, we received rates in many states for the second half of 2024 that were in line with first half developing cost trends. Approximately 35% of our Medicaid premium revenue renews in the second half. Combined with several off-cycle adjustments, these account for the expected legacy Medicaid MCR improvement through the remainder of the year. Then, with approximately 55% of our Medicaid premium revenue scheduled to renew on January 1, our rate cycle cadence is well timed for early 2025. Providing upside to our outlook for the balance of the year would be continued success with rate advocacy initiatives that could provide positive off-cycle rate adjustments. Turning to Medicare, our second quarter reported MCR was 84.9%, representing better than expected performance across all our Medicare products, primarily due to favorable risk adjustment results as well as benefit adjustments implemented for 2024. Our newly acquired Bright business in California is performing in line with expectations, and we remain confident in ultimately delivering the full one-rate accretion of $1 per share. Our strategy of leveraging our existing Medicaid footprint to serve high-acuity, low-income Medicare beneficiaries is working well. In Marketplace, the second quarter MCR was 71.6%. This business performed better than our expectations, even as we saw higher special enrollment period membership gains from redeterminations. Our mix of renewing members, prior year pricing actions, and improved risk adjustment results position us well to continue to profitably grow this book of business. Turning now to our guidance for the full year. We remain confident in delivering our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $23.50, or 13% year-over-year growth. Strong net investment income and known rates will offset the one-time retro premium item and the second quarter pressure experienced in Medicaid. Performance in our core business remains strong, and we expect second half improvements to be driven by known on and off-cycle rate increases and new store MCRs reverting to target. Our guidance also includes our Florida and Virginia contracts extending through year end. Our full year premium revenue remains unchanged at approximately $38 billion or 17% year-over-year growth. Our 2024 revenue and earnings per share guidance provide a strong foundation for profitable growth in 2025 and beyond, and the building blocks to get there remain intact. Now some comments on our growth initiatives. Our business is well positioned to capitalize on unique long-term growth opportunities in all three segments. First, a few comments on our recently announced acquisition of ConnectiCare from EmblemHealth. ConnectiCare currently serves approximately 140,000 members with $1.4 billion in annual premium revenue. This is a well-diversified government sponsored healthcare play, which serves primarily Marketplace and Medicare membership in Connecticut. Historically, our strategy has been to establish these core product lines only in our pre-existing Medicaid footprint to leverage our Medicaid infrastructure. While that option is not available to us in Connecticut, a Medicaid fee-for-service state, we believe this is a great opportunity to execute the time-tested Molina M&A playbook. Acquire a stable revenue stream in our core products, deploy capital efficiently, and improve the assets' performance in the proven and reliable Molina way. We expect this acquisition to provide earnings accretion of $1 in earnings per share, which is now added to our embedded earnings. Our M&A pipeline remains full of many actionable opportunities. In Medicaid, we remain confident in winning new and renewal business contracts. Some comments on recent developments. In Florida, we were recently awarded a contract that successfully retains our foothold in the state. We will retain our 52,000 Medicaid members in the Miami-Dade region. In addition, by agreement, we will grow to approximately 90,000 members through preferential auto assignment. We estimate the annual premium revenue of $500 million. In Wisconsin, we successfully defended our LTSS position as the state announced its intent to award Molina a contract to provide services in Region 5, the first of a series of regional reprocurements. Additionally, we were just re-awarded our sole contract position in the IRIS Self Directed Personal Care program. In Georgia, while we await the award announcement, we remain confident as to our prospects and believe that we are well positioned to serve that state's Medicaid population. Finally, there was significant market opportunity out for bid over the next three years. This includes the Texas STAR Kids RFP, which represents a meaningful opportunity in a state where we have demonstrated recent success. In Medicare, we remain sharply focused on further penetration of low-income, high-acuity dual-eligible populations and on our high-acuity MAPD population in California. The new CMS rules on Medicare and Medicaid integration position us well to attract dual-eligible members over the coming years, as our footprint combines both products in most of our states, enabling a fully integrated member experience. We are in the process of further developing our suite of integrated duals products, and we will soon be establishing a new dedicated organization to lead this effort. In Marketplace, we are positioned to grow organically in underpenetrated markets, given the stabilized risk profile and margins we've achieved. We believe our rate filings for 2025 make us very competitive in underpenetrated geographies and position us well to grow. As a reminder, our growth outlook in this business can be simply stated as grow at a rate that allows us to sustain mid-single digit pre-tax margins. We are confident in our ability to grow organically, win new state contracts, and execute our M&A strategy. These remain consistent pillars of our growth strategy, and we expect to meet our target of $46 billion of premium revenue in 2026. With our 2024 earnings per share guidance of at least $23.50 reaffirmed, and with our embedded earnings outlook of $5, we remain committed to delivering on our long-term earnings per share growth targets. As Mark will describe shortly, the building blocks to get there are intact. In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter 2024 financial performance. The Medicare and Marketplace businesses significantly outperformed, while Medicaid is on track to improve in the second half of the year through known rate increases and continuing new store MCR improvements. In the meantime, we continue to focus on executing on the fundamentals, which has been the hallmark of our financial performance. The unprecedented redetermination process, which will be a 24-month journey from beginning to end, has presented some challenges that we have successfully navigated. But nothing has occurred during this period that changes our view that these are attractive businesses for the near and long-term, and profitable growth can and will be sustained. In fact, our results demonstrate that the principle of rate soundness works in that Molina's unique rate corridor position protects against transient quarter-to-quarter fluctuations of rates and medical costs. Finally, we look forward to updating you on our outlook for sustaining profitable growth at an Investor Day event on Friday, November 8th in New York City. As in past years, we will provide you with our detailed playbook for achieving our growth targets and maintaining industry-leading margins. We will outline our long-term goals and how we will achieve them with the transparency and specificity that you have come to expect from us. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials.
Mark Keim : Thanks, Joe. And good morning, everyone. Today I'll discuss some additional details on our second quarter performance, the balance sheet, our 2024 guidance, and the building blocks of our 2025 EPS outlook. Beginning with our second quarter results. For the quarter, we reported approximately $10 billion in total revenue and $9.4 billion of premium revenue, with adjusted EPS of $5.86. Our second quarter consolidated MCR of 88.6%, was slightly above our expectations, but still on track to support our full year guidance. In Medicaid, our reported MCR was 90.8%. As Joe mentioned, this result includes a 70 basis point increase from a one-time retroactive premium adjustment in California related to the prior year. It is highly unusual for a state to retroactively reduce rates, and all of our known and expected future rate actions are positive as states address recent trends. Adjusting for this one-time prior year item, our reported MCR of 90.8% falls to 90.1%. Within that result, new store additions continue to run at a higher MCR, but lower than the first quarter and in line with our expectations. Recall, new store additions comprise almost 20% of our Medicaid segment this year. Adjusting for new store impact, our reported MCR falls another 80 basis points. We expect the MCR on this component to continue to decline over the coming quarters as these plans progress towards portfolio target margins. Excluding the one-time prior year item and the new store additions, our legacy Medicaid MCR was 89.3%, approximately 30 basis points above the top end of our long-term target range. We continue to experience the impact of redetermination related acuity shifts, a little more pronounced in the second quarter. Of course, Molina's strong performance in medical cost management means that in many states in recent years, we have typically been paying into minimum MLRs and corridors, an expense averaging 200 basis points within our reported MCR. As medical cost trend has modestly outpaced rates in the first and second quarters of the year, corridor expenses declined, largely shielding us from the temporary difference between rates and observed trend. We expect these corridor positions to be restored in coming quarters with our continuing medical cost discipline and the known and expected rate cycles. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, as Joe mentioned, we expect a number of items to drive the second half Medicaid MCR lower. For the first half of 2024, our reported Medicaid MCR was 90.2%. Our guidance includes the second half Medicaid MCR of 88.4%, a 180 basis point improvement driven by a few items. First, we reduced the second half expected MCR for the impact of this quarter's retro rate item, a benefit of 30 basis points to the second half Medicaid MCR compared to the first half. Second, new store additions, initially running higher than the legacy book, will continue to improve as they did in the second quarter as they approach portfolio target margins. New stores, a combination of new RFP wins and acquisitions, benefit from the execution of the Molina playbook quarter-over-quarter, and we expect 80 basis points of improvement to the second half Medicaid MCR compared to the first half. Third, the rate cycle of our state mix is well timed to return rates in line with the trend for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025. States are required to fund Medicaid MCOs with actuarially sound rates. Most states determine those rates based on demonstrated market trends and completed data rather than working hypotheses or speculation. As such, the higher trends most plans are seeing in the first and second quarters provides hard data for the rate setting process in coming months. We now have full visibility on higher final rates that offset observed trend representing approximately 35% of our revenue renewing in the second half of the year. In addition to the normal rate cycle, our rate advocacy efforts have already yielded positive off-cycle adjustments in four states that benefit the second half of the year. We are encouraged that several other states will follow this approach, although we do not include those in our guidance. Together, these known rate adjustments drive an expected benefit of 70 basis points to the second half Medicaid MCR when compared to the first half. Combining the first half reported MCR in our expectations for 180 basis point improvement in the second half as detailed results in full-year Medicaid guidance of 89.3% up from our previous guidance of 89%. This small increase in full-year Medicaid MCR guidance is almost entirely explained by this quarter's retro rate item. Also in Medicaid, a few comments on membership. While two of our states are continuing with redetermination in the third quarter, we are largely through the process. In the second quarter, we estimate a net loss of 100,000 Medicaid members through redetermination, taking the cumulative total to 650,000. Due to the timing of reconnects that will continue into the third and fourth quarters, our outlook for the ultimate total net loss of approximately 600,000 or 40% of the members gained is unchanged. Our full-year membership guidance remains at 5.1 million members. Conversions to marketplace remain strong as Medicaid members losing eligibility move to Molina marketplace products. In Medicare, our second quarter reported MCR with 84.9%. All Medicare products perform better than expected, driven by favorable risk adjustments and the benefit adjustments we implemented for 2024. Utilization in the quarter reflected consistent pressure from LTSS costs and pharmacy utilization. As Joe mentioned, the integration of the Bright business is on track to provide the projected ultimate $1 of earning accretion. In Marketplace, our second quarter reported MCR with 71.6%, better than expected. Despite higher special enrollment period membership year-to-date, we remain focused on growing this business while producing mid-single digit pre-tax margins. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 6.9%, as expected, and reflects operating discipline and the continued benefit of fixed-cause leverage as we grow our business. Turning to the balance sheet, our capital foundation remains strong. In the quarter, we harvested approximately $175 million of subsidiary dividends, and our parent company cash balance was approximately $235 million at the end of the quarter. Debt at the end of the quarter was unchanged and 1.4 times trailing 12-month EBITDA, with our debt-to-cap ratio at about 33%. These ratios reflect our low-leverage position and ample cash and capital capacity for additional growth and investment. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 50 and consistent with prior quarters. We remained confident in the strength of our reserves. Our operating cash flow for the first six months of 2024 was lower than prior year due to the timing of corridor payments, CMS receipts, as well as taxes. This year, we made several large corridor settlement payments related to prior periods. Next, a few comments on our 2024 guidance. As Joe mentioned, we reaffirm our full-year guidance with premium revenue of approximately $38 billion. We continued to expect full-year EPS of at least $23.50. Our EPS guidance now includes $0.65 of higher expected investment income as short-term rates are expected to hold up through the year, higher for longer, and $0.30 from the extension of the current Florida and Virginia contracts through 2024 year end. These items are offset by approximately $0.65 from the one-time retro premium adjustment and $0.30 due to Medicaid performance in the second quarter. Within our guidance, the full-year consolidated MCR increases slightly to 88.4% driven by the second quarter performance in Medicaid. As detailed, the full year Medicaid MCR is now expected to be approximately 89.3% up 30 basis points, primarily due to the second quarter one time item. Our MCR guidance on Medicare remains unchanged at 88% with strong, consistent year to date performance in our duals membership and the Bright acquisition. In Marketplace, we continue to expect the full year MCR to be 78% and at the low end of its long term target range while producing mid single digit pre-tax margins. Conversions to Marketplace due to Medicaid redeterminations are expected to continue into the second half of the year, while SEP growth typically comes with a higher MCR, we considered this in our 2024 guidance and the pricing of our 2025 bids. Turning to embedded earnings and the building blocks of our 2025 EPS outlook, our guidance on new store embedded earnings is now $5 per share, an increase from our prior outlook of $4. This increase reflects $1 from the ConnectiCare acquisition. We expect a little more than half of the new store embedded earnings to emerge in 2025 with the remainder in 2026. Finally, we see a clear path to achieve our EPS growth target heading into 2025. The building blocks include the embedded earnings we expect in 2025, the continuing organic growth and margin in our current footprint, and our in-flight organic and inorganic strategic initiatives. With 55% of our revenue renewing on January 1st of next year, our rate cycle is well timed for 2025. Even allowing for some headwinds from likely declining interest rates next year, the path is clear and compelling. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: Yes, thank you. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS.
A.J. Rice : Hi, everybody. Thanks for the question. Just maybe as a point of clarification. You're calling out risk adjustment true-up that's helped you both in public exchanges and in Medicare Advantage. Any way to size that and talk about how much of a positive variance it was relative to guidance? And then my other follow-up would be on the Medicaid side. Some of your peers, not all of them, but some are calling out that the legacy population they are left with seems to be having a little bit higher utilization than they had previously seen. It's not just deterioration on the risk pool related to redetermination. Have you seen any of that or is this what you are seeing in Medicaid, 100% related to just what's happening as a result of redetermination?
Mark Keim : Great. Hey, good morning, A.J. I'll take the first one and Joe will pick up the second one. On risk adjustment, let's touch on Marketplace and Medicare. On Marketplace, some of you have seen from the CMS files, we recognize about $20 million of additional risk adjustment benefit from the prior year between first and second quarter. Remember, we have insights on the development of that through the weekly service and other things, but across the first half, about $20 million from the prior year. So, first half revenue is about $1.2 billion. You do the math, a little bit less than 20 basis points in our first half, first and second quarter MLRs for Marketplace. Just for reference, it was about the same a year ago. So the year-over-year as compared, it's about the same, about 20 basis points of benefit.
Joseph Zubretsky : A.J. on your second question related to – I'm sorry. Please, go ahead.
A.J. Rice : Just on the...
Joseph Zubretsky: Say it again A.J. A.J., I think we lost you, but let me take your second question related to medical cost trends in the business. In Medicaid, as always, you see pockets of utilization increases in various geographies and in various healthcare categories. We see some pockets of skilled nursing facility cost increases, hours in home-based care. BH is spiking in a couple of geographies, but nothing we've never seen before. Pharmacy trend to high-cost drugs in the GLP-1s, certainly putting some cost pressure on the system. But again, nothing out of the ordinary and nothing that can't be dealt with, particularly as our corridor position absorbs these trends and then rates kick in to pick up the slack.
A.J. Rice : Okay, thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Andrew Mok with Barclays.
Andrew Mok : Hi, good morning. Just a question on the underlying Medicaid pressure in the same-store portfolio. I don't remember you calling out pressure in Q1, but it sounds like that may have developed slightly worse. Is that correct? And can you clarify when core Medicaid pressure started to materialize this year? Thanks.
Mark Keim: Sure, you are right. We saw a little bit more pressure in the legacy book in the second quarter versus the first quarter, and one of the drivers is just simply membership. You might recall, in the first quarter we noticed that we lost about 50,000 members due to redetermination. We were a little more than that in the second quarter at about 100,000. Just to round that out, we're currently at 650,000 total cumulative, and we expect to get back about 50,000 in the rest of the year through reconnects. So the volume, the membership up a little bit in the second quarter. I don't doubt that drove a lot of the higher legacy impacts we saw.
Andrew Mok : Got it. But did Q1 also come in worse than what you had expected when you actually saw the claims?
Joseph Zubretsky: It was a little bit higher than normal, but not worse than we expected in the first quarter.
Andrew Mok : Okay. And then secondly, it sounds like you are describing a more modest pressure relative to peers. So I just wanted to better understand that experience. How much pressure was offset by the risk corridor buffer? And do you see modest pressure across most states or concentrated pressure in a few states? Thanks.
Joseph Zubretsky: The pressure is isolated. It's various healthcare cost categories in various of our individual health plans. And Mark covered this in his prepared remarks. Sometimes it's overlooked. We've been routinely over the past four years, paying into the risk corridors at minimum MLRs to the extent of about 200 basis points inside our NCR, which basically means if you are reporting an 88, you are performing at an 86, which gives you 200 basis points of cushion if a medical cost should inflect for any reason, whether it's an acuity shift or whether it's normal trend. So we see pockets of utilization increases as I described, in various categories, in various plans, but largely picked up by the corridors and mid-cycle rate increases and on-cycle rate increases, particularly in the second half of the year where 35% of our revenue renews in the second half.
Andrew Mok : Great. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Ryan Langston with TD Cowen.
Ryan Langston : Hey, good morning. Following up on Medicaid, we've heard some commentary just from some peers that there's this pull-through effect when folks are receiving their enrollment loss information and then they might be utilizing more services before they actually use it. I guess, are you seeing that same kind of experience? And then maybe further, do you have any sense of what the utilization profile actually looks like for folks who actually are able to re-enroll once being redetermined off? Is that any different than sort of the normal population? Thanks.
Joseph Zubretsky: We've heard the discussion about over-utilizing in advance of losing coverage. We have not experienced that. Our leavers are leaving at the same MCR from the beginning of the redetermination process to the end. No change and no indication that they are using services in advance particularly, because in the termination process, many of them don't know that they've been redetermined. So they don't have any advance notice. They are just off the Medicaid rolls. They weren't using services and now they are off through the redetermination process. So we haven't seen that.
Mark Keim: Ryan, I’ll just build on that. What we've been citing and what many others are seeing, is that of the folks that get redetermined, they lose their eligibility, 70% are for procedural reasons. That means they just didn't fill out the paperwork or weren't aware. So that certainly argues against any kind of last minute usage, when in fact they weren't aware they were losing coverage. I think you also asked about the reconnects, when they come back in. Yes, very often for the first month we'll see a little bit of higher utilization. And think about it, somebody lost their eligibility. They might not know they lost it until two or three months later when they go to the drug store to fill out a script. At that point they are utilizing and that first month might be a little bit higher. But typically they are going to quickly resolve to the portfolio average. So we're not seeing any meaningful impact there.
Ryan Langston : Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.
Josh Raskin : Hi! Thanks. Just a clarification on the margin side of the Medicaid book. So could you just tell us what your Medicaid margins were in 1Q versus 2Q and what's embedded in guidance for the second half? And then my bigger question is just, the commercial MLR last year, exchanges were 75%. I think you said 78% MLR this year. It looks like you are tracking probably favorable to that. So how are you thinking about the potential for rebates next year? And should we be thinking about a strategy of reducing price to get higher membership for 2025?
Joseph Zubretsky: I'll take the last part of that first Josh on marketplace. Clearly running at 72 for the first half and predicting 78 for the back half seems to be a push. But be mindful of the fact that SEP membership is quite high and those members are coming in at higher utilization rates than the existing membership. And then of course you have the natural seasonality of the business. Now, you are absolutely right. Last year, we actually invested margin in growth and we grew at $1 billion to $1.2 billion of revenue this year. Where we're running this year, we think we're at par. We think we're right in the single-digit land, but we could. You could see us be a little more aggressive on growth next year and try to grow this business as we did in 2024 over ‘23. So the margin position is solid. And again, our growth rate is going to be determined by our ability to produce mid-single-digit margins, just given the inherent volatility that exists in the business itself.
Mark Keim:  Great, and I'll go ahead and take the second one. Josh, per our reported results, as you know, the MCR in the first quarter on Medicaid was an 89.7. We reported a 90.8. Across the first half of the year, that's an average of a 90.2. We're tracking to an 89.3 for the full year, and I gave you the walk in my prepared remarks of how the second half supports that. We have great confidence in those three building blocks that support that. Now the 89.3 for the full year guidance is up from 89. The last time we were together, so we've raised the full year guidance by 30 bips. Two-thirds of that was just recognizing that one-time California item we had to jump over in the second quarter. So the rest is just a little bit of pressure from the second quarter legacy business, otherwise very much on track for an 89.3 full year.
Josh Raskin : Okay, so target margin, but this year not terribly off from target margins, right? Sort of towards the lower end maybe of the turn. Okay, perfect.
Joseph Zubretsky: Correct, and I think there'll be enough strength that we pointed out otherwise in the business to more than overcome that 30-bip increase. So I think we're in good shape.
Josh Raskin : Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.
Kevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. I guess we're having a hard time kind of reconciling your view about where MLR is in Medicaid versus what a lot of your peers are doing. So I guess, your comment seems to be that your risk corridors are allowing you to kind of offset a lot of this pressure. Can you give us a sense of on a gross basis then what’s the MLR pressure? Are you saying you had 200 basis points of risk corridor and now it's only 100? And then there's another 10 or 20 in the core net because of payables not completely matching everything. Like just kind of size it for us. It seems like everybody else seems to be saying somewhere between 100 and 150 basis points of MLR pressure and just to hear 10 or 20 in the core, it’s hard to reconcile. And then, I guess you mentioned you expect people to be coming back as the year goes on. Shouldn't that be a pressure on MLR in the back half of the year? It didn't seem like you were building anything in for rejoiners putting up a pressure on MLR in your bridge from one half to two half. Thanks.
Joseph Zubretsky: Well, Mark gave you the numbers in the prepared remarks that are actual in the last four years. We have been paying in to the corridors to the extent of 200 basis points, contributing to the Medicaid MCR, 200 basis points. We said at the beginning of the redetermination process, we said this repeatedly, that the corridors were going to act as a financial buffer until such times rates pick up the slack, which is exactly what's happening. So yes, suffice it to say, this year our corridor liability isn't 200 basis points. We've used some of it to cushion the results, but some of it does remain in various geographies in a meaningful way. Now, the other point to make on the corridors is they don't just disappear forever. They replenish at the next rate cycle, whatever the state fiscal year is. And so if you could actually sound rates at the next rate cycle and you continue to relatively outperform that benchmark, you are back into the corridors and you are recreating that 200 basis points of cushion.
Mark Keim: And Kevin, just a couple more thoughts. Since our last guidance in the first quarter, we probably see trend across our business for the year, up 150 basis points, 1.5% higher trend than we thought before. That's capturing what we saw in the second quarter and what we're expecting for the third and fourth. And of course, to your point, that includes the dynamic for the rejoiners and just as importantly what we're actually jumping off in the second quarter. So we're seeing a higher trend than we previously thought of 1.5%. Now, as we detailed, we've got known rate adjustments in the second half, both on cycle and off cycle, which defray about 1% across the full year of that trend. The other 50 bips is picked up by corridors. So we feel pretty insulated from a higher trend here, both on known rates and as Joe mentioned, this very important corridor dynamic we bring to the table. So yeah, we've been carrying 200 bips over the last couple of years within our reported MCR. It'll be lower this year, but that'll be a function of actual rates and the ultimate trend.
Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.
Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. First, it looked like your PYD benefit to MLR was almost 200 basis points in the quarter. I'm curious if you could share with us whether that was evenly spread among the three segments or was balanced in one or two specifically. And then Joe, can you talk to us a little bit about exchanges, a lot of focus going into the elections. What's your early view on, if the subsidies aren't extended, the enhanced subsidies I should say. If they aren't extended at the end of 2025, what do you think happens to the exchange population in general?
Joseph Zubretsky: On the PYD point -- I'll kick it to Mark, but the first point to make before which lines of business did it affect. Most of it, if not nearly all of it, was picked up by prior year corridors. Mark, do you want to take it?
Mark Keim: Right. So Justin, your question is, yes, it's a little bit bigger than we've seen in the past, but we're a bigger business than we've been in the past. A lot of this stems from our payment integrity business, which reaches back into prior years to make sure that fraud, waste and abuse, things like that are addressed. So it's a little bit bigger. Of course, Medicaid and Medicare is where you expect to see it mostly, and that's what you'll see in the Q when it comes out. A little bit in marketplace, but most of it was in Medicaid and Medicare. As Joe mentioned, it really isn't a good guy this year, because we were big time corridor payers last year, and of course the prior year development goes to last year's corridors, so most of that got caught up in prior year corridors.
Joseph Zubretsky: And your question related to the exchanges, everybody's got models. We see models in the industry. We have our own models in terms of what would happen if the enhanced subsidies are in fact, do expire. And there's industry estimates we have our own. You look at the level of subsidies, you look at your FPL cohorts, and you can argue that 10%, 20% of membership could be affected and priced out of your silver product, but then again, you have a lower priced bronze product, perhaps sitting right next to it. So how many of those are going to recapture into one of your bronze products, a little priced hard to say. But we've seen industry estimates of 10% to 20%, and then the wild card is if you have a bronze product sitting alongside your silver product in a certain geography, will you recapture some of that in bronze?
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.
Stephen Baxter : Hi, thanks. Just a couple of follow-ups on the Medicaid discussion. I guess, can you provide us specifically the first half number that's comparable to the 200 basis points of the typical corridor expense that you cite? And then can you also update us on what percentage of your premiums have some level of protection here versus your more directly exposed to whatever the underlying performance in the Medicaid book is? And then just trying to understand the rate update process. I think you suggested, obviously the states want to operate on hard data and not theories. But it does seem like a lot of this deterioration is happening in the second quarter, which is not fully developed at this point. So is this largely because maybe the acuity adjustment compensated the lower level of disenrollment [inaudible] your conversation? I'm just trying to understand why the states would be compelled to act, kind of on a more recently developing trend. Thanks.
Mark Keim: Hey Stephen, it's Mark. There's a lot to unpack there. Can you start with the first one? I want to make sure I understand it.
Stephen Baxter : Yes. The 200 basis points of typical corridor expense that you cite, I would just like to know specifically in the first half of the year if you could give us a comparable metric there. And then when we think about the percentage of your Medicaid premiums that have some level of protection from those corridors versus are more directly exposed to the underlying performance of the business, like is it 50%, is it 75%? How should we think about that?
Mark Keim: Sure. Now, the way to think about corridors, in prior years, roughly 200 was usually embedded in our reported MCR. Corridors track to an ultimate across the full year. So you don't really know until the year is over where you come out, and again, that's going to be a function of rate and trend. But what I can tell you is in the first half, I think about half of that normal rate was within our number if we look at what's happened and our expected ultimates. So we're definitely using some of it year-to-date. And as we mentioned in our remarks here, we're expecting to use some of it in the rest of the year. So think across the full year, roughly half of that normal run rate number.
Joseph Zubretsky: And Stephen, we have very detailed models. We have an entire accounting system on NIM and MLR and corridor tracking. And one of the reasons we don't give specific numbers generally is if 50% or 75% of your premium has a corridor, you say, well, it's protected. Well, it's only protected if that's where the medical cost deterioration happens. And so looking at the gross number can just be very, very misleading. We have our arms around it. We know where we're protected. We know where we have upside opportunity and some geographies there's upside opportunity depending on where you are in the corridor. So we generally don't like to give specific numbers on how much premium is protected, because I think it gives a false positive.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Sarah James : Thank you. I appreciate you reiterating the 2026 premium guidance. I was hoping that you could refresh the bridge a little bit. When you laid it out at I-Day [ph] off of the 23 base, you were talking about $4.5 billion of M&A and $2.5 billion of strategic initiatives. Is that still the mix that you see? And then when you think about M&A, how do you think about the mix between Medicaid and exchange that could play out through 2026 or that exists in your pipeline?
Joseph Zubretsky: It is possible that if we're redoing that projection right now, it would have to be a little more influenced by M&A, just given where we are in the reprocurement cycle, but we're very active in the M&A space as we just demonstrated. Yeah, comments have been made that the last two transactions that we executed were Medicare and marketplace, which some people are calling non-core. They are core. They are as core as Medicaid. And our pipeline is still very active with Medicaid opportunities, and you'll hopefully see Medicaid transactions here over the next 12 to 18 months. We're still very active in that space. The last two we did were non-Medicaid, but that doesn't mean we're not actively pursuing them and working them.
Sarah James : Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Hall with Baird.
Michael Hall : All right, thank you. So a quick clarification and then my real question. I was surprised to see no cash flow from Ops so far, first half of the year. I know you called out special timing, corridor payments, CMS receipts, etc. I was wondering if you could break out some of the amounts of the larger pieces to help bridge us back to what maybe normalized cash flow from Ops would look like. And then the real question on MA risk adjustment benefit. Wondering if you could just – how much specifically did you benefit from it for your 2Q MA MLR? And generally, isn’t it true that, yes, the risk adjustment fleets tend to result in some slight favorability, but also from my understanding, plans generally don't see a huge benefit, because they simply accrue to whatever the risk adjustment was in their early 1Q payments. So my question is, how did you recognize such a large benefit? Was there something unique going on with BrightHealth's MA assets where maybe you took a more conservative approach on the risk adjustment accrual? So more color on that would be great. Thank you.
Mark Keim: Hey, Michael. Good morning. It's Mark. Let me take OCF. As we mentioned, and for everybody's benefit, Michael's asking about a large difference in this year's first six months operating cash flow versus prior years. Just a note on that, I think some people forget that government services MCOs have a lot lumpier cash flow than maybe some of our diversified competitors. Commercial businesses tend to have much more stable quarter-to-quarter OCF as do services businesses. Government businesses, because of the timing of large payments, risk adjustment and corridors will be a little bit lumpier. The only other comment I'll make, and I'll get into the details Michael, is we are a growing business, and a growing business should always have OCF ahead of net investment income, because a growing business, that's the way the working capital cycle works, and we do. If you look at any broader time frame, you will see that. So the first half is really about a couple of unique items, unique items that benefited us last year and are now just sort of catching up. So there's three that we'll talk about and you'll see these on my operating cash flow in the earnings release. The largest one is the timing of risk corridor payments. Here's how to think about this. We're accruing less this year on risk corridors than we were last year for all the reasons Joe and I just discussed. But separately, I'm paying down last year's balances. So that's a big swing in OCF, call it a little more than $0.5 billion. Next one is CMS payments. You know it's funny, CMS payments usually come in a couple of days before the end of the quarter or a couple of days after the end of the quarter, and that makes a big difference on the reported cash flow. About 400 of our OCF swing is exactly that, and you'll see that on the operating cash flow statement. And the last one's a little bit unique. We had about $200 million of cash flow benefit year-over-year from California taxes. You might recall that California federal taxpayers got a little bit of a delay on their tax due dates back in 2023. So both, the 2022 final tax payments, as well as the estimated 2023 tax payments were delayed into the second half of the year. This year, we're right back on target. So year-over-year, that's a bad guy. This year, it was a good guy last year. That's $200 million right there. So I probably just walked you through the vast majority of that operating cash flow deficit you are talking about. We're very comfortable in the cash flow characteristics of the business. And again, look over any broader period of time, you'll see a great normalization in that relationship between OCF and net income. On the Medicare risk adjustment, a couple of comments there. Unlike Marketplace, most of that Medicare was a benefit from this year's operations, and gosh, we're just getting a little bit better at it. We've got a bigger business. We've got the bright business, and sure, there's always some prior year benefit. But a lot of this is, we're just getting better at the risk adjustment equation across each of our individual Medicare businesses.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens.
Scott Fidel : Hi, thanks. Actually, just to follow-up, I guess to sort of complete out the operating cash flow discussion. Mark, can you give us what you are expecting for the back half of 2024 or for the full year for CFFO? And then second, I guess main question would be, definitely thought it would be helpful maybe if you just want to segment or bucket the dollar of embedded earnings that you're expecting from Connecticare in terms of what sort of the key drivers of that accretion to get to the dollar bill. Thanks.
Mark Keim: Sure. On the second half of OCF, a normal relationship is a little bit ahead of net income. So, think a relationship of 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, something like that. I would expect a more normalized relationship in the second half of the year. Again, looking over the two years in total, so much of that year-over-year comparison was about things unique to last year or unique to this year. Looking at ‘23, ‘24 combined, you'll get a very normal relationship between OCF and net income that'll certainly normalize in the second half of this year.
Joseph Zubretsky: And Scott, on the Connecticare acquisition, the business performs okay. It does not perform to Molina target margins. As typical in these situations, we intend to improve the MCRs in both, the marketplace business and the Medicare business, and rationalize the G&A spend. It is not a huge undertaking. As I said, they are underperforming our targets, but not woefully underperforming. We will improve the performance by moving these simply from where they are to Molina targets. Pay per membership, good brand recognition. We bought it at 25% of revenue, half of which is hard capital. And then we unleashed the Molina playbook to get it to our target margins, the dollar of accretion. Great deal for us.
Scott Fidel : Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the last question this morning comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.
George Hill : Hey, good morning guys. And thanks for sneaking me in. I hope I have two quick ones here. I guess you talked about the example where you have acuity getting worse and states are cutting rates. Well I guess, talk to us about how confident you'll be that you'll kind of get rate in that percentage of the book going forward. Just increasingly as we're hearing like, we hear about actuarial soundness, but when we talk to some state regulators, we hear actual soundness is kind of with the phrase, ‘subject to budget.’ So kind of worried about the timing and the mismatch there. And then on the 200 basis points in the risk quarter that we discussed, I guess, can you talk about your confidence in the risk quarter, like the contributions. It'll suck up some utilization in the back half of this year, but I guess, can you talk about like how much was sucked up in Q2 and like how should we think about like the risk quarter – the decrease in risk quarter contributions in Q2 and kind of how that varies through the back half of the year? Thank you.
Mark Keim: Sure. A couple of things there. So you are mentioning the California negative retro rate adjustment. Look, I haven't personally seen one. That's the only one. I don't expect another one, but for the rest of the year, there's not speculation. Those rate increases that Joe and I talked about in the second half of the year, both the normal rate cycle and the off cycle rates, all of those are known and committed, so not a lot of speculation there. On the 200 basis points that you are talking about of historical, you can't really think about corridors on a quarterly basis, because they are an annual fiscal year concept. So you are always accruing to an ultimate, which means you are spreading out any impact across all four quarters, not quarter specific. So when I think about the full year and our fiscal year accounting, we said somewhere around half of the historical 200 is about what we think we're using. That's again a guess, and it will ultimately come down to the full year development of rates, trends, and our medical management.
A - Joseph Zubretsky: And George, maybe it's best to give a couple of examples. So we have Texas is a September 1 renewal. Things were running a little hot in Texas. Acuity shift, etc. We had a high – the market got a high single digit rate increase. That will have impact to the second year, it's known. We have it in draft form. Draft rates never decline. They can go up, but we're very confident in it. Another example is a really interesting one. It actually explains some of the trend inflection we talked about that's very localized, and the rate actions that are taken in Kentucky. Due to the pandemic, the regulators asked the market to suspend UM on outpatient behavioral. We did, as did the market. What happens? Cost goes up. The market then approaches the state, presents the actual data, mid cycle rate increase because the behavioral program was underfunded. So the conversations with our state regulators, our customer are very productive. They are databased, and they are taking very reasonable positions, whether something is program related or whether it's an acuity shift that can be actually supported.
George Hill : Helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes both the questions session as well as the event itself. Thank you so much for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-25 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Molina Healthcare First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Jeffrey Geyer. Please go ahead. 
Jeffrey Geyer: Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our first quarter 2024 earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those of you who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that all of the remarks are made as of today, Thursday, April 25, 2024, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. 
 On this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the first quarter 2024 earnings release. During the call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our 2024 guidance, Medicaid redeterminations, our recent RFP awards and related revenue growth, our recent acquisitions and M&A activity, our long-term growth strategy, our embedded earnings power and future earnings realization and our Medicare business performance in 2025. 
 Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors, discussed in our Form 10-K annual report filed with the SEC as well as our risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe? 
Joseph Zubretsky: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Today, I will cover our traditional quarterly topics, our reported financial results for the first quarter, which were in line with our expectations, highlighted by $5.73 of earnings per share. An update on our guidance, which we reaffirm at $38 billion of premium revenue and at least $23.50 in earnings per share and an update on our growth initiatives, which in the quarter were mixed, but we are maintaining our $4 per share estimate of embedded earnings and our long-term growth outlook. 
 Let me start with our first quarter performance. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.73, a $9.5 billion of premium revenue, supported by excellent operating metrics across all lines of business. Our 88.5% consolidated MCR reflects continued strong medical cost management with all 3 segments reporting MCRs, in line with our expectations. We produced a 4.5% adjusted pretax margin or 3.4% after tax, a very strong result that is in the middle of our long-term target range. 
 In Medicaid, we continue to deliver strong operating margins while growing our franchise as the business produced a first quarter MCR of 89.7%. Our expanded platform in California and our new Nebraska health plan, together, added over 0.5 million members and along with our new store additions in late 2023, drove an increase in the MCR above our long-term target range, but in line with our quarterly expectations. We believe we have now experienced approximately 90% of the Medicaid redetermination impact. 
 The acuity shift unfolded as we predicted and appears to have stabilized in most of our markets. Rate changes, both on cycle and off-cycle largely offset the security shift with risk corridors capturing any temporary shortfall. Medicaid rates remain actuarially sound with 19 states that represent over 95% of our revenue, providing acuity-related rate adjustments within 2024. Turning to Medicare. Our first quarter reported MCR was 88.7%, our performance in line with our expectations. The higher utilization we experienced in the second half of 2023 due to higher LTSS costs and pharmacy utilization continued into 2024. But the operational improvements and supplemental benefit adjustments to be made in our legacy business have thus far proven to be successful. 
 Our first quarter experience of the newly acquired Bright Medicare plans provides us with confidence in our turnaround plan to deliver the embedded earnings. Our strategy of leveraging our existing Medicaid footprint to serve high acuity, low-income Medicare beneficiaries is working well. In Marketplace, the first quarter MCR was 73.3% and in line with our expectations. 
 Our membership mix comprised 50% renewal members and 70% of members in our silver product. Strong renewals gives us keen insight into the acuity of our membership base. We continue to expect this business to grow throughout the year as the Medicaid redetermination process provides a great opportunity to capture membership during the special enrollment period. Turning now to our guidance for the full year. Based on our consolidated first quarter results, we reaffirm our full year 2024 adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $23.50 or 13% year-over-year growth. Our full year premium revenue remains unchanged at approximately $38 billion or 17% year-over-year growth. 
 While we are seeing increased underlying strength in our core business, we are maintaining our full year guidance to account for any potential earnings headwind in the second half of the year from potential contract losses in Virginia and Florida. Our 2024 revenue and EPS guidance provides a strong foundation for profitable growth in 2025 and beyond. Now some comments on our growth initiatives. In Medicaid, we had mixed success in the quarter. We were awarded a large RFP win in Texas and a large reprocurement win in Michigan, but we're not awarded contracts in 2 other existing states, Virginia and Florida. All these impacts combined caused no net change to our embedded earnings, which remains at $4 per share. 
 Let me provide some commentary on these RFP outcomes. In Texas, the state announced its intent to award us all 7 of our preferred service areas as part of the STAR and CHIP programs. This contract is expected to begin in September 2025 and last for 6 years with the option to extend up to an additional 6 years. The award expands our footprint and increases our market share. We successfully defended our position in Michigan and were awarded a contract in 6 regions. While these regions represent 93% of our current membership, the award reduced the number of payers in many of our retained regions and thus, we expect to grow our market share. 
 We were very disappointed with the outcome in the Virginia RFP, but we are exercising our right to challenge this decision. We were also disappointed with the RFP result in Florida, but history has shown that the ultimate outcome there could be more favorable. We will continue to refine our membership, revenue and embedded earnings estimates as we gain clarity on the new contracts, our expanding market share and the unwinding of any lost revenue. Now with respect to future growth initiatives, our growth pipeline remains replete with opportunity. 
 Regarding RFPs, many opportunities remain with over $60 billion of premium opportunity up for bid over the next 3 years. This includes in-flight RFP bids in 2 states, Kansas and Georgia, and a projected near-term RFP in North Carolina. The Texas STAR Kids program is likely going to RFP soon, where we now have a very strong statewide presence and great momentum. We remain confident in our ability to win new state contracts and deliver clinical and financial outcomes that align with the needs of our state partners. Although this quarter's RFP results were mixed, since we began our growth strategy, we are 7 for 9 in reprocurements and 8 for 10 in new business procurements. This track record gives us great confidence in our strategy and our continued ability to drive growth. 
 With respect to M&A initiatives, our acquisition pipeline contains many actionable opportunities. We have executed 8 transactions totaling $11 billion in revenue over the past 4 years, and M&A will continue to be a key component of our strategy. Next, as we look forward into 2025, 2 comments about the outlook for our Medicare portfolio. First, our Medicare product profile has different characteristics than mainstream MAPD business. Our business is a combination of legacy D-SNP, MNP demonstrations and our newly acquired Bright business. With this lineup of products, factors such as rate setting, bidding and revenue drivers do matter, but to a lesser extent. 
 Second, the product portfolio is well positioned to contribute to our growth. Our penetration in dual eligible populations, high acuity and dual income will benefit from further integration of Medicare and Medicaid benefits. BMS recently announced rules to closely align dual-eligible populations with Medicaid MCOs, which means our Medicaid footprint will be a growth catalyst for attracting and retaining dual-eligible membership. 
 With our 2024 guidance reaffirmed, we remain committed to delivering on our long-term premium and earnings per share growth earnings. With all of the successful growth activity in M&A in new and expanded contracts, even considering the potential for contract losses or reductions, we maintain our embedded earnings outlook at $4 per share. Mark will provide insight on the components in a moment, but the majority is still expected to emerge in 2025. 
 In summary, we are very pleased with our first quarter 2024 financial and operating performance. That performance, combined with our successful track record for producing top line revenue keeps us on track for sustaining profitable growth consistent with our long-term targets. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark? 
Mark Keim: Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss additional details on our first quarter performance, the balance sheet, our 2024 guidance and thoughts on embedded earnings. Beginning with our first quarter results. For the quarter, we reported approximately $10 billion in total revenue and $9.5 billion of premium revenue with adjusted EPS of $5.73. Our first quarter consolidated MCR was 88.5% and reflect continued strong medical cost management. 
 The change health care outage did not materially impact quarterly results, and all of our segments reported MCRs in line with our expectations. In Medicaid, our first quarter reported MCR was 89.7% as expected, the new store additions in California and Nebraska as well as Iowa and the My Choice Wisconsin acquisition in late 2023 drove a higher reported MCR in the first quarter. Recall, we have added approximately 800,000 Medicaid members in the past 3 quarters, and these new store members typically experience higher MLRs in the early stages. 
 Across our Medicaid business, the major medical cost categories were largely in line with our expectations and the normal quarter-to-quarter trend of fluctuations within our guidance. In Medicare, our first quarter reported MCR was 88.7%, in line with our expectations. Higher LTSS costs and pharmacy utilization continued in our legacy business but were somewhat offset by the operational improvements and benefit adjustments that we implemented for 2024. 
 Segment results now include the newly acquired Bright plans with initial performance as expected. In Marketplace, our first quarter reported MCR was 73.3%, and we are pleased with the high renewal rates and significant silver membership composition. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 7.1%, as expected, reflecting operating discipline and the continued benefit of fixed cost leverage as we grow our business. Moving on to Medicaid redeterminations. In the quarter, we estimated a net loss of 50,000 members due to redeterminations. This was on track with our expectations and brings the total net loss from redetermination since its inception to 550,000. 
 We estimate that our membership is approximately 90% of the way through the redetermination process. We expect to lose another 50,000 members in the second quarter, the last quarter of pandemic-related redeterminations to reach our total estimated net loss of 600,000. Our reconnect rate was 30%. We expect this rate to remain near 30% in the second quarter. And of course, some of the reconnect benefit will continue into the third quarter and beyond. We continue to see strong marketplace SEP membership growth as Medicaid members losing eligibility moved to Molina Marketplace products. 
 Turning to our balance sheet. Our capital foundation remains strong. On January 1, we closed the Bright acquisition at a final price of approximately $425 million, funded with cash on hand. In the quarter, we harvested approximately $110 million of subsidiary dividends, bringing our parent company cash balance to $194 million at the end of the quarter. Debt at the end of the quarter was unchanged and 1.4x trailing 12-month EBITDA with our debt-to-cap ratio at about 35%. 
 These ratios reflect our low leverage position and ample cash and capital capacity for additional growth and investment. In the quarter, both S&P and Moody's upgraded our credit ratings based on our low debt, stable earnings profile and high transparency. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 49% and consistent with prior quarters. While the Change Healthcare outage impacted our February operations with claims 20% lower than normal, we're pleased to report that our quick response through alternative clearing houses restored claims and payments to near normal levels in March. 
 Given the mid-quarter disruption, we have been appropriately prudent and are confident in the strength of our reserve position. Next, a few comments on our 2024 guidance. As Joe mentioned, we reaffirm our full year guidance with premium revenue of approximately $38 billion. Our revenue guidance remains unchanged as we work with state partners to understand the timing and impact of any contract losses in Virginia and Florida. Our full year consolidated MCR is unchanged at 88.2%. Medical cost trends are in line with expectations across all businesses, and we remain appropriately conservative in our outlook on utilization and acuity trends at this stage in the year. 
 We continue to expect full year EPS of at least $23.50 per share. We see underlying strength in our core business. However, we are maintaining our full year guidance of recognizing any potential earnings headwinds in the second half of the year from potential contract losses in Virginia and Florida. Looking ahead to 2025, a few observations on our Medicare portfolio. The CMS final rate notice for Medicare Advantage has received a lot of attention. For Molina, it's important to note that only 2/3 of our Medicare segment revenue or only 10% of total enterprise revenue is fully subject to these rates. With a heavy concentration in California, we yielded a more favorable rate profile than CMS national averages. The remaining 1/3 of our Medicare segment, the MMP demonstrations received rates determined by CMS and our state partners, which continue to be appropriately commensurate with cost trends. 
 We remain confident that the rate environment and our product profile will position us to grow our Medicare business profitably. The integration of our recent Bright acquisition is off to a great start. Recall that we are expecting modest dilution from Bright this year. We expect an improvement to break even in 2025 and then full run rate accretion of $1 EPS in 2026. Looking at our Medicare segment from a different perspective. 
 As Joe mentioned earlier, we believe that the recent CMS 2025 final role, strategically advantaged us to grow. Currently, many dual eligible members received their medicated Medicare benefits from 2 different MCOs. CMS announced rules that will move these unaligned dual members to the D-SNP plan run by their Medicaid MCO. As such, incumbent Medicaid players will see increased growth opportunities in D-SNP. While the new rule will phase in over time, it's clear that our substantial Medicaid footprint positions us well to grow our D-SNP product to serve due eligible members. This shift, along with demand from state partners to service these complex populations gives us confidence, our Medicare portfolio will meet our long-term growth and margin targets. 
 Turning to embedded earnings. We continue to guide to $4 of new store embedded earnings as we now expect approximately $0.80 from the new contract win in Texas incepting next year to be offset by our best estimate of next year's impact of the Virginia and Florida potential losses. We expect the majority of this new store embedded earnings to emerge in 2025 with the remainder in 2026. giving us further confidence in our 15% to 18% long-term growth rate for EPS. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from Kyle Sternick with JPMorgan. 
Kyle Kristick: I guess, first, I wanted to start on the guidance here, is -- you talked about the strength in the core business and the MCR sort of being in line with your expectations. So I guess, is the right way to think that the strength is really coming from G&A? And then when we think about the back half is -- I guess, is the outperformance in the current business enough to allow you to maintain guidance? Or if you think about the -- those potential contracts going away, are there additional SG&A savings you'd need to target in the back half to be able to offset those losses? Just any color to help us frame that would be great. 
Joseph Zubretsky: Okay. We are clearly saying that if we have a revenue loss in the third and fourth quarters due to the contract losses and the related earnings, the strength of the core business will produce enough earnings power to offset that. And it's no one thing. It's just general performance of all our portfolios. The loss ratios in our Medicaid and Medicare business get better as the year progresses for a variety of reasons.
 Obviously, in marketplace, it's higher in the back half due to the normal seasonality of that business. But there is 90 basis points of improvement projected in the Medicaid of MCRs in the last 3 quarters of the year and 90 basis points of improvement in the Medicare MCRs in the second, third and fourth quarters. So it's just general performance of the business. The seasonality happens for a variety of reasons, general strength of the business to offset any potential earnings drag from potentially lost contracts. 
Kyle Kristick: Got it. And then I wanted to ask about the SNP regs as well. Specifically, how does that change your strategic thinking about M&A. I mean, I think the bright deal is really the first big Medicare asset begun purchased. Does this change the way you think about whether you'd be more biased towards MA or Medicaid? Or is it really just more motivation to sort of double down on the organic growth? . 
Joseph Zubretsky: It doesn't really change our M&A strategy. I mean we look for opportunities across all of [indiscernible], most of our M&A activity has been in Medicaid, but the Bright acquisition represents first M&A opportunity that we actioned in Medicare. But what we're really saying is the fact that we have this 20-state footprint in Medicaid and growing. The decent opportunity is just one more way to monetize your significant Medicaid footprint. And the fact that we have a very robust and very operationally excellent decent business. Those 2 platforms combined will allow us to participate in the duly eligible population growth rate that's going to happen here over the next number of years. So we're very, very pleased with the final rule that came out from CMS, which basically says that Medicaid will be the anchor tenant for action in the dual eligible population. 
Operator: The next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. 
Joshua Raskin: Just to go back on the Virginia and Florida. I heard the $0.80 from Texas and then the offset Virginia, Florida. Is that $0.80 an annual number? And is it, say, $0.40, $0.45 for 2024 specifically? And then just a second question on the M&A pipeline, a follow-up there as well. I'm curious if your experience with the acquisition of Bright and then the 2025 rate update. Has that changed the way you thought about Medicare Advantage? 
Joseph Zubretsky: I'll kick it to Mark for the question on the Florida and Virginia earnings. Go ahead. 
Mark Keim: On Virginia and Florida, just to set the stage, we think right now, that's about a $2 billion revenue run rate and about $1.10 on EPS full year. Now the simplifying assumption is we lose both in the fourth quarter, the headwind would be $0.5 billion on revenue and $0.30. But look, we're still working that through. Those are under protest and exactly what the timing is, is somewhat unclear. But if you deposit that assumption, it would be a $0.30 component to this year's guidance. which, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, is offset by the underlying strength of the business. So if the full run rate is $1.10, we recognized $0.30 this year, what's left is $0.80 for embedded earnings. -- and that is exactly offset by the $0.80 of accretion we see in STAR and CHIP. 
Joseph Zubretsky: Josh,and your second question related to Bright now that we've owned the business for a full quarter, we are very optimistic and confident in the $1 of ultimate accretion. The way to think about that business is actually very simple. Operationally breakeven in year 1 with a slight earnings drag related to the carrying costs, breakeven in your -- operationally breakeven in year 2. And full $1 accretion in year 3 and we get there by -- we inherited a 95% MCR in the business. We've managed it to 87%. We inherited a 13% G&A ratio in the business. We managed to 8%, that's 1,300 basis points of turnaround, which on $1.6 billion of revenue would show you how we get to the full accretion. 
 The G&A savings will likely happen sooner as we need to go through 2 pricing cycles to get the MCR down to 87%. But now that we've owned it for a quarter and have excellent line of sight to the operating metrics and the dynamics of the business we're very confident in producing that portion of our embedded earnings. 
Operator: And the next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. 
Stephen Baxter: Two questions for you. Just first, I was hoping you could potentially spike out the new store Medicaid impact to MLR? And then when you think about the 90 basis point improvement that you're talking about, how much of that is normal seasonality versus maybe new store coming down or maybe just getting back some of the last bit of acuity adjustment? And then the second question is just on the Medicaid deal pipeline. I think your last announcement on that front? I know they still take a long time to close was in July, I think, 2022. I was just wondering if you could give us an update on the pipeline there? And it seems like maybe there's been some slowdown maybe as reformation distribution, maybe it's now just kind of hear when you think about the pipeline in Medicaid over the next 6 to 12 months. 
Joseph Zubretsky: Stephen, I'll answer the first question first and then kick it to Mark on the Medicaid MCR. The Medicaid MCR of 89.7% in the quarter was as expected and heavily influenced by 20% of the member month volume in the quarter was on new business, either new business that came in from California and Nebraska on [ 11 ] or our -- second half of our Iowa contract from 2023 in the My Choice acquisition. That new business runs in the '90s. So you can do the math. That created pressure on the Medicaid MCR in the first quarter. 
 As we work through the Molina playbook, operational improvements across all the dimensions of managed care, that performance improves, second, third and fourth quarter, which really creates a very different tilt to the way the earnings pattern is emerging this year versus prior years. It starts out high and improved throughout the year. As I said, the MCRs in the last few quarters are 90 basis points better than the first and we're still on target to hit 89% in our full year guidance on Medicaid, which is at the top end of our long-term target range. Mark? 
Mark Keim: Stephen, I'd just add to that. A year ago, our Medicaid MCR was 88.4%. This quarter, the legacy NCR was very close to that. So as Joe mentioned, coming out at 89.7% is a function of that new store MCR, which comes in hot. And recall, we said that this year, margins and earnings were a little bit back-end loaded consistent with our expectations. We came out really right where we expected. On the deal pipeline, I wouldn't say it slowed down. It's always fits and starts. What's most important to Joe and I is we constantly have a pipeline of advanced stage discussions. 
 Sometimes they're banker processes, but just as often, they're one-off bespoke discussions, relationship development where we're out selling the Molina story, which is very appealing to many not-for-profits. So we've got a good pipeline of both if we could waive our wand and time them exactly where we want it, you might have seen one this quarter. But look, we are always hopeful that the pipeline is developing. We like what we see. So stay tuned on that. 
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. 
Kevin Fischbeck: Can you talk a little bit about how redeterminations are going, both from the Medicaid and the exchange side of things. It sounds like you're 90% done, but you still expect strong growth on the exchanges. I guess when should that tailwind kind of be fully into the numbers? And then on the Medicaid side, you talked about a 30% recapture rate. Just trying to see any details about the acuity of that population. 
Joseph Zubretsky: I'll start off and then I'll kick it to Mark, but just to recap the entire redetermination process from start to finish. We estimate that at the high of the PHE, we have grown 1 million members due to the pause in the redetermination process. We are now projecting to lose 600,000 of those, 550,000 lost to date, another 50,000 in the second quarter. we have been experiencing a 30% reconnect rate. And once the redetermination process stops, that reconnect rate will continue on into the late spring and perhaps even into the summer. 
 We are seeing a significant increase in our special enrollment in marketplace. Now whether you're coming in from Medicaid or not is a self-reporting feature. So we don't have exact statistics on how many are coming from other companies' Medicaid roles. But we've been averaging 12,000 to 15,000 SEP members in prior quarters, and that's double. It's up to 30,000 hour, which is obviously being heavily influenced by members coming off of Medicaid into marketplace. Mark, anything to add? 
Mark Keim: Yes. If you look at our marketplace, we reported 346,000 members in the first quarter. We'll go to 370,000 per our original guidance. That's unchanged. And that's on the continued strength of folks coming in from redeterminations, which is obviously an anomaly this year. Remember, Marketplace always had normal lapses through the year. So typically, marketplace volumes declined through the year. in this case, will increase through the year to our guidance of 370,000.I think you asked about the reconnect rate. We're still seeing 30% on reconnects coming back in. And both the folks coming in to marketplace as well as the reconnects, we're not seeing an anomaly on the MORs that would really change our outlook for the year. So pretty much right on track, Kevin, right where we want to be. . 
Operator: And the next question comes from A.J Rice with UBS. 
Albert Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe just to follow on that last train of thought, but a little different focus. Obviously, as we move into next year, you'll have given the redeterminations will subside as we get through the summer.  you'll have the full impact of whatever change on the acuity risk pool there is, for legacy, people to stay on the Medicaid. When you sort of look at that at this early date, you got -- you signaled that you got these decent rate increases proactively in 17 states this year. Do you need a second year, do you think, of above-average rate increases when that acuity is fully reflected in the run rate for all of next year? 
 And what is the timing on knowing whether you're getting adequate rate increases for next year? 
Joseph Zubretsky: Let me recap where we are in the rate environment, and then I'll kick it to Mark for some more color. We couldn't be more pleased with the way our state customers have responded to having rates be commensurate with normal cost trends and trends that have been influenced by the acuity shift. We received acuity-related adjustments in 19 states, representing 95% of our revenue. We had 5 retroactive rate adjustments, and we're actually anticipating perhaps 4 more. So the states have been very responsive and rates have been actual really sound. 
 Look, we're guiding to the top end of our MCR rate for the entire year at 89%, and that's with 2 very unprecedented phenomenon going on in the book of business. One is the unprecedented shift in the national [indiscernible] due to the redetermination process, and the other is bringing on 800,000 new members that committed higher MCRs. With those 2 found on influencing how medical costs emerge, producing an MCR at the high end of our long-term range is something we're very, very pleased with. 
 The answer is no. We expect rates next year to be actually sound, we expect them to be commensurate with the medical cost trends we're experiencing, fee schedule increases, benefits carved in and out, that's the normal process, and we have every reason to believe that rates will be actually sound going into next year. Mark, anything to add? 
Mark Keim: You mentioned the rate increase is kind of proactive, there probably more reactive, right, as so many of the states react to observe trends as opposed to proactively put it in. I wish they did. But as Joe mentioned, we're okay with the rate increases for this year. The rate increases we've seen look like they match the trend we're expecting. In we saw the acuity impact on trend really level off. And I think that's commensurate with the volume. So far, we've had 550,000 members leave only 50,000 were in this last quarter. So it's really leveled off. 
 And we've seen a similar impact with the reAcquity-- redebt acuity impact here. So right now, I'd say rates look okay for the year. If they're not, the good news is 50% of our revenue comes up for new rates every January 1 which means if there's back half pressure this year, it's time really well for January 1 on the next rate cycle. 
Albert Rice: Okay. And maybe if I could just ask on the Marketplace product. Obviously, the last 1, 1.5 years, you've been focused on repricing and margin. Now that you sort of have gotten that in place. Any update on your long-term strategy toward marketplace and growing that? Or what's your thought on that? 
Joseph Zubretsky: Sure. A.J., the small silver and stable strategy was a short-term reaction to having to re-position the business to maintain a profile of single digit -- mid-single digit pretax margins. That was a temporal way to look at the business. we invested about 300 basis points of what call excess margin from last year into the business this year, and that's why we're growing membership at 30% and premium revenues are growing at 20%. So we like the nice steady progression of the business. We do expect to grow it. But being in the insurance business as long as I have, you never try to grow any portfolio organically that quickly because when underwriting isn't allowed, which -- that's what this product is, you have to be very wary of where you're bidding against the market, who else is in the market and where your results are coming out for the prior year. So we're going to be cautious. But the nice steady growth we saw this year feels really good to us. We're able to maintain a profile of high single-digit pretax margins and grow at this rate I think that's what to expect. 
Operator: The next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. 
Justin Lake: A couple of questions here. First, last quarter, Joe, you mentioned an expectation that the company had visibility to grow EPS at the low end of your 15% to 18% outlook for 2025. Is that still the expectation? And then secondly, Joe, you mentioned that you're assuming in Texas or it looks like you're assuming in Texas that you get an average amount of share of the state from your new wins meaning there's 4 plants in a region, you get 25%.
 First, is that correct? And then second, what are the level of visibility here? The reason I ask is that your local regional market share in Medicaid varies pretty broadly by state across plans. Texas, your share currently appears to be in the high-single digits versus a state like Washington, where I recall you have way above average share. I'm just curious on your visibility on getting that. 
Joseph Zubretsky: Yes. Justin, the -- last quarter, we gave you the building blocks for an outlook into 2025, and we have not changed our view of those building blocks. Obviously, embedded earnings still at $4, we have actually changed the composition of that and how those emerge in upcoming years has changed slightly. But the building blocks haven't changed. We continue to harvest earnings out of our existing footprint. We talked about operating leverage, talk about embedded earnings. Obviously, there likely will be a natural headwind from interest rate declines into next year. So the building blocks haven't changed, and that's still our forward look for 2025, again, not guidance, but an outlook. On Texas, we don't know. We used very conservative estimates of what our market share would likely to be in the 7 regions that we won and use kind of the average portfolio margins. I don't think there's anything more to read into it than that. We think it's a conservative and reasonable estimate of what that business will produce. 
Justin Lake: So can you share that market share assumption? 
Joseph Zubretsky: I don't -- it's far too early, and we don't want to get ahead of our customer on that. So we'll wait and see until we have more visibility into how membership will be allocated. I think that's the prudent thing to do here. 
Operator: The next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. 
Nathan Rich: I wanted to ask on Florida. Joe, I think you talked about the protests and the ultimate outcome could be different. I guess I'd be curious to get your view, Florida kind of shifted to more of a comprehensive care model in the state. And in your view, does that create, I guess, more friction than normal for the appeals process and potential changes there? And then as a follow-up, I wanted to ask if you had an updated view on the $46 billion revenue target by 2026.
 Obviously, that included some assumption for RFP wins, but there are a number of other factors in that bucket. So just curious if you still feel like that's the right shooting point for 2026 revenue. 
Joseph Zubretsky: In, on Florida, we're not making a prediction on how the process will unfold. We're citing historical precedent. Historical precedent would suggest that this is not the end, it's sort of the beginning of the end of the process. that there's more discussions that will take place. So I don't want to, again, get ahead of the state on this. But if you look at the past 2 procurements in Florida, there have been extended conversations and there are regions in Florida that still do not have maximum awards given. So again, just citing historical precedent. On the $46 billion of revenue, but we have a $60 billion new contract pipeline. Kansas and Georgia are sitting out there currently live and in process. as I mentioned, Texas STAR Kids. We have great momentum in the State of Texas. 
 North Carolina, we didn't be down North Carolina last time because it was too early in our turnaround plan to bid on anything. So we're looking at the $60 billion pipeline and feeling pretty good about our prospects there. Look, we're for 7 for 9 reprocurements and we started our growth journey. We're 8 for 10 and new business wins. We have 8 M&A transactions totaling $1 billion of revenue over the past 4 years. We're feeling really good about the long-term revenue target here and our ability to produce continued 13% to 15% revenue growth and 15% to 18% earnings per share growth. Nothing's changed. And our trajectory here, even though we're disappointed with the 2 RFP situations in the second quarter -- in the first quarter. 
Operator: The next question comes from Gary Taylor with TD Calin. 
Gary Taylor: I had 2 policy questions actually. One, just because I get asked a lot just about the expiring ACA credits for 2026, maybe leaving aside whether or not they get renewed and the politics of that. Just wondering, from a technical basis, how are you guys thinking about sort of elasticity of demand for exchange product, if some of the income level categories see a fairly material percentage change in the premium that would be required, just what you're thinking now, if end of the worst case, those went away. What the impact might be, how much is retained. 
 And then the second question would just be the big Medicaid rule that was out earlier this week, managed care, Medicaid rule. I think we were primarily focused on the state-directed payments changes there, but I know there are a few things on MCO transparency, MLR reporting changes. I just wanted to see if there's anything that you felt was material to you going forward. 
Joseph Zubretsky: On the -- I believe your first question was on the enhanced subsidies for Marketplace. I understand it -- it's hard to say. -- bear in mind, they do go away unless legislation is passed to extend them. That's -- sometimes that's misunderstood. They are going away because the subsidy enhancement was temporary. and a less legislation is passed to extend them they will. 
 Now I can go through all types of political scenarios and legislative scenarios. There's lots of people who think that, that can easily be given up for an extension of the Trump tax cuts. I'm not going to make any political conclusions here, but it's probably a 50-50 push on how that gets done and if it gets done. We did not grow significantly when those enhanced subsidies came in because our members, keep in mind, we leverage our Medicaid footprint. We go after highly subsidized, low-income members and we didn't benefit a lot by the enhanced subsidies as most of our membership was already very, very highly subsidized. So from our perspective, we're not looking at it as a huge issue for us in terms of membership loss. And that's the way I would answer the first part of your question. The second part had to do with which ruling. I want to make sure I understood your question. 
Gary Taylor: The managed care, the Medicaid managed care access finance quality accrual that was out earlier this week. 
Joseph Zubretsky: Not significant. We're still analyzing it. We're obviously aware of it. We're analyzing it. lots of different features to it, many of which incept over very extended periods of time. So there's nothing to immediately react to. But nothing in that guideline changes of the long-term trajectory of the business. As I've said many times, I often asked, is there any political legislative or judicial environmental issue that causes you major concern on the viability of the businesses you're in. And the answer is no. The way the election comes out, whether Congress is split, whether things can get done vis-a-vis the 60 votes in the Senate needed to do something fundamental, the reconciliation process, et cetera. We don't -- we think the legislative and political scenarios are pretty neutral for the sustainability of the businesses we're in. 
Mark Keim: Gary, the one thing I would point out is certainly when they streamline Medicaid and chip eligibility and all the procedural items that folks have to go through to maintain or get eligibility, it just makes it easier for the appropriate coverage to go to the right people, and we think that's obviously a good tailwind for our business. 
Operator: The next question comes from George Hill, Deutsche Bank. 
George Hill: Joe, just a high-level question. One of your peers this week talked about a normalized individual MA margin of 3% or better. I know that your book of business is a little bit different. But I was just wondering if you guys would be willing to kind of speak to what you think the normalized margin profile of individual MA is and kind of how you think that varies between the D-SNP book and the individual book. And I know that you guys have a heavily subsidized population. So the book is a little bit different, but I appreciate any color. 
Joseph Zubretsky: Yes. Well, our target for our Medicare business is mid-single-digit pretax. I wasn't sure whether you're referring to pretax or after tax, our NCR range for the products we're in is 87% to 88%. As we said, we hope to get -- not hope. We're projecting to get right down to 87% here over the next couple of years. So we still target mid-single-digit pretax margins in this business. 
 We like the D-SNP business not only can produce excellent profits, but monetizing our Medicaid footprint for dual eligible population here over time is going to be a significant growth category for us. So we're perfectly positioned, but at least we're well, well positioned to take advantage of the growth in the deorgible population here, and we still target mid-single-digit pretax margins, MCRs in the 87% to 88% range. 
Mark Keim: George, the only thing I'd add is it's really hard to compare a Molina book of business to some of our big competitors in Medicare. Remember, we skew really heavily to the dual eligibles. So we've got an awful lot of our book in the high teens to $2,000 PMPMs, which are high acuity. If you're very good at managing medical costs -- there's a big opportunity on those high-dollar members to get to the margins that Joe talked about, even in the presence of some headwinds. So I think it's really hard to make that comparison to others. 
Operator: And the next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. 
Scott Fidel: Two questions. The first one, just if you've gotten the scoring results yet from Florida and have been able to start to develop the factual points that may be the basis of your appeal in Florida is definitely interested in your thoughts on that? And then just second, on the HICS side, just if you want to refresh us at this point after seeing results so far, what you're expecting for full year MLR and pretax margin offer 2024 for the HICS business. 
Joseph Zubretsky: On these protest processes, I think I've said about all I really should say about them. They are legal processes, and we have to see how they unfold. But of course, through various requests, I'm sure everybody's got the information they need to document their findings and to put their case forward. So that's all I'll say about it. 
 Your last question was about market to marketplace. As I said, we, last year, having good visibility into the business, having priced up, we were producing pretax margins in low double-digit [indiscernible] 10%, 11%. We decided consciously to invest 3 in some places, 400 basis points of that margin into growth, which is why membership grew 30% and revenues grew 20%. 
 So we're well positioned to continue to produce our target MCR range, which is 78% to 80%. And this year, we expect to finish the year at the low end of that range. which would produce a high single-digit pretax margin. It's right where we want to be. And as somebody suggested earlier, a very now stable position, half the membership being renewal membership, 70% of it being silver, a nice platform off of which to grow measurably and modestly. 
Scott Fidel: Okay. Got it. So reaffirming the initial guidance you gave us for the exchange MLR margin? 
Operator: And the next question comes from Andrew Mok with Barclays. 
Andrew Mok: I think I heard you say that you're prudent in your reserves due to change. Was there any favorable PYD in the quarter? And if so, did you reestablish that into your reserves? 
Mark Keim: It's Mark. Yes, absolutely, there's favorable PYD, and you'll see that in the earnings release where we showed the prior year development on current year reserves. It tracks about as it normally does, not higher, not lower. And of course, we always replenish that. So we feel very confident I showed a 49% days claims payable, which is right in the middle of our standard range. We feel very good about our reserves even with a little bit of noise from the change situation that happened back in February. So very confident, reserves replenished, we feel adequately reserved. 
Andrew Mok: Was there any P&L impact in the quarter from the PYD? 
Mark Keim: There always is. That's a normal part of a reserving cycle. Typically, the way you reserve is in the current period, you pick a number, which is generally a little bit conservative. And typically, prior periods developed favorably. That is a standard cycle of the actuarial and reserving process and how we recognize earnings. Nothing unusual there in this quarter. 
Operator: And the next question comes from Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald. 
Sarah James: I wanted to clarify the mix on the 2026 revenue guide. So IDA, you guys talked about it being about 1/4 organic, quarter M&A and 50% contracts contract wins. Do you still see that as the mix? And then could you give us any clarity on your rate renewal timing? What percentage of your book renews in January versus April and September. 
Joseph Zubretsky: I'll answer the second question first. We have a really nicely laddered renewal pattern in our portfolio, which is great from a risk management perspective. of our revenue renews on January 1. 21% renews in the fall. The rest of it is [indiscernible] so the renewal pattern is nicely better throughout the year. Right now, given our guidance, we know 82% of rates, we know the rates on 82% of our revenue for this year's revenue guide, which leaves us very little rate risk to our forecast. That's the -- that's how we have great visibility. And as Mark said, if you get pressure, cost pressure, in the second half of the year. In fact, at 52% of the revenue then cycles into January 1, or we capture that nicely. Your other question was? 
Sarah James: Yes. On the $46 billion premium rev in 2026, do you think of it as the buckets that you laid out at I-Day, which was about 50% of the growth being from contract wins, 25% from M&A, 25% from organic? 
Joseph Zubretsky: Yes. I think that's nothing has caused us to change that outlook. I mean it's a very high-level outlook and more of it comes from M&A, that's fine. When you're buying the properties with the capital efficiency, we buy them at which we buy them. But that actual mix could change, but that's probably the way to think about it. That is the way we think about it. But again, if the mix changes, we have more contract wins and more M&A. It's all very accretive and as long as we're refilling the bucket of embedded earnings, we feel good about it. 
Operator: And this concludes the question session as well as the call itself. Thank you so much for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your phone lines.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-08 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Molina Healthcare Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. Standing in for Joe Krocheski today is Jeff Geyer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jeff Geyer: Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare's fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky, and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those of you who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that all of the remarks made are as of today, Thursday, February 8, 2024, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. On this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures for 2023 and 2024 can be found in our fourth quarter 2023 earnings release. During the call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our 2024 guidance, Medicaid redeterminations, our recent RFP awards and related revenue growth, our recent acquisition and M&A activity, our long-term growth strategy and our embedded earnings power and projected 2025 earnings per share. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report filed with the SEC as well as our risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?
Joe Zubretsky: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Today, I will discuss several topics. Our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, our growth initiatives and our strategy for sustaining profitable growth, our 2024 premium revenue and earnings guidance and an affirmation of our long-term growth targets. Let me start with our fourth quarter performance. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.38 on $8.4 billion of premium revenue. Our fourth quarter results and performance metrics demonstrated strong medical cost management and operating cost discipline. Medicaid continued to perform well, withstanding the impacts of the unprecedented redetermination process. Medicare experienced higher than target medical costs, consistent with prior quarters and Marketplace performed very well despite the late in-year medical cost seasonality typically experienced. Our fourth quarter completes a strong year of operating and financial performance. Full year adjusted earnings per share of $20.88 represents 17% year-over-year growth, squarely in line with our long-term target range of 15% to 18% and 6% above our initial 2023 guidance of at least $19.75. Our full year premium revenue of $32.5 billion represents 5% year-over-year growth, and our pretax margin of 4.8% is at the high end of our long-term target range heading into 2024. In Medicaid, our flagship business representing over 80% of revenue, we reported an 88.7% MCR for the full year, which is within our long-term target range. Throughout the redetermination process, we have managed through a number of factors that shape Medicaid's performance, all to land the full year result at a solid jump-off point into 2024. These factors included medical cost utilization, various state corridors and MLR minimums and prospective rate changes. In Medicare, the full year MCR was 90.7%. While the business is profitable, we did not meet our performance expectations due to higher utilization of supplemental benefits, in-home services and high-cost drugs. I am confident that our 2024 bid strategy, adjustments to benefit design and various operational improvements will return the business to target margins in 2024. In Marketplace, we reported a 75.3% MCR for the full year, below the low end of our target range, which reflects the successful execution of our small, silver and stable strategy. This business is now positioned to grow at a rate, which allows us to sustain mid-single-digit margins. In addition to delivering strong financial results, in 2023, we continued to execute on our profitable growth strategy. To recap the growth milestones achieved in 2023. In January, we successfully reprocured our contract in Texas for the state's STAR+PLUS program, retaining all eight regions and likely growing market share. In July, we successfully launched our Iowa Medicaid plan following the RFP, which we had won in a highly competitive process in late 2022. In August, we announced that we were awarded a contract to once again serve Medicaid beneficiaries in the state of New Mexico. In September, we closed on the My Choice Wisconsin acquisition, further expanding our market-leading LTSS franchise. In June, we agreed to acquire Bright Health's California Medicare business, which we have now closed effective January 1, 2024. Also effective January 1 and after another win in a highly competitive bid process, we successfully launched our Nebraska health plan. And finally, on January 1, we launched our expanded California platform, including Los Angeles County, which doubled the size of our business in the state. Collectively, these acquisitions and RFP successes represent $7 billion of annual premium revenue, a portion of which was in our 2023 results, most of which is in our 2024 guidance and all of which will be fully realized in 2025. To say we are pleased with the execution of our 2023 growth initiatives would be an understatement. But the growth story doesn't stop there. The pipeline of opportunities, fueling our future growth trajectory is extremely strong. Let me begin with reprocurements. We have submitted our RFP responses for contract renewals in Florida, Virginia and Michigan. We are proven partners with all three of these states, and we are confident in our ability to retain and grow these relationships. With regard to new state opportunities, including the Florida opportunity just described, there is over $50 billion of total premium revenue opportunity, active or near term, up for bid in several states over the coming years. We have already submitted bids in the states of Kansas and Georgia. With our demonstrated capabilities and referenceable track record, we remain confident in our ability to continue to win new state contracts. With respect to our M&A initiatives, our acquisition pipeline remains robust with actionable opportunities and we are confident in our ability to deliver growth from this key component of our strategy. Since 2019, we have completed eight transactions having acquired over $11 billion of premium for which we paid 22% of revenue. This capital allocation to M&A will continue to be a value driver. Turning now to our 2024 guidance. We project 2024 premium revenue of approximately $38 billion, which is consistent with our previous outlook and represents 17% year-over-year growth. We project 2024 adjusted earnings per share of at least $23.50, representing 13% year-over-year growth. Mark will take you through the detailed guidance build in a few minutes. But in the meantime, let me offer some high-level commentary. Our projected premium revenue growth to $38 billion represents a well-balanced combination of new contract wins, acquisitions and growth in our current footprint, partially offset by the impact of Medicaid redeterminations. With respect to earnings guidance in the core business, in Medicaid, our guidance fully considers the impact of the redetermination process. From a margin perspective, this is playing out as we have predicted. The impact of acuity shifts is real, but not significant. The risk corridors acted as a financial buffer and rates prospective and retrospective are largely capturing the trend impact. On a same-store basis, we are projecting the 2024 Medicaid MCR to be within our long-term range. We expect Medicare to return to mid-single-digit profitability in 2024 as a result of our bid strategy, adjustments to benefit design and operational improvements in the legacy business. Our Marketplace product has been priced right, is competitively positioned and the risk pool has stabilized. We expect the business to achieve mid to high single-digit margins, membership to grow over 30% and revenue to grow 17%. On top of our 2024 earnings per share guidance of at least $23.50, we now have $4 per share of new store embedded earnings, which, as you may recall, represents the expected accretion produced by our new store growth. Mark will review the components of the updated $4 per share in his remarks. Our confidence in our 2024 guidance starts with a high-quality 2023 earnings baseline and then takes a thorough account of all the various factors, exogenous and company-specific, that could impact earnings in 2024. Now, a few comments on our longer-term trajectory. Our 2024 guidance picture is one more data point that validates our long-term targets of 13% to 15% premium growth and 15% to 18% adjusted earnings per share growth. We committed to these targets at our Investor Day last May, and we reaffirm that commitment today. With the majority of the $4 of new store embedded earnings expected to emerge in 2025, we already see a clear outlook to achieving the low end of our long-term EPS growth target in 2025, even before considering the execution of additional growth initiatives and driving growth from our current footprint. In summary, we are very pleased with our 2023 performance, our trajectory to deliver the growth and profitability inherent in our 2024 guidance and the embedded earnings outlook we provided for 2025. Our confidence in continuing to achieve our long-term targets is data-driven as demonstrated by the following historical fact set. We have reprocured approximately $12 billion in existing revenue. We have added approximately $7 billion of new revenue through wins of new or expanded contracts in seven states. From 2020 to 2023, we achieved 21% annual premium growth and 25% annual earnings per share growth. 2024 guidance, 17% premium revenue growth year-over-year, 13% earnings per share growth year-over-year. And for 2025, and we expect to harvest the majority of our $4 per share of embedded earnings. Our strategy is clear and simple. We are in the business of providing access to high-quality health care for individuals relying on government assistance. Our business model is also clear and simple. We take on capitated risk, take or make rates that are commensurate with medical cost trends, and manage those trends to consistently achieve our target margins while maintaining higher standards of quality. The execution of our strategy and business model has been and will continue to be strong which is why we look to the future with a great deal of confidence. In conclusion, I want to extend my special thanks to our 19,000 associates who are dedicated to delivering access to high-quality healthcare to our members. It is my privilege to serve with such a committed and capable group of professionals. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark?
Mark Keim: Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss some additional details on our fourth quarter and full year performance, the balance sheet redeterminations and our 2024 guidance. Beginning with our fourth quarter and full year results. For the quarter, we reported $9 billion in total revenue and $8.4 billion of premium revenue. I will note that total revenue includes approximately $380 million in reimbursement for our California MCO tax item that was retrospective to April. This item modestly distorts our reported G&A and margin ratios, but has no net economic consequence. On a consolidated basis, our fourth quarter MCR was 89.1% and our full year was 88.1%, reflecting continued strong medical cost management. Our full year consolidated MCR was consistent with our expectations and squarely in line with our long-term target range. In Medicaid, our fourth quarter reported MCR was 89.2%. The MCR included a moderate impact from the net effect of redetermination acuity shifts and corridors in several states, as well as some MCR pressure from the additions of our Iowa health plan and our My Choice acquisition. Across our Medicaid segment, the major medical cost categories were largely in line with our expectations and normal quarter-to-quarter trend fluctuations. Our full year Medicaid MCR was 88.7%, within our long-term target range and consistent with our expectations. In Medicare, our fourth quarter reported MCR was 93.3% and our full year was 90.7%, both above our long-term target range and impacted by increased utilization of supplemental benefits, in-home services and high-cost drugs. As Joe mentioned, we are confident that our 2024 bid strategy adjustments to benefit design as well as operational improvements will produce target margins in our Medicare business in 2024. In Marketplace, our reported fourth quarter MCR was 79.8%, reflecting our continued success in returning this business to target margins. Our full year Marketplace MCR of 75.3% was well below our long-term target range. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 7% as reported. However, when accounting for the California pass-through premium tax item, the ratio restates to 7.3%. This result includes new business implementation spending for new contract wins in California, Nebraska and New Mexico as well as expected seasonal expenditures from Medicare and Marketplace marketing. Our full year adjusted G&A ratio was 7.2%. Recognizing the California tax item in the fourth quarter, the full year G&A ratio restated to 7.3%. Turning to our Bright acquisition. We successfully closed the transaction effective this past January 1, at final price of $425 million net of tax benefits which was lower than our initially announced terms. The acquisition adds 109,000 members and contributes $1.6 billion in premium this year. We acquired the business with a premium deficiency reserve, which is expected to moderate first year losses, but we still expect the acquisition to be approximately $0.50 dilutive to 2024 adjusted EPS. Now that we have owned the business for six weeks, we have increased confidence in our assumption that the Bright acquisition will deliver an ultimate accretion of $1 per share as final run rate margin. Given the expectation of this modest lot in the first year, we are updating the 2024 new store embedded earnings from the Bright acquisition to $1.50 per share, reflecting this $0.50 of first year dilution. Moving on to Medicaid redeterminations. In the quarter, we estimate we lost 200,000 members driven by redeterminations, bringing the full year figure to approximately 500,000. We are now updating our estimate of members gained during the pandemic to 1 million to include new business additions in 2023 and 2024 as well as the legacy business. Given the high rate of procedural disenrollments rather than through verification, we are seeing a nearly 30% reconnect rate, consistent with previous quarters. As reconnects continue, we expect the membership losses just described to restate to a lower level over the coming months. We continue to project ultimately retaining 40% of our updated members gained, which implies a net loss of 600,000 from the redetermination process. The offsetting positive impact from our growth initiatives is significant. We ended 2022 with 4.8 million Medicaid members, and we expect to close out 2024 with 5.1 million members, a net 300,000 member growth over a two-year period, despite the losses from redetermination. Moving to Medicaid rates. We now have visibility into rates impacting approximately 80% of our 2024 premium. All but one of our states have now included an acuity adjustment for redetermination for 2024. We continue to work with our state partners to ensure appropriate rates through the normal rate cycle, retroactive or mid-cycle adjustments given the experience to date. We are confident that the requirement for actuarially sound rates will offset trends as they may emerge. Updated rates and trend assumptions have been considered in the 2024 Medicaid MCR that supports our guidance. Turning to our balance sheet. Our capital foundation remains strong. We harvested approximately $280 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, and our parent company cash balance was approximately $740 million, a portion of which was used to fund the Bright Medicare acquisition just after the first of the year. Debt at the end of the quarter was 1.4 times trailing 12-month EBITDA with our debt-to-cap ratio at 36.3%. These ratios reflect our low leverage position and ample cash and capital capacity for additional growth and investment. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, we are confident in the strength of our reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 50. Now some additional details on our 2024 guidance, beginning with membership. In Medicaid, we expect new membership from our recent new contract wins to add approximately 650,000 members. We expect to lose 100,000 members over the remainder of the redetermination process in 2024. The net result in 2024 year-end membership of approximately 5.1 million members or 12% growth year-over-year. In Medicare, the Bright acquisition added 109,000 members. Combined with our legacy business, we expect to end 2024 with 270,000 Medicare members, representing 58% growth year-over-year. In Marketplace, based on open enrollment, we expect to begin 2024 with approximately 320,000 members, representing 14% growth from year-end 2023. We expect growth to continue through the year, boosted by the redetermination conversions and ending with approximately 370,000 members, representing 31% growth year-over-year. We are still 75% silver, which bodes well for medical margin stability. Our 2024 premium revenue guidance is approximately $38 billion, representing 17% growth from 2023. Our revenue growth is comprised of several items, $3.3 billion of revenue tied to our recent RFP wins. To this, we add $2.4 billion of revenue from our recently closed acquisitions, including $1.6 billion from Bright and $800 million from a full year of My Choice Wisconsin. And finally, $1.7 billion of organic growth across Medicaid, Medicare and Marketplace. Partially offsetting these growth drivers is a higher estimated full year impact of $1.9 billion in decreased revenue from redeterminations. Moving on to earnings guidance. We expect 2024 full year adjusted earnings of at least $23.50 per share. Our EPS guidance reflects the realization of approximately $2 per share of 2023 new store embedded earnings, approximately $2 for the underlying organic growth across our current Medicaid and Medicare footprints, the realization of $0.75 benefit from the onetime nonrecurring implementation costs incurred in 2023, partially offset by $1.25 impact from redeterminations and $0.50 impact from the Bright acquisitions first year operating and carrying costs and finally, $0.25 from a conservative view of earnings contribution from investment income. Turning to MCR guidance. Our consolidated Medical Care Ratio is expected to be 88.2%. Our Medicaid MCR is expected to be 89%, at the high end of our long-term target range. This guidance reflects the inclusion of our significant new store growth, which runs at a higher MCR in the first year. Our legacy or same-store Medicaid MCR is expected to fall in the middle of our long-term range. We anticipate our Medicare MCR to be 88%, while at the high end of our long-term target range, the MCR reflects our expected success in our 2024 bid strategy adjustments to benefit design and various operational improvements. For Marketplace, we expect the MCR at the low end of the long-term target MCR range of 78% to 80%. Moving on to select P&L guidance metrics. We expect our adjusted G&A ratio to fall to 7% as new business implementation costs subside, and we leverage the increased scale of our business. Effective tax rate of 25.7%. Adjusted pretax margin of 4.6%, well within our long-term target range. Weighted average share count unchanged at 58.1 million shares. And our quarterly EPS will be weighted slightly heavier towards the second half of the year as we drive improved performance in our new business portfolio additions over the course of the year. Turning to embedded earnings. We ended 2023 with $5.50 per share of new store embedded earnings. Our 2024 guidance includes the realization of $2, resulting in a new base of $3.50. To this, we add $0.50 for the impact of Bright acquisitions first year loss, leaving us with $4 remaining at the end of 2024. We expect the majority of this to emerge in 2025 giving us further confidence in our 15% to 18% long-term growth rate for EPS. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.
A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe 2 things. On the Medicare MLR margin, it sounds like you're attributing your improvements you're expecting largely to benefit design changes and operational improvements. Any comment on what you're assuming relative to underlying utilization trends? And then just on the Medicaid, you're sounding like you'll be on the legacy business in the middle of your long term MLR targets. How are you thinking about margin profile coming out of redeterminations? Is there an opportunity for further improvement? Is it steady? Any thoughts on that?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, A.J. With respect to the Medicare MLR question, we have three components of medical costs that ran higher than expectations. One was LTSS hours on the Medicaid side of the MMP business. Second, high-cost drugs. And third, supplemental benefits, vision, dental, cash card, over the counter was a little too richly designed in 2023 to be honest. We pulled back on those benefits in our 2024 product design and bids. We reshaped some of the allowance-based benefits to be more managed, and we're confident that that cost category will come back into line. On LTSS hours on the Medicaid side of the MMP benefit, we know where, we know why, and those corrective actions are in place. And it's not unusual in a soft economy for in-home service hours to increase. So we are very confident in the restoration of our MCRs back to the top end of the range in Medicare to 88% in 2024. You also asked about the Medicaid MLR. And let me frame it this way, and then I'll turn it to Mark. The re-determination process actually unfolded exactly as we had planned and as we had predicted. The acuity shift was noticeable, but it was -- it wasn't dramatic and it wasn't significant, but it was noticeable. And that began to happen as the redetermination process began. We then said, and it occurred, that the first financial cushion would be the corridors, the payments into the corridors that existed in the latter half of 2023. That acted as a financial buffer. In the meantime, as the acuity shift became noticeable to our state partners, they began to introduce rate adjustments to account for the acuity shift. So going into 2024, the rate actions completely compensated for what we call [poor] (ph) medical trend, completely compensated for any acuity shift, and that's why we're able to print an MCR in Medicaid at the high end of the range at 89%, which includes a little bit of pressure from the new business that we put on the books.
Mark Keim: Joe summarized that well. Look, we finished 88.7% in 2023 for Medicaid. And as Joe mentioned, that included a little bit of pressure from the acuity shift from redet, but also as we projected the benefit of some corridors. So really tracking exactly where we expect it. Here in the new year on our legacy book, trend roughly equals the rates that we're getting from our state partners. So on our legacy book into ‘24, we're roughly seeing about a flat MLR versus where we finished 2023. Now, why are we at an 89% in guidance? Just as Joe mentioned, we're adding significant new store business through both our acquisitions and a number of big wins. Whenever we have new store go into our portfolio, it tends to be a little bit hotter in the first year on an MLR. So we're seeing a pretty much flat carryover on legacy, a little bit of increased pressure on new store. That's how you get to that 89% that we have in our guidance.
A.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: The next question comes from Cal Sternick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Cal Sternick: Yeah, thanks for the question. I wanted to ask about the Marketplace. It sounds like the book is running really well and I think you were a little bit more competitively priced this year than you were previously. So I guess first, is the expectation when we talk about mid-single digit to high single digit margins that you're within sort of that 5% to 7% range, do you expect to be towards the upper half of that, or maybe a bit above? And then second, how do you think about the market and the positioning for 2025? Do you think you're still going to maintain the current pricing position or do you expect to, I guess, be more competitive across your total footprint again?
Joe Zubretsky: Our strategy in marketplace until we were satisfied that the risk pool was stabilized is to keep it as we say small, silver, and stable. But as the risk pool has stabilized, irrational pricing has pretty much left the market. We will allocate more capital to this business and we'll grow it at a rate that allows us to earn mid to high single-digit margins. That's the key for us. The risk pool can have inherent volatility and we believe that a margin target of 5% to 7% as you suggested is the right target margin and we will grow the business at a rate that allows us to achieve that target margin. We're very competitively positioned this year. We are in our silver product. We were number one and two in 30% of our counties this year as compared to 20% last year. 75% of the book is still silver. 50% of the book is renewal, which gives us good insight to capture appropriate risk scoring. The book is very well positioned to grow. 31% membership growth, 17% revenue growth just this year, and hopefully we'll be able to grow it at this rate in the future, all with the goal of achieving mid to high single-digit margins.
Cal Sternick: All right, great. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Kevin Fischbeck: All right, great. Thanks. Maybe two questions as I get in. I guess the first one on the Medicare side, I just want to make sure I understand your commentary around MLR because you're bringing in Bright with a PDR, but you're still saying you are going to be at the overall target margin. You're talking about the core business being at target margin, or even with Bright losing money you'll be at target margin on the consolidated book. And then thinking about the exchanges, I guess there was potentially some issue about redetermination to kick people off and then the sickest part of that population comes onto the exchanges. Are you seeing any of that or does the risk pool benefit of lower subsidies just kind of make that not really an issue? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Thanks, Kevin. I'm going to kick it to Mark for detailed commentary on the Medicare MLR, but I think it's really important to frame the Medicare business and its component parts. They're somewhat different and situationally, they are quite different. You have $6 billion of revenue forecasted for 2024 in Medicare. $1.6 billion is Bright newly acquired, subject to the premium deficiency reserve, as you suggested, and Mark will explain that in a minute. $2.4 billion is our legacy [indiscernible] business, and $2 billion are the MMP demonstrations, where rates are received from CMS. You're not [bidding] (ph) against the benchmark. So the dynamics in the book of business are quite different. You need to look at the three components in order to develop your view of the various profitability components. But with that as the backdrop and the context, I'll kick it to Mark for detailed commentary and how you build the Medicare MLR, particularly with respect to Bright and the premium deficiency reserves. Mark?
Mark Keim: Yeah, fantastic. Good morning, Kevin. So Bright comes to us with a PDR in place. With that PDR, the benefit goes into the MLR line and effectively reduces the MLR. So on the bright component, which is a third of our book, you'll see an MLR that's below our target range at the moment. On the DSNP, which is another third of our business, we're seeing a trend of probably around 4%. But overall, we're able to offset that and pull that into our target range. And of course, on MMP, which is the third component of the book, the rates that we're getting from our state and CMS partners, we feel are quite adequate to bring us all told to that ADA in our MLR guidance.
Joe Zubretsky: With respect to your second question, if I remember correctly, it had to do with the exchanges and members coming off of the Medicaid roles into the exchanges. If you look at the last couple of years, membership has already always started the year at a higher point and ended the year at a lower point due to the natural attrition in the book. This year, we're starting the year at 320,000 members and plan to grow it to 370,000 by the end of the year. The natural attrition rate is still 2% or 3% inside that number, but we do plan to pick up more members from not only our own Medicaid plans, but competitors' Medicaid plans. I think we're seeing a penetration rate of people coming off Medicaid of about 10% of members lost. Mark, anything to add?
Mark Keim: Yeah, in the past, when we picked up SEP members, they put a little pressure on our MLR. What we're seeing in the third and fourth quarter in ‘23, and what I expect into ‘24 is they'll come over at more sustaining and normalized levels. That is, they won't put pressure on, because they're coming off normal using services. There's not pent-up demand. They're not new to the product. So I'm expecting to see a good pickup on SEP, as we did in Q3 and Q4, and not pressure on the MLR.
Operator: The next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron. Please go ahead.
Josh Raskin: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Two for me as well. The health insurance exchange membership up 31%, but revenues up 17%. Is that state geography mix-related or is that reductions in prices and what's driving that versus a market that's generally raising prices? And then I'm still confused on Bright, how the target -- how the MLR for Bright that you're booking this year is below the target range, but you're actually increasing the embedded earnings by $0.50 to $1.50? Maybe just help us understand those two parts.
Mark Keim: So a couple of things, and good morning, Josh. Our metallic mix has remained unchanged. So what you're seeing in Marketplace is not at all metallic or mix related. That's state footprint related. As you know, we're in 14 states, and our mix among the states, as we're more competitive in some, maybe not so much in others, our mix does shift a little bit. So that'd be the driver there. On Bright, on the PDR, with the PDR that was booked before we bought the business, that benefits the MLR and pulls it down to a level that's actually a little bit below our target range. Now remember, our target range is largely DSNP and MMP because that's our legacy Medicare book. On the bright with the PDR in the MLR line, it does pull it down a little bit below our target range.
Josh Raskin: So how does that impact -- I'm just trying to -- so it feels like with the PDR, you guys will sort of reverse that through the year. How does the embedded earnings go up? Right. I'm confused with how is Bright, MLR low, but they're losing more money?
Mark Keim: It's a good question and thanks for raising that. I knew we were going to get that sooner or later. So with the PDR, as you know, the PDR should largely normalize expected operating losses on a contract year. PDR accounting doesn't allow you to put all of the losses into the PDR. There are certain accounting matters that are still held out. So even with the PDR, I'll have a very small operating loss, Josh. But the other thing is when we talk about embedded earnings, we always include the carrying costs. The embedded earnings are essentially fully capitalized or fully funded for their carrying costs. So when I say I have about $0.50 of dilution this year, it's about half operating costs that aren't covered by the PDR and about half carrying costs. Remember we paid about a half billion. The opportunity cost or interest on that is maybe the other half of the $0.50. So as a result, I'm carrying a $0.50 hole in this year's EPS bridge. Since that's a $0.50 hole, I said I'd have $1 of ultimate benefit from this property. The dollar now goes to $1.50 because I'm going to crawl out of that hole over the next couple of years.
Josh Raskin: Okay. Got it. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Justin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. I just want to follow up on Bright. So a few things here. First, can you give me the PDR number that you put through there for 2024?
Mark Keim: Sure, we acquired the business with a $75 million PDR on the balance sheet.
Justin Lake: Okay, and so you're saying the -- I understand the PDR getting it to normal levels potentially, but how does the PDR get it below normal MLR levels?
Mark Keim: The PDR books all of the losses. It picks up a little bit of the G&A losses, with the medical cost losses, and books them into the medical cost line. So to the extent that there were some G&A items, it'll get picked up in the MLR line. It's just an accounting convention where the net of losses get picked up in one line item or the other.
Justin Lake: Okay, so your point is that just thinking about the math of this, the MLR is going to go up next year because it's actually below normal and you're saying the SG&A will come down.
Mark Keim: There will be a little bit of that, Justin.
Justin Lake: Okay. And you expect to get this full dollar back plus in 2025?
Joe Zubretsky: And that's the important point. The important point here, first of all, the first year losses were fully contemplated in the value we paid. So there was no surprise there. The business is running at a 92% MCR and a 14% G&A ratio. We plan to get the 92% down to 88% to 89% and the 14% down to 9% to 10%. So half to two thirds of the turn is G&A related and we have very, very clear line of sight to how to take their cost burden down from 14% to 9% or 10% where it should be. That dollar of accretion is expected to emerge in the third full year of ownership. First year protected by -- mostly protected by a PDR. Second year, breakeven to probably slightly profitable. Full dollar of accretion in the third full year of ownership. Getting the MCR from 92% down to 88% or 89%, getting the 14% G&A ratio down to 9% or 10%.
Justin Lake: Got it. And then lastly, just on, there's a big RP as you know in Florida, I think a lot of anticipation there around when that might be communicated. My understanding is we're kind of into the second round in negotiations. I assume you can't tell us whether you're still kind of in the running there, but any idea given that given where you are today, any idea when you think that under normal conditions that MLR would be announced? Or should the RFP would be announced, not the MLR?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, sure. And we appreciate your sensitivity to the situation. Yeah, we observe the sanctity of all these bidding processes, including the ITN process, so we can't comment specifically on it. But look, as we -- yet we run a nice business in Florida. It's smaller than it used to be to regions. We used to be statewide back in 2017. It runs really well. We're the only four-star plant in Florida. And the same team that works on all our successful bids, our $12 billion of re-procured revenue and our $7 billion of new contract wins, that is the same team that worked on this. So we go into it with a great deal of confidence and we would hope to expand our footprint in Florida. There's $14 billion of Medicaid revenue in Florida regions where we are not currently represented. But let's see how the process plays out and hopefully something will be announced, awards will be announced sometime later this spring.
Justin Lake: Thanks for the color.
Operator: The next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Stephen Baxter: Hi, thanks. I appreciate all the commentary on your Medicaid expectations for the year. I was hoping you could help us think about the bridge from your Medicaid MLR exit in the year to your same-store Medicaid MLR in 2024, around the midpoint of the range. I'm curious if you think that the [core] (ph) could kind of get there earlier in the year because some of the one-one rate adjustments that we've been focused on, or do you think that'll take some time to work through the business and then other seasonal factors play out? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: As a general framework for how we stay within our long-term range year-over-year, in fact, on the same story basis, almost equivalent, we talk about the redetermination process, which late in 2023 began to put pressure on the MLR until rates caught up with it. As Mark commented in his prepared remarks, we know about Medicaid rates on 80% of our revenue for 2024. That rate increase came in at 4%. So that blends to about 3.2%. We forecasted the other 20% at less than half that. So we have a 3.5% rate increase built into our 2024 guidance. And that was exactly commensurate with trend, trend even as influenced by the modest acuity shift that we and our state customers have observed. So pretty much business as usual. There's nothing, no medical cost category that needed to be accounted for or accommodated. It's actuarially sound rates impacted by acuity adjustments that 20 of 21 of our states included. And it was completely in line with our contemplated medical cost trend, even as influenced by an acuity shift. Mark, anything to add?
Mark Keim: No, I think that's exactly right. As we look at the rates and the trend being roughly equal, our legacy book pretty much holds flat. As you know, we're bringing in a bunch of additional new business that puts a little more pressure in the first year, which rounds us out at the 89% that we have in guidance.
Operator: The next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Nathan Rich: Hi, good morning and thanks for the questions. I wanted to ask on the Marketplace MCR, I guess moving back to the low end of the long-term range. So up about 300 basis points year-over-year. Can you just talk about what's driving that increase year-over-year? Is that just a function of the membership growth that you saw? And then have you thought of -- how, I guess, are you thinking about maybe the long-term target for that business? Is 78% to 80% still the right range to use? And then just one clarifying question for Mark. I think you said quarterly EPS is weighted towards the back half of the year. I think usually the back half is about 45% of the total year. So does that mean this year will be over 50% or is that not the right way to interpret the comment that you made? Thank you.
Joe Zubretsky: David, I'll take the Marketplace question first. We were running really well in the middle of the 2023. Our experience was quite positive. So we consciously, consciously bid to grow the business modestly and moderately, as we suggested we would. And so we priced somewhat below the observed trend, not usually below the observed trend, but slightly below the observed trend, to essentially invest some of the excess margin. We earned nearly 10% pre-tax in that business in 2023. So in a sense, we invested some of the excess margin in growth, hence the 31% membership growth and 17% revenue growth. Mark, on the phasing -- quarterly phasing?
Mark Keim: Yeah, absolutely. Nathan, and good morning. Yeah, you got it right. We're normally 55-45 on the front half versus the second half of the year. I'd almost flip that around this year because the dynamics are a little bit different. One, we put on a lot of new business this year. As you can see in our revenue bridge, we got $5.7 billion of new revenue coming into the company, which always comes in just a little bit warmer in the first year, but in the first quarters in particular. So I'm expecting to get some momentum on MLRs in Medicaid and Medicare as we kind of grow into our new footprint there. So that'll change the dynamic a little bit. The other thing is, and I think Joe touched on this, very often, Marketplace has attrition throughout the year such that Marketplace declines during the year. This year is a little bit different. With all the members rolling off on redet and us expecting to pick up our fair share of them in Marketplace as they convert, we'll see a growing book in Marketplace. And as you know, we've got some confidence on the margins given that we really prioritize margin over volume in Marketplace. So for those two reasons, you're going to see a little bit more of a back-end loaded EPS trajectory this year. I think that should address your question.
Nathan Rich: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Sarah James: Thank you. Can you clarify for us what you guys contemplated in for two midnights and V28 into your 2024 plan design and also for Bright? And when you mentioned the pressures that you were seeing on Medicare, you guys didn't flag outpatient or some of the inpatient trends that the rest of the group is seeing. So I wanted to clarify if you are seeing this?
Joe Zubretsky: Hi, Sarah. I'll kick it to Mark for we have very detailed analysis of the changes in the risk adjustment rules and what it meant for our book. In answer to your second question, one of the reasons I articulated earlier the configuration of our book of business being somewhat different than what I call mainstream Medicare Advantage is that we have a low income, high acuity population. Our members are using services from the first day of the year to the last day of the year. They're chronic. They have comorbidities and are polychronic. And so the notion of discretionary utilization means far less to our business based on its mix than it might be to a mainstream population where discretionary or the pedic procedures are being done, screenings are taking place, perhaps, and up demand from the pandemic. In our book of highly chronic patients, high acuity members, that's less of a dynamic. And so the three cost categories that I articulated previously, LTSS hours, high cost drugs, GLP-1s, and the supplemental benefits were really the drivers in our book. Mark, do you want to take the risk adjustment question?
Mark Keim: Sure. And I think, Sarah, it's important, as Joe mentioned, when we talk about Medicare, it's in fact three things. Your probably question is most aimed at the DSNP, or high acuity component of our Medicare, which is a third of the book. Obviously, it's less relevant to MMP. On the two things you mentioned, on the two midnight rule, I've seen a little bit of buzz about that lately, and we're a little bit surprised because it's certainly not new. And many of us have factored this in for quite some time. And what I always remind folks is even though there's a two midnight rule, providers still have to prove medical necessity, so there's really not a big window there for a change in trend or a change in risk adjustment issues as we can see it. On V28, it's got some interesting dynamics. It is certainly a drag in many places for folks, but there's an interesting dynamic around V28 and high acuity. On single-chronic, people use the example of diabetes, where there's diabetes, but there's some other conditions that kind of correlate or are highly associated with diabetes. V28 will be a reduction on risk adjustment for those kind of situations. But when there's polychronics where there's different comorbidities that are in fact quite different than each other, V28 is actually helpful. And in our high acuity chronic book, we actually have many of those polychronics. So we don't quite see the same dynamic that maybe some of the other folks do out there.
Sarah James: That's helpful. And one more clarification if I could, just on your comment with the exchanges, I know you guys are guiding to a really favorable MLR for this year, but is there still a step-up in earnings as you mature this new book? I guess in other words, your year one is still slightly below target range, right, on new members? And then there would be an implied earnings lift as that book moves into the second year of operations?
Joe Zubretsky: I'm not quite sure I've captured the essence of your question, but we are forecasting a 78% MCR for the year, which is at the low end of our long-term target range, which means we'll be operating high single-digit margins, certainly not the 10% pre-tax we achieved in 2023. But look, if you grow the book more aggressively, more of your members are going to be new to the book. And so you have to -- in our view, you have to strike a balance about how fast you're going to grow it and how many new members you want. Every new member that comes in, you need to find risk adjustment. If they come in during SEP, if they're chronic, you better find risk adjustment quickly or they won't get the profitability in the near term. So there's a -- very much a balance between what you get in annual enrollment, what you pick up in SEP, and how one thinks about how fast do I grow the book to achieve mid-single-digit margins when the maturity of the membership and the duration of the membership is pretty important to the stability of the risk pool. You have to balance those two factors.
Sarah James: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
George Hill: Yeah, good morning guys. And I think Nate and Sarah kind of covered everything I wanted to hit on the exchange, but I'll try to bring up one more topic, which is I guess, can you talk about underlying utilization trends and kind of cost growth trends there because it sounds like you guys priced the book for growth in 2024 but the utilization is going to kind of continue to remain low. So I guess I'm trying to parse the spread between utilization trends and price growth for the margin expansion. Kind of any color on that would be helpful?
Mark Keim: And, George, your question is focused on Marketplace?
George Hill: Yeah, Marketplace.
Mark Keim: Yeah, look, as Joe has been very clear, we're prioritizing margin over volume in this business, and the way we do that is we keep it silver, which we believe is the best product for both the member and the payor. But we keep it stable, which means we continue to have really good renewals. As we look at our pricing objectives here, we're putting price into the market to make sure that we can defend reasonable margins here. We did concede a little bit of margin in our pricing for 2024 just because we were well below our target range. Remember our target range is 78% to 80% and we printed something a little bit south of that in ‘23. So there's no reason to leave volume on the table if we can put a little bit of price back, drive some volume and still hit our margin targets. Hope that helps.
George Hill: It does. And maybe if I can just sneak in a quick follow-up. I know it's a tiny piece of the business. Could you talk about kind of the expected disruption in PDP in 2025 given the changes from IRA?
Joe Zubretsky: I'm sorry, we had trouble hearing the last part of your question, George. PDP?
George Hill: Yeah, but like I said, I know it's a tiny part of the business, but we're expecting kind of PDP to be pretty disruptive or disrupted in 2025 because of the IRA changes. I know it's a tiny part of the book, but if you guys have any commentary on what you're saying would be helpful.
Mark Keim: Yeah. So on PDP, as you know, we don't price a PDP product and the IRA or the Inflation Reduction Act, as you're pointing out, is certainly a headwind for that sector, but that's not too relevant to our business, George.
George Hill: Thank you.
Operator: The last question today will come from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Scott Fidel: Thanks. Right before the bell here. I just was interested if you could walk us through your preliminary analysis on the 2025 MA advance notice and whether you're able to parse that down between the legacy business impact and then what you're projecting will be the preliminary impact on the Bright book? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, Scott. I mean, on balance, our view is the same view that you've heard from others, is that the advance notice does not appear to be adequate to compensate for trends that we're all observing. I think in our book, if you take the CMS advance notice and project it to our book, I think we're projecting about a 50 basis point, 0.5 point of rate increase, which we believe is, along with others, is insufficient, and we'll see where the final notice comes out. It usually comes out, as you know, better than that. But our view is not any different from anybody else's.
Mark Keim: Yeah, just to build on that, and a lot of this data is in the public domain at this point. On the effective benchmark rates in the advance notice and then risk or normalization, most folks are seeing across the entire market, the net of those at about zero, right? As Joe mentioned, we see a net of about a positive 50 bps. So we're a little bit better on the benchmark rate, and we're a little bit not so bad on the risk score normalization for some reasons I alluded to earlier. So we're seeing about a 50 BP benefit there, and obviously the rest of STARS impact and what ultimately everyone does with risk scores has yet to play out. But that's our initial point on the legacy book.
Scott Fidel: Thanks. And then just to clarify, so the 50 bps, that's for the overall book, right? And then I would assume that, [directionally] (ph) the legacy book probably better in the Bright book, a little worse than the legacy in that? Is that a fair assumption?
Mark Keim: We're still working our way through that. There will be a couple things going on there. As I mentioned earlier, we're six weeks into owning it. We're working through those issues with the team there. There will also be a bunch of dynamics that happen this year. There are actually two entities there. One is Community Health Plan, and the other one, Brand New Day. There will be some issues between them on exactly how we balance the effects of all this between those two entities. So a little bit of work there and not ready to comment on that one.
Joe Zubretsky: But I would say that we're not anticipating in any analysis when completed on rates that would move us off of achieving the $1 accretion in the third full year of ownership. We're pretty confident in that trajectory.
Scott Fidel: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session and also concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-26 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Molina Healthcare Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Krocheski, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Joe Krocheski: Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare’s third quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina’s President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our third quarter earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those of you who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that all of the remarks made are as of today, Thursday, October 26, 2023, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. On this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our third quarter 2023 earnings release. During the call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, statements regarding our 2023 guidance, Medicaid redeterminations, our recent RFP awards and related revenue growth, our 2024 outlook, our recent acquisitions and M&A activity, our long-term growth strategy and our embedded earnings power and margins. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. That could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report filed with the SEC as well as our risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?
Joe Zubretsky: Thank you, Joe, and good morning. Today, I will provide updates on several topics. Our financial results for the third quarter 2023, our full year 2023 guidance, Medicaid redeterminations, our growth initiatives and our strategy for sustaining profitable growth and our 2024 premium outlook. Let me start with our third quarter performance. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of $5.05 or 16% year-over-year growth on $8.2 billion of premium revenue. Our results reflect the continued execution of our strategy for sustaining profitable growth. Our third quarter 88.7% consolidated MCR and 4.6% adjusted pretax margin demonstrate continued strong medical and operating cost management. Our year-to-date consolidated MCR of 87.8% is squarely in line with our long-term target range and our 5.1% pretax margin is above the high end of the range. We note that investment income continues to bolster our year-over-year earnings growth and already a strong margin profile. Our Medicaid business performed as we expected. Our 88.8% MCR was within our long-term target range. Medical cost trend including the net effect of redetermination acuity shifts in corridors in several states was within our expectations. Medicare’s results came in below our expectations with a reported MCR of 92.4%. In the quarter, we continue to experience higher utilization of outpatient, professional and in-home services, all of which we believe we appropriately addressed in our 2024 bids. And finally, marketplace with a reported MCR of 78.9% continues to perform well. Medical cost trends are in line with our pricing assumptions, and our improved risk adjustment performance is meaningful. Our small silver stable strategy is working. In summary, our third quarter results build on our strong first half performance. Turning now to our 2023 guidance. Based on our third quarter results, we are affirming our full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $20.75 or 16% growth year-over-year, consistent with our long-term earnings per share growth target of 15% to 18%. Our fourth quarter outlook takes full account of our year-to-date performance and considerations for seasonality and conservatism. Now a few words about Medicaid redeterminations. As of July, all our Medicaid states have begun disenrolling members. Despite the redetermination activity, our third quarter Medicaid membership was nearly unchanged from the second quarter. Growth driven by the initiation of the Iowa contract and the closing of the My Choice Wisconsin acquisition offset the $200,000 member decrease from the net impact of redeterminations and new enrollment. While many uncertainties remain on the ultimate impact of redetermination, we now believe it prudent to lower our retention assumption from 50% to 40%. Mark will address implications for revenue and our unchanged outlook for $38 billion in premium revenue for next year in his remarks. Although, the medical cost profile of members who have left the Medicaid roles continues to be more favorable than the portfolio average. When combined with the impact of corridor offsets in several states, our overall Medicaid MCR was within our expectations. Mark will provide more color on redeterminations during his remarks. Turning now to an update on our growth initiatives and our strategy for sustaining profitable growth, beginning with our recent state wins. The implementation of our new California contract, which will nearly double the size of our current membership in the state and add approximately $2 billion in annual premium is proceeding as planned for a January 1, 2024 start date. In July, we finalized our contract for the Texas STAR+ program, retaining our entire existing footprint. With numerous new entrants likely attracting low share, we expect our share of membership in the state to grow, driving incremental annual premium revenue of approximately $400 million. Also in July, we successfully launched our Iowa health plan serving approximately 180,000 members, consistent with our expectations. Our Nebraska implementation is tracking to a successful launch on January 1, 2024, and will contribute estimated annual premium of $600 million. In August, we announced that we will once again be serving Medicaid beneficiaries in the state of New Mexico. We expect the new contract to begin mid-2024 and produce approximately $500 million in annual premium revenue. In Indiana, the state deemed us not to have met the readiness requirements for a Medicaid contract due to our Medicare DSNP product becoming available in the state on January 1, 2025, and not by January 1, 2024, as required. We are proud to have won the initial award as testimony to our proposal skills, but disappointed we did not meet that one readiness requirement. Our growth agenda is in full gear. Even with the development in Indiana and changing assumptions for redetermination retention, all of these new contract wins and reprocurements combined keep us on track to approximately $38 billion of premium revenue in 2024, as previously forecasted. Shifting to our M&A activity. In early September, we announced the closing of the My Choice Wisconsin acquisition. Recall, this transaction adds approximately 40,000 mostly MLTSS members and approximately $1 billion in annual premium revenue. The regulatory approval process for the Bright Medicare acquisition is proceeding as planned. We continue to work with Bright management on satisfying the remaining closing conditions and continue to expect to close by the first quarter of 2024. Now looking ahead to 2024. Assuming a timely close of the Bright Medicare acquisition, we remain confident that all of the known building blocks provide line of sight to approximately $38 billion of premium revenue in 2024, which represents 19% year-over-year growth, even before executing on additional strategic initiatives. While there are many positive earnings catalysts going into next year, which Mark will speak to in a moment. There are also some factors, which has not yet fully developed. As is customary, we will provide our specific earnings guidance with you in February. Recall that at our Investor Day earlier this year, we announced our long-term financial targets, the centerpiece of which is a long-term earnings per share compound annual growth rate of 15% to 18%. With the visibility we have into our earnings trajectory, we are comfortable in reaffirming our commitment to that compound annual growth rate target over the next three years. As always, I would like to thank our management team who worked tirelessly every day to deliver these results. Our team has evolved to keep pace with our growth and to execute each stage of our strategy. Recall that most recently, we promoted both Jim Woys and Mark Keim to the position of Senior Executive Vice President with Jim adding the title of Chief Operating Officer. In further shaping our lineup under Jim and Mark, two Molina veterans, Executive Vice President, Deb Bacon; and Dave Reynolds will now lead our flagship Medicaid business. We are also adding additional management talent in our Medicare and Marketplace businesses and scaling up our integration platform, all to support our substantial growth. Marc Russo will be leaving the company with our thanks for his service. Not only our executive team, but all of our colleagues throughout the enterprise and across the nation are vital to our success. I want to extend my special thanks to our nearly 18,000 associates who are dedicated to deliver access to high quality healthcare to our members. It is my privilege to serve with such a committed and capable group of professionals. In summary, we are very pleased with our performance this quarter. We have maintained our attractive margin profile during this unprecedented industry-wide redetermination process, while continuing to generate double digit growth. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark?
Mark Keim: Thanks, Joe, and good morning everyone. Today I’ll discuss some additional details of our third quarter performance, the balance sheet and our 2023 guidance and embedded earnings. I’ll also provide an update on redeterminations, our 2024 premium revenue outlook and some early thoughts on the drivers of 2024 earnings. Beginning with our third quarter results. For the quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.05 and a consolidated MCR of 88.7%. In Medicaid, our reported MCR was 88.8%. The MCR included a moderate impact from the net effect of redetermination acuity shifts and corridors in several states. Our third quarter MCR was also slightly elevated from a provisional retroactive rate adjustment in New York State. Across our Medicaid segment, the major medical cost categories were largely in line with our expectation and normal quarter-to-quarter trend fluctuations. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 92.4%, above our long-term target range. During the quarter, we saw a continuation of increased utilization of outpatient professional and in-home services. Recall, we observed these trends emerging in the first and second quarters in time to inform our 2024 bids and benefit design. We are confident our 2024 bids will produce target margins next year. In Marketplace, our reported MCR was 78.9%. This strong result reflects our pricing strategy to return this business to target margins. Our enhanced focus on silver and renewal members helps us to drive strong performance and risk adjustment. Based on our year-to-date performance, we are well positioned to exceed our mid-single-digit target margins for the year. Also in Marketplace, we recorded a non-recurring charge in the quarter on our Texas Marketplace risk adjustment receivable from 2022 due to the financial difficulties of one major program participant in that state. While we have made our best estimate of the shortfall in collections, we will continue to pursue regulatory paths to collecting the full receivable due to us. Given it’s unusual and one-time nature, we have excluded it from our adjusted earnings. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 7.1 consistent with our expectations. This result includes new business implementation spending for new contract wins in Iowa, as well as several new contracts beginning in 2024. Turning now to our balance sheet. Our capital foundation remains strong. We harvested approximately $175 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter and used a similar amount for our Wisconsin acquisition leaving our parent company cash balance unchanged quarter-over-quarter at approximately $0.5 billion. Debt at the end of the quarter was unchanged at just 1.6x trailing 12 month EBITDA with our debt-to-cap ratio at 38.3%. Net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.3x and 33.2% reflecting our low leverage position and ample cash and capital capacity for additional growth and investment. Turning to reserves. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and we continue to be confident in the strength of our reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 51, elevated from normal levels due to the inclusion of My Choice Wisconsin and our new Iowa plan. Adjusted for this temporary impact, our reported DCP would have been consistent with Q1 and Q2 levels. Now some additional color on our 2023 guidance and embedded earnings. We’re affirming our full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $20.75. Our full year guidance now effectively the remaining fourth quarter reflects our third quarter results, which were largely consistent with our expectations and includes considerations for seasonality and conservatism. New store embedded earnings remains unchanged at $5.50 per share, comprised of $4 for our recent new contract wins and $1.50 for acquisitions. The $4 per share for our new contract wins now includes approximately $0.50 for the combination of Texas STAR+PLUS and New Mexico replacing the same amount previously expected from the Indiana contract. The $1.50 per share of acquisition earnings includes achieving full run rate accretion from AgeWell, My Choice and Bright Health’s Medicare business. Turning to redeterminations. As we discussed on prior calls, we have built robust tracking and monitoring systems to maximize retention of members who meet the eligibility criteria and to also promptly understand any financial impacts of redeterminations. Across our states approximately one-third of our members reviewed have been termed, of which over 70% have been procedural disenrollment rather than due to verification of actual ineligibility. As a result, we are seeing nearly 30% of those termed being reconnected, and we expect these numbers to grow. In the quarter, we estimate that we lost approximately 200,000 members due to the net impact of redeterminations bringing the year-to-date figure to approximately 300,000. Given the high number of procedural terminations and increasing state and CMS interventions, we expect reconnects will likely continue decreasing currently reported membership losses. As we interact with members who lose eligibility, we seek to warm transfer them to our Marketplace team for potential enrollment in that product. Throughout the process, we are seeing an increasing rate of former Medicaid members, both ours and our competitors enroll in our Marketplace products. Turning to our observations on the margin impact of redeterminations. We see that terminated members have lower medical costs than the portfolio average. However, combined with the impact of corridors in several states, the net effects from acuity shifts remains well within our expectations and our overall MCR outlook for the year. Of course, as trends have emerged, we are working with our state partners to ensure rates reflect the impact of redeterminations either prospectively in the normal fiscal year rate cycle, off cycle or retrospectively if necessary. In our states through the end of September 10 of 12 with draft or final rates have included an acuity adjustment with several considering retroactive or mid-cycle adjustments. Lastly, some additional color on 2024 starting with our premium revenue outlook. As Joe mentioned, we have line of sight to the building blocks that are expected to deliver approximately $38 billion in premium revenue for 2024 or approximately 19% growth off our 2023 premium guidance of $32 billion. These building blocks include $1.1 billion of organic growth in our current footprint, plus approximately $4 billion from our recent state contract wins with the expected premium from our Texas STAR+PLUS and New Mexico contracts, largely replacing the approximately $500 million that we had previously projected from Indiana next year. This we add approximately $2.4 billion of acquisition related premium consisting of [Audio Dip] of My Choice Wisconsin and the Bright California Medicare acquisition. Partially offsetting these growth drivers is $1.6 billion for the impact of redeterminations and known pharmacy carve-outs. We have revised our original 50% retention assumption to 40% reflecting the earlier redetermination activity we have seen and a generally conservative approach to forecasting. While this changing assumption will lower 2024 premium revenue by $300 million, we expect that gains in marketplace through increasing cross-sell and SEP and an expected strong OEP will effectively offset this result. We maintain our $38 billion in premium revenue outlook for 2024. Finally, some early thoughts on the drivers of 2024 earnings. We note the following elements that will positively influence our 2024 earnings trajectory. We have a solid 2023 earnings baseline off of which to grow. Our new store embedded earnings remain unchanged at $5.50 and continue to provide meaningful visibility into our future earnings growth potential. Investment income will likely continue to be strong. We believe our Medicare performance will improve as a result of our 2024 bids. And the impact of new business implementation costs of $0.75 a share this year go away as we begin recording premium revenue on our new business wins. However, there are some remaining variables as we close 2023 and move into 2024. First, our 2024 outlook will be better informed with another quarter of redetermination activity observed. Second, rates impacting 60% of our 2024 Medicaid premium revenue are still unknown, but we are confident that the principle of actuarial soundness will prevail, including appropriate acuity adjustments for redeterminations. We do note that rates have been finalized to date have generally been satisfactory. Finally, the first year earnings contribution from the Bright acquisition is still under review. In summary, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance and the momentum we have established toward achieving our growth targets. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Josh Raskin: Thanks. Good morning. I want to pick up on that last thread around the exchange growth from the redeterminations and what you’re seeing early. I’m curious in terms of trends and members coming in. And then is it fair to assume that that would be better risk? They’re coming into your product and they’ve probably been previously insured, right, coming out of Medicaid? And then I’m just curious if this early experience, I understand a little less retention, does that change your view of the exchanges in 2024? I think last quarter you said that they would be relatively low growth in terms of premiums for 2024.
Joe Zubretsky: Josh, when it comes to the exchange business in the special enrollment period, we are seeing an increase in special enrollment, monthly special enrollment. It was averaging 8,000 to 9,000 a month until the redetermination process happened, and it’s increased to 12,000 a month and growing. So we are getting membership flow into the Marketplace from Medicaid redeterminations, not only from our book of business, but from competitors’ book of business. We do have a product and every place we have a Medicaid footprint. But in many cases that product isn’t as competitive – competitively priced as competitors. So where we’re competitively priced we’re getting Medicaid membership from other competitors, and we’re getting Medicaid – Marketplace membership from our own book of business. So we’re pretty pleased that we did not forecast Marketplace membership growth. We continued it upside to our membership case and we’re seeing a nice result there. Mark, anything to add?
Mark Keim: Sure. Josh, I added about 40,000 members through SEP in the quarter compared to the 200,000 net we lost in Medicaid. So if you put some conversion rate on how many of the 40,000 came from our Medicaid book or someone else’s Medicaid book, that conversion rate is pretty good. Call it, 15% or 20%. On the rate that they’re coming in at, it looks like they’re coming in pretty much at our portfolio run rate within Marketplace. We’re not seeing pent-up demand or anything like that. So we’re liking the pickup and the implications for future volume and those margins, so far are looking pretty good to us.
Joe Zubretsky: The second part of your question, Josh, you asked about the retention percentage. We just followed the data and with 300,000 membership losses to date, the first thing we say is it’s ill-advised to extrapolate any current result. Many of our states front loaded the process and by front loading we mean they specifically targeted members more likely to lose eligibility. And the fact that 70% of the terminations were procedural means that the reconnect rate has been high averaging 25% and now moving to 30% of those members who have lost eligibility. So we just followed the data and we originally said we would lose 400,000 of the 800,000 members we gained during the pandemic, and now that number has increased to 480,000. And I suppose that would mean that it is likely that whatever we’re seeing in terms of Marketplace pickup would likely increase as well.
Josh Raskin: Perfect. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Kevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. I guess two questions. One, within the Medicaid business as you talked about how MLR is coming in line with expectations seems like every time we do that, you also mentioned that net of risk corridors and things like that. Is there any way to quantify what the pressure would’ve been without the offset of risk corridors? And then as far as the MA commentary, it sounds like you’re saying Q3 came in worse, but you still caught it in time for your bid. So I’m trying to figure out how MLR in Q3 could be higher than expectations, but not be a problem for 2024 if you submitted bids in June? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: On the Medicaid MLR, I’ll kick it to Mark here for more color. But as we’ve always said and we made a big point of this at Investor Day. On the pre-COVID minimum MLRs and corridors that set sort of an industry benchmark of medical margin performance. We have routinely outperformed those benchmarks, which gives rise to a payback to the state in the form of a liability in many of our states. And some of those corridors we’re deep into them, meaning that we’re in the 100% tier. So with that having been said, if performance deteriorates during the year for any reason, whether it’s an acuity shift for redetermination, whether it’s a trend inflection, whether it’s flu or COVID for whatever reason that liability acts as sort of the first financial cushion to absorb it before rates pick up, meaning the acuity adjustments, trend assumptions, always being baked into rates, fulfilling the concept of actuarial soundness. And we’ve said that from the beginning of this process that this is developing exactly as planned. We knew there’d be an acuity shift, manageable and modest as it is, and would put pressure on the underlying MCR. Our corridor liabilities would act as the first point of financial cushion until the rate process takes full credit of the acuity shift and trend. And that’s exactly what’s happening today.
Mark Keim: Right. And just to put a little color around that. If in normal times you’re booking corridor expense and underlying trend increases quarter-to-quarter in our situation, I’ll just book less corridor expense. But it is important to note, I still booked meaningful corridor expense in the third quarter. So it’s not like the corridors have completely been offset. We’re still booking corridor expense and we still have a significant ultimate on those liabilities. Now, as Joe mentioned that corridor works well in the current fiscal year and that it’s about the new rate cycle. But remember, we tend to be best-in-class margins, which means that new rate cycle always works for us and replenishes our corridor position and keeps us in the mode we’re currently running.
Joe Zubretsky: Kevin, the second part of your question was on the Medicare MCR, which admittedly ran hot in the quarter at 92.4% and was running in the high 80s earlier in the year. We’re still on target to produce 2.5% to 3% pre-tax margins in that business. It should be twice that, our target is 5% to 6% pre-tax. And yes, we saw some trend inflections in the third quarter that were higher than we observed in the first part of the year. But we’re conservative pricers. We caught some of these trends early in the year, whether outpatient, professional services, screenings and PCP visits are back both on the medical side and on the behavioral side. And LTSS hours, the hours assigned to the frail members who are getting in-home services increased slightly in the quarter. All in, we believe we captured a conservative view of medical cost trend, which right now is running at 7% year-over-year higher than we had expected, but we believe we’ve captured that in our 2024 bids and fully expect our Medicare business to be back to 5% to 6% pre-tax margins in 2024.
Kevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Nathan Rich: Great. Good morning. Thanks for the questions and thanks for the detail on the earnings drivers for next year. Joe, I think you kind of framed the 15% to 18% EPS growth is the average over the next three years. I guess, could you maybe just go into a little bit more detail on sort of the biggest unknowns from your point of view on that could impact growth next year relative to that that 15% to 18% range? And then just a quick clarification, on the retroactive rate adjustment in New York is it possible to quantify what impact that had in the quarter? And do you see a potential for an adjustment to this going forward potentially to be more favorable? Thank you.
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, Nathan. I’ll provide the framing and then kick it to Mark. And I think Mark gave some of the building blocks in his prepared remarks. First and foremost, we’re very confident in the $38 billion revenue outlook for next year. That’s 19% year-over-year growth in a year where we’re still producing best-in-class margins. First, I would say we’re starting with a very high quality solid 2023 earnings baseline. We generally grow organically in our footprint, embedded earnings of $5.50 a share of both new store, both M&A and new contract wins is certainly a catalyst into next year. Those implementation costs of $0.75 reverse. We believe interest rates will continue to be high. Bear in mind that half our investible base is in intermediate term bonds, so they’re locked in, and then the rates on the short-term portfolio are going to fluctuate with what the Fed does. But our outlook there is that interest rates will remain high going into next year, even to the end of next year. The three variables that we need to see more of before giving a specific earnings per share forecast for 2024 is how does redetermination experience emerge in the fourth quarter? To date, it has been completely in line with our expectation. We did increase our ultimate loss assumption as spoken. And we’d like to see how the rates develop on our 60% of our Medicaid revenue for next year. We know about rates on 40% of our Medicaid revenue next year. Those rates have been actuarially sound. We’ve been satisfied with the acuity adjustments. As Mark said, those acuity adjustments were resident in 10 out of the 12 rates that we already know about. But we want to see how the rates develop on 60% of the book. So those are the variables going into next year. As you cited at the beginning of your question, we are confident and committed to the 15% to 18% long-term earnings per share growth rate off the 2023 baseline, which means that 2026 earnings per share will be 52% to 64% higher than 2023 of $20.75. Mark, anything to add?
Mark Keim: Yeah, the only other thing Nathan, I think you asked about the rate adjustment in New York. We reported as you know an 88.8% in Medicaid for the quarter. I’d estimate someplace around 30 bps is related to that specific phenomenon. And the reason it’s a little uncertain is in several of our states the retro rates constantly get revisited. I’m optimistic that this one gets a little bit better, but at the moment we book that adjustment.
Nathan Rich: Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Justin Lake: Good morning. Sorry about that. Appreciate the question here. The – two things I wanted to touch on were – you had a fair amount of prior year development in the third quarter kind of abnormally high relative to previous. Just curious what segments of the business might have drove that and the potential impact to earnings there. And then secondly on, Joe, you mentioned investment income. I’m curious as you’re having these conversations with the states on rates. Just want to confirm, like historically my understanding is states didn’t really take when they set your margin – your rates actuarially sound with a margin target behind it. That margin target was before investment income. Are they looking at investment income and say, geez, maybe we could pay you a little bit less because your earnings are higher because of the investment income? Or is that still left outside of the calculation? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: I’ll answer the second question first. Investment income is not only generally, but almost entirely outside the conversation of rates, which generally focused on what we call medical margin or trend assumptions. In some cases they also focus on a G&A load, but that’s rare and infrequent. On the PYD, I’ll kick it to Mark because we’re very confident in the strength of our balance sheet. Two points I’ll make. From a business perspective, our payment integrity routines are both prepay and postpay. In a postpay routine where you identify things that you should not have paid for and recover it from providers. By definition, that is accounted for in prior period development because it relates to prior periods. That is a large share of any prior period development that we report. Second point to note is, don’t forget, we have corridor liabilities relating to some of these prior periods. And to the extent that PYD went against a state in a period where a corridor liability existed, then it was muted in terms of its financial impact.
Mark Keim: That that’s exactly right, payment integrity has become such a fundamental part of our operations and we do it fairly well. That prior year amount that you pulled from the earnings release was largely offset by corridors. Now, more to the point when we see strong prior period development, it’s tempting to be concerned about current reserving. Did they somehow offset to make earnings, something like that? Look, I’d point to the strength of our current reserve position, 51 days, DCP the growth versus revenue. So I feel both good about our current reserving position, but the strength of this prior year exercise as well through our payment integrity function.
Operator: Our next question comes from Calvin Sternick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Calvin Sternick: Yes. Thanks. Maybe just switching gears here a little bit. I’m curious what you’re seeing in the cohort of members who haven’t reconnected within that 90 to 120 day window, but realize afterwards that they’re still eligible for Medicaid. What are the membership additions looking like there relative to what you expected? And I know you’ve talked about in the past investing in quality initiatives to move up in the auto sign algorithms. So just wondering if you’re seeing those efforts bear fruit here or if it’s still too early to tell or just too much noise going on with redeterminations?
Joe Zubretsky: I think you answered the question in your last statement. Because the gap is 90 to 120 days, we’ve seen very little of it, given that the redetermination was in full throws, May and June. But your supposition – your theoretical supposition is correct. That member is going to go to the doctor or to the pharmacy for a service or a script realize they don’t have service and then reconnect obviously with no retroactivity back to the data termination. So we suspect that member will come back in somewhere around the portfolio average because they’ll be requiring services. Anything to add Mark?
Mark Keim: Yes. When we talk about reconnect, just to set the stage for everybody, we tend to think about two categories, most of them are what we call seamless that is within 90 to 120 days, they realized they lost coverage, contacted the agency and got back on as though they never lost coverage and we pick up the retro premium. Now as Joe mentioned, we’re only three, four, five months into this dynamic. So the people that are outside the 90 to 120 day window are only starting to emerge now. We call those reconnects with a gap. They will come in through the typical auto assign process. And through a number of algorithms, we’re getting better and better on auto-assigns in states. So I feel good about our recapture of those reconnects with the gap.
Calvin Sternick: Thanks. If I can just ask a follow-up, and I apologize if I asked this is nitpicking a little bit, but you said the rates are generally satisfactory. Was that just a hedge against New York, maybe coming in a little bit lower? Just curious what you’re seeing on the rest of the book if some things are generally better, in line or if you have something on the other side that aren’t as good as you expected. Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: I think we use the word generally, obviously, because we were reporting a retroactive rate that not only us but the entire industry is advocating a guest. So that was the reason for the term. But for the most part, about 40% of rates that we know about that impact 40% of our revenue for 2024 in the Medicaid business, the rates have been actuarially sound and have included what we consider to be actuarially reasonable adjustments for acuity.
Calvin Sternick: Great, thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Stephen Baxter: Yes, hi, thanks for the question. I just wanted to come back to the acuity discussion. I think you mentioned it was running in line with your expectations at this point. I guess, how do you think about the higher level of procedural disenrollments, having impacted that? I guess like how much does that make it challenging for you to feel like you have good visibility there at this point? And then I think you mentioned that the reconnect population you expected, the MLRs there will be in line with sort of like the rest of the stayers. I guess, do you have data at this point to support that? Or can you look back and see what utilizations look like over the past couple of years for those people. So I’m just wondering if that’s based on data at this point or it’s still kind of a working period? Thank you.
Mark Keim: So on the reconnects themselves, we’re seeing them come back in closer to the stayers average, the portfolio average. Now I appreciate your question about historical benchmarks of data, but the problem is over the last two to three years, we didn’t really have such a phenomena. But I am feeling pretty good about the MLR of these reconnects, both seamless and with the gap.
Joe Zubretsky: The other – maybe the last point to make on this point is a really important one. Durational acuity and lever stayers and joiners is not a new phenomenon to tracking a book of business. It’s just that in this environment, it’s more important to track it and to be able to forecast it. People come in to Medicaid because they need services, they can end higher than the portfolio average. And by the time they leave, they’re using fewer services and leaving out lower than the portfolio average. That’s the way the business works. And we have produced through all of that, on average, 88% – between 88% and 89%, 88.5% on average MCR. That’s the way the business works. The issue here is because of the redetermination pause during the PHE, there’s twice as many people leaving than joining. So this has always been a phenomenon. We’ve had tracking mechanisms for durational acuity. We understand the levers, stayers and joiners analysis really well. But it is very early in the process. And I come back to the point we made earlier. It is ill-advised to mathematically extrapolate any of these data points, certain states front-loaded the process. And as you suggested, with the procedural termination rate being so high, the reconnect rate is higher than anybody expected and likely growing.
Operator: Next question comes from Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead.
Scott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Would appreciate if you can just give us sort of, I guess, your sense on your comfort levels right now with the current performance and then the bid positioning of the Bright Medicare asset that you’re going to be acquiring. And maybe just sort of talk about how you’re thinking about sort of factoring that into your 2024 outlook and maybe some of the downside protections that exist if that performance does come in, let’s say, a bit meaningfully below optimal levels. Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: So Scott, we’re very pleased with the strategic complement to our Medicare business, taking it from a $4 billion business to nearly a $6 billion business in a very important state for us, obviously, in California, where we’re doubling the size of our Medicaid business. So from a strategic rationale perspective, we’re very excited about it. In our embedded earnings is a run rate accretion level of $1 of earnings per share, ultimately, given the way the CMS pricing cycle works, it is going to take us a little longer than normal to get there, but we’re confident in doing so. I’ll stop short on commenting about their financial performance. They’re a public company. This is a material to their operations. So I would allow them to report on how they’re doing. But we do have visibility into how they’re performing. And when we said that one of the variables going into next year is how will it perform in the first year. We don’t yet know because we don’t know where it will be performing when we close on it. I’ll stop short of commenting on their performance because that would be inappropriate. Obviously, they’ll report earnings soon, and you can get a view as to how the Medicare business is doing.
Operator: Our next question next question comes from A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead.
A.J. Rice: Just maybe to ask about the exchanges a bit more. It sounds like you’ve got some conservatism, at least you believe you have in the fourth quarter baked in. I know you’ve been running a pretty low MCR year-to-date and exchanges. Are you allowing for significant uptick? Sometimes we see that utilization. Obviously, as people hit their deductible limits, et cetera, and exchanges. Can you give us any sense of what you’ve baked in? And I think the comment was made and as you look ahead to 2024, you’re not expecting a lot of premium growth, it seems like you’ve repriced the business pretty well. Why not take a little more active approach to growing that product line next year, given it sounds like you’re hitting your margin targets pretty easily this year in that product? Or maybe I’m missing something.
Joe Zubretsky: So yes, you aren’t missing anything. Thanks for the question. Let me frame it in terms of you asked two questions, one about the MCR and one about membership growth. On the MCR, when we gave guidance at the end of the second quarter, we built in roughly an 85% back half MCR. And obviously, we outperformed that in the third quarter. We continue to bake in something in the mid-80s for the fourth quarter, which would put us at 76% for the full year, which is 200 basis points below the low end of the range. This business is going to produce 8.5% to 9% pretax margins for the year. Small, silver and stable work given the potential for inherent volatility in the risk pool, I think we have this right. Now to your point, Mark mentioned it in his prepared remarks and some, but he mentioned it, that we do plan to grow the marketplace business next year. We plan to grow it measuredly and modestly. The early read on our pricing competitiveness. I’ll just give you one stat that’s really important. In our Silver product, which is our flagship product, we are now number one or number two priced in 30% of our counties versus 20% this year. It will grow next year. We plan to do it measurably and modestly, all with the view are producing at least mid-single-digit pretax margins, which this year will be very high single-digit pretax margins. Anything to add Mark?
Mark Keim: A.J., the only thing I’d add is Joe has been adamant about small, stable and silver in this product. And so when we set rates last June, we set them on our discipline on our margin expectations. It looks like the risk pool next year is stabilizing with some of the more strangely players dropping out, which means the risk pool for the rest of us has stabilized as a result on pricing we committed to last June, we’re seeing a much better competitive position. Joe mentioned 20% of our county is now growing to 30%, where we’re number one or number two, which means I’m expecting to get more volume than I thought before at margins that conform with our discipline. So we’re feeling good about that outlook.
A.J. Rice: Okay, thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
George Hill: Hey, good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. I guess with respect to the retrospective rate adjustments that you guys talked about, is there any way to quantify both how far you guys are through the process? And simplistically speaking, I guess, how much money you guys think you might be owed from rate adjustments that kind of didn’t – that need to be trued up historically?
Mark Keim: I’ll take that. Obviously, I’m in no position to comment on retro rates that haven’t been contractually committed to by our state partners. But with our actuarial team and our data-driven process, we’re in there working with them. And I’d say there’s a handful right now where the data is compelling. The state is receptive to the discussion. We’ll let that play out. And of course, I’ll book those benefits if and when they come.
George Hill: Okay, thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Gary Taylor from Cowen. Please go ahead.
Gary Taylor: Hi, good morning. I had two questions. One was just on the $5.50 of embedded earnings, which I think you reiterated I think a portion of that historically was Indiana that might have only been sort of $0.15 or $0.20. So I just wanted to make sure understanding what sort of backfilling that to keep the embedded earnings at $5.50. And also, if you would agree, it sounds like maybe just the Bright year one profitability is the biggest I guess, question mark right now in terms of how much of that embedded earnings will get realized in 2024. Is that fair?
Joe Zubretsky: First question, Gary, this is Joe. Yes, as embedded earnings, you’re absolutely right. We removed Indiana from embedded earnings but replaced it with New Mexico and an expansion in Texas now that the contract is finalized. And yes, as I said, we’re very confident that we can get Bright to target margins after a two-year period and achieve the $1 earnings per share accretion number. And again, we’re just saying that we just don’t know what we’re going to inherit in terms of earnings per share closing to forecast the first year.
Mark Keim: And given that company is going into OEP themselves, they’re probably still working through what their outlook is for next year. So it’s definitely too early given the situation for us to comment on that one.
Gary Taylor: Thank you.
Operator: The last question comes from Sarah James from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Sarah James: Thank you. One clarification on the rejoiners, can you give us a split of what’s coming back in exchanges versus coming back on Medicaid? And then in the two of the 12 states that didn’t put in the acuity adjustments, are you able to see any pattern there, either in how the cost that is coming in, maybe the timing that they started redeterminations or how the rate is structured with risk corridors that you’re able to determine maybe why those two were outliers?
Joe Zubretsky: I’ll kick it to Mark for the cover on these, but the first point I’ll make is on your second question. I think we appropriately need to include the word yet in the two that haven’t. Bear in mind, some of our rate cycle actually incepts only as the redetermination process starting even before it started, which makes it not possible for any Medicaid department to project what the acuity shift would be. So I would introduce the word yet. And who knows, maybe we’ll get a retro or a mid-cycle adjustment on those two states. Mark?
Mark Keim: Hey Sarah, on the reconnects, when we use the term reconnects, both seamless and with a gap, that is purely a Medicaid concept. So that 25% going to 30% that we’re seeing is strictly within Medicaid – then separately, as I mentioned earlier, we’re picking up members in the marketplace. I mentioned closer to 40,000 through SEP in the third quarter. So that would be a different concept. And obviously, as an enterprise, only helps – in the overall membership story. And then Joe is exactly right, on the two of the 12 states where we haven’t seen it yet, there’s a few things driving that. The timing of when folks started impacts how quickly data develops to have a data-driven process. The timing of the fiscal year is definitely a component, but in all cases, the concept of actuarial sales just means it’s a matter of getting the data into timing consistent with fiscal years and appropriate retro periods. So we feel good about that process. And again, the vast majority have already given us those concessions. So we feel good about how the process will unfold.
Sarah James: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-27 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Molina Healthcare Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today’s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Krocheski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Joe Krocheski: Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare’s second quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina’s President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our second quarter earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made are as of today, Thursday, July 27, 2023, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. On this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our second quarter 2023 earnings release. During our call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our 2023 guidance, Medicaid redeterminations, our recent RFP awards and related revenue growth, our recent acquisitions and M&A activity, our long-term growth strategy and our embedded earnings power and margins. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report filed with the SEC as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?
Joe Zubretsky: Thank you, Joe, and good morning. Today we will provide updates on our financial results for the second quarter 2023, our full year 2023 guidance in the context of our second quarter results, Medicaid redeterminations and our growth initiatives, and our strategy for sustaining profitable growth, including our 2024 premium revenue growth drivers. Let me begin with the second quarter highlights. Last night, we’ve reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of $5.65, or 24% year-over-year growth on $8 billion of premium revenue. Our 87.5% consolidated MCR in the second quarter demonstrates continued strong operating performance in medical cost management and was at the low end of our long-term target range. We produced a 5.3% adjusted pre-tax margin or 3.9% after tax, a very strong result that was above the high end of our long-term target range. Year-to-date, our consolidated MCR is 87.3% and our adjusted pre-tax margin is 5.4%. We note that investment income produced higher than expected results due to the increasing yield environment. In the second quarter, we continued to generate excellent margins in our Medicaid business with an MCR of 88.3%, bringing our year-to-date MCR to 88.4%. This result was in line with our full year guidance and long-term target range. As expected, the medical cost impact of redeterminations was negligible, although we are in the very early stages of that process. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 89.2%, which is above the high end of our long-term target range. We are experiencing some cost, pressure and professional and outpatient services and higher first year MCRs associated with growth. With a year-to-date Medicare MCR of 88.6%, the book of business continues to produce attractive margins. In Marketplace, our reported MCR was 73.7% for the quarter and 71.2% year-to-date. This result reflects the successful implementation of our pricing, metallic mix, and membership continuity strategies to restore this business to mid-single-digit target margins. In summary, our second quarter results built on our strong start to the year. Medicaid, our flagship business representing over 80% of revenue continues to produce strong, predictable operating results and cash flows. Our high acuity Medicare niche serving low-income members continues to grow organically and our Marketplace business is now well positioned to achieve target margins. Turning now to our 2023 guidance. Based on our strong second quarter results, we are increasing our full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.50 per share to at least $20.75 or 16% growth year-over-year. Consistent with our long-term earnings per share growth target of 15% to 18%. Our earnings per share guidance is now $1 per diluted share higher than our initial guidance issued in February. Our pre-tax margins are exceeding our expectations. The Medicaid MCR is right on target, Medicare slightly behind target and marketplace substantially better. We note that these target ratios produce best in industry margins. Then of course, the interest rate environment has allowed us to produce investment income that has provided a short term earnings boost. Now, a few words on Medicaid redeterminations. During the second quarter, all but four of our states began disenrolling members with the remaining states initiating disenrollments on July 1. Our Medicaid membership declined by 93,000 members during the quarter, which was well within our expectations. Although the medical cost profile of members who have left is slightly more favorable than the portfolio average, the impact on our overall Medicaid MCR was negligible and within our expectations. We continued our outreach to members to minimize procedural disenrollment. We also continued to work with our state partners to ensure rates remain actuarially sound to account for any potential shifts in acuity. To date, all of our states have expressed a willingness to adjust rates as needed to account for any changes in acuity or trend. Mark will provide more color on redetermination during his remarks. Turning now to an update on our growth strategy. At our May Investor conference, we laid out our strategy for sustaining profitable growth. We plan to grow premiums at 13% to 15% through a combination of growth in our current footprint, strategic initiatives and accretive acquisitions. We also established a 2026 premium revenue target of $46 billion. We already have significant momentum toward achieving these growth goals. Our five recent state RFP wins drive more than $5 billion in incremental premium revenue. A portion of this incremental revenue is included in our 2023 guidance attributable to our Iowa contract, which we successfully launched July 1 with approximately 200,000 members consistent with our expectations. Most of the remainder emerges in our 2024 revenue outlook and a small component in 2025. We are also executing on the M&A component of our growth strategy consistent with our strategy of acquiring capitated government-sponsored assets. In June, we announced the acquisition of Bright HealthCare’s California Medicare Business for an attractive purchase price of approximately 28% of expected 2023 premium revenue. Bright’s Medicare business serves approximately 125,000 MAPD, D-SNP and C-SNP members across 23 counties in California with 60% membership overlap with Molina’s Medicaid footprint. We expect the transaction to add approximately $1.8 billion of premium revenue, deliver $1 of adjusted earnings per share at full run rate, but no earnings contribution in the first full year of ownership. We expect the transaction to close by the first quarter of 2024. The closing is subject to the solvency and continued operation as a going concern of Bright Health Group throughout the pre-closing period, as well as federal and state regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. Based on known building blocks, we now have line of sight to approximately $38 billion of premium revenue in 2024 or 19% growth before executing on additional strategic initiatives. Our new store embedded earnings is now $5.50 per share, providing meaningful visibility into our future earnings growth potential. We see additional embedded earnings upside if and when the several remaining COVID era corridors are eliminated. Two short months ago at our Investor Day, we reaffirmed our long-term financial targets, the centerpiece of which is the long-term earnings per share annual growth rate of 15% to 18%. Our performance this quarter supports that outlook. The revenue base and new store earnings profile continue to build with highly accretive new contract wins and M&A. Our second quarter and year-to-date operating results provide a very solid earnings base off of which to grow, and we have seen nothing in the early stages of the Medicaid redetermination process that changes our view of the earnings trajectory of the business. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark?
Mark Keim: Thanks, Joe, and good morning everyone. Today, I will discuss some additional details of our second quarter performance, the balance sheet, some thoughts on our 2023 guidance, including an update on redeterminations and our 2024 premium revenue outlook. Beginning with our second quarter results, our consolidated MCR for the second quarter was 87.5%, reflecting continued strong medical cost management. In Medicaid, our reported MCR was 88.3%, a strong result that was in line with our expectations and long-term target range. The major medical cost categories were largely in line with our expectation and normal quarter-to-quarter trend fluctuations and COVID-related costs have largely subsided. Second quarter Medicaid membership is down 93,000 from the first quarter, largely attributable to the expected initial impact of redeterminations. In Medicare our reported MCR was 89.2%, which is above our long-term target range. During the quarter, we saw increased utilization of outpatient and professional services, as well as the continuing expected impact from strong growth in our D-SNP and MAPD products, due to the normal lag in new member margins. We make note of two key dynamics of our year-to-date Medicare performance and implications for 2024 bids. First, our MMP block of business representing half of our Medicare premium is not tied to annual Medicare bid process. And second, we were conservative in our trend assumptions in our 2024 bid process. In Marketplace, our reported MCR was 73.7%. This strong result reflects our pricing strategy to return this business to target margins prior year risk adjustment true up benefiting the quarter, as well as normal seasonal patterns for utilization. We call our pricing strategy increased our premium yield by approximately 9% this year, and with three quarters of our book in renewing members and two-thirds in silver metallic products, our risk scores should be appropriately valued. We feel well positioned to achieve our mid-single-digit target margins in this business for the year. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 7.4% and includes the expected new business implementation spending, ahead of new contract wins incepting in July and next year. Turning now to our balance sheet. Our capital foundation remains strong. We harvested approximately $150 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, and our parent company cash balance was approximately $0.5 a billion. We expect to fund the acquisition of Bright HealthCare’s Medicare business in the first quarter of 2024 with cash on hand. Debt at the end of the quarter was unchanged at just 1.6 times trailing 12 month EBITDA with our debt to cap ratio at 40%. Net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.3 times and 35% reflecting our low leverage position and ample cash and capital capacity for additional growth and investment. Turning to reserves. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and we continue to be confident in the strength of our reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 47. Now some additional color on our 2023 guidance. We increased our 2023 adjusted earnings guidance by $0.50 to at least $20.75 per share. This increase is driven by second quarter operating and investment income performance above our expectations and higher expected investment income in the second half of the year, partially offset by some continued conservatism. As Joe mentioned, our current new store embedded earnings are $5.50 per share, comprised of $4 per share for our recent new contract wins in California, Iowa, Nebraska, and Indiana, plus a $1.50 [ph] per share for the acquisitions of AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin and now the recently announced acquisition of Bright Health’s Medicare business, all achieving their full run rate accretion. Elimination of the remaining COVID era with corridors would provide upside to the $5.50 of new store embedded earnings. Turning to redeterminations. While the redetermination process differs from state to state and is quite complex at this early stage, we have not observed any emerging trends that would change our membership or financial outlooks. We have built robust tracking and monitoring systems to maximize retention of members that meet the eligibility criteria and to also promptly understand any financial impacts of redeterminations. Some early observations include the following, starting with membership. Our outreach protocols have been successful in helping eligible members remain in the Medicaid program. Each state has implemented an ex parte membership renewal program from state to state. We see automatic re-enrollment rates through these ex parte programs ranging from 20% to 70% of members reviewed. Data suggests and states have verified that two-thirds of those disenrolled have been procedural rather than due to verification of ineligibility. Many of these members potentially remain fully Medicaid eligible and will have a high likelihood of reconnecting to the Medicaid program. Members have 90 days to 120 days to reconnect depending on state policies. Once reconnected, Medicaid coverage and premiums reinstate retroactively to the date of disenrollment. As we interact with members who lose eligibility, we seek to warm transfer them to our Marketplace team for potential enrollment in that product. This process is in its beginning stages. Turning to early observations on the financial impact of redeterminations. Terminated members have slightly lower medical costs than the portfolio average. However, these impacts are well within our expectations and our overall MCR outlook for the year. Of course, as trends emerge, we’ll be working with our state partners to ensure rates reflect any impacts of redetermination either prospectively in the normal fiscal year rate cycle, off cycle or retrospectively if necessary. We are still in the early stages of the Medicaid redetermination process. States representing half of our Medicaid revenue just began the process in June, and states representing a third of our revenue are now initiating disenrollments in July. Based on our experience to date, our current outlook on the impact of redeterminations on our business remains consistent with our previously stated expectations. Through the end of the first quarter, we estimated we had gained approximately 800,000 Medicaid members organically since the start of the pandemic. We continued to expect to retain roughly half of the members gained with no assumption for marketplace recapture. We expect the premium impact of members disenrolling to be approximately $1.6 billion and at portfolio average margins, the earnings impact could be approximately a $1 per share, split one-third in 2023 and two-thirds in 2024. Lastly, some additional color on our 2024 premium revenue outlook. As Joe mentioned, we have line of sight to the building blocks that are expected to deliver approximately $38 billion in projected revenue in 2024 or 19% growth off our 2023 premium guidance of $32 billion. These building blocks include $1.1 billion of organic growth in our current footprint, plus $4 billion from our recent state contract wins and approximately $2.3 billion of acquisition related premium, consisting of the full year of My Choice Wisconsin and the recently announced California Medicare acquisition. Partially offsetting these growth drivers is $1.4 billion for the impact of redeterminations and known pharmacy carve-outs. In summary, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance and the momentum we have established toward achieving our growth targets.  This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today’s first question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Josh Raskin: Hi. Thanks. Appreciate all the color on the redeterminations. That’s where I’ll start. So could you just sort of speak to the discussions that you’re having with the states? I know it’s early and, four of them, you know, literally started this month, but just the conversations around rates and the impact from reverifications. You mentioned this slight mix shift that you’re seeing, but could you just walk us through sort of the timing of potential rate adjustments and, how you think that plays out over time? And then is there a scenario where you can accrue higher rates based on discussions with the states, or are we going to need to see, you know, something in writing or something, formally passed at the state level before you can match, your rates to the change in acuity?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, Josh, I’ll start and then I’ll kick it to Mark for some color. First of all, the rate cycle in terms of the – our portfolio of states and how the rate cycles emerge actually couldn’t be better positioned for how the redetermination process is going to unfold. 25% of our revenue has rates that renew between April and July, another 25% in the early fall and 50% on January 1, which gives us good opportunity to have great visibility into any potential impact of redeterminations and engage in those discussions with the state, which are already occurring. Now as you know, and I’ll note the impact of acuity shifts is a normal rating criteria. Rating criteria includes a credible medical cost baseline, a trend off the baseline, benefit changes, plus or minus, and any potential acuity shift. So the fact that there’s an acuity shift that’s speculated to occur is actually part of the dialogue we’re already having in the states. Now only a handful of states actually implemented rates between April and July. And I’ll hand it over to Mark and he can give you some color on how those discussions went.
Mark Keim: Hey, good morning Josh, so in July, we had five states representing about 10% of our revenue move into a new pricing cycle. About half of those states led with a proactive concession for what’s going on with redetermination. The other half said, gee [ph], we have no data yet. But as data develops, we will either retro or mid-cycle make an adjustment. I think the overarching theme here, it is still so early, even here in late July to be looking at data-driven conclusions on redetermination. So all states have made the commitment that rates will be actuarially sound. And just about all states have said that mid-cycle, they’ll make a mid-cycle adjustment or a retro adjustment to do a catch up if needed. And of course, we’re in there talking with states that on normal rate cycles, we’re getting things proactively where we need it. The other part of your question, our accounting policies require that we have specific documentation on rates – so we’ll book them as they actually get confirmed by the states.
Josh Raskin: Okay. So bottom line half are reflecting this already in some sort of perspective, we see it coming and the other half are going to make you whole at some point?
Mark Keim: Of the states in July, that is correct. 
Josh Raskin: Yes. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Justin Lake at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. 
Justin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple of questions on numbers. First, on the exchanges, can you tell us what the potential benefit was or what the actual benefit was to second quarter in terms of the 2022 final risk adjustment true-up. And then you said there that you’re confident in mid-single-digit target margins your MLR looks to me like it’s down 10% plus in the first and second quarter. Last year was flat. So it looks like you’re on target to do well better than 5%. And am I missing something there? Or is the back half going to be kind of flat year-over-year on an MLR basis?
Joe Zubretsky: Justin, it’s Joe, I’ll kick it to Mark for some color. The marketplace business, our strategy of keep it small, silver and stable, plus starring in a 9% price increase for the year clearly has us on track for mid-single-digit margins. In fact, our guidance contemplates about just over 6% pretax margin for the full year. Now to your question, while you’re at 71.2% for the first half, that must mean you’re at 85% for the second half. Two factors. One, we’re taking on special enrollment period membership as the year goes on. So as the year progresses, more – higher mix of your membership is special enrollment membership, which carries a higher initial MLR and second, a greater proportion of our book is in higher deductible products, which makes the seasonality toward the back half more dramatic than it has been in the past. 71% first half, 85% second half, 78% for the year. Mark, do you want to talk about the drop?
Mark Keim: Sure. I saw some analysts right on this topic. And some of them, we’re throwing around some pretty big numbers as much as $66 million in positive development of December 31. Just on risk adjustment. And what those analysts miss is that about half of that benefit a little more is tied up in margins. For those of you that follow the accounting, when we hang up an actuarial liability for risk adjustment, we try to identify the liability, but we also book a margin associated with it in case we’re wrong.  More to the point, we also book a margin for risk adjustment data validation or RADV. So that $66 potential benefit that folks were looking at is roughly cut in half, a little bit more than cut in half just by the retention of margins that don’t fall to the bottom line. So then you’re working with a little bit less than half of that. The other thing is, as these risk adjustment liabilities ultimately emerge, most of you are aware that a service called Wakeley [ph], which anonymously combines the inputs from everybody so that we can all get some insights as we move along. As a result, quarter-to-quarter, we’re accruing and getting pretty dialed in on the ultimate liability. So this big number we’re potentially talking about more than cut and half, and largely recognized in first quarter with a little bit in the second quarter. The only other thing I’d say on the topic is this is normal development of risk adjustment kind of like IBNR, you always book it, but you expect it to roll off slightly favorable. So I wouldn’t call this necessarily an anomaly, but it is spread between the first and second quarter, and it’s in our numbers.
Joe Zubretsky: And Justin, the last thing I would say on the topic, the return to mid-single-digit margins is really a result of that disciplined strategy that has worked and was executed perfectly for the year, 6% pretax for the full year not because of accounting adjustments, but because of the pricing discipline and the positioning of the book. Thank you.
Justin Lake: That’s great detail. Thanks. I’ll – can I squeeze in one on investment income, Joe? What’s the expectation for the full year? And then you said some of this is temporary. What should we think about normal investment income as we take out to 2026?
Joe Zubretsky: Well, the way we look at it, first of all, your pick on the yield curve would determine for the most part, what that would look like. But what we try to remind folks is that of our $8 billion portfolio, half is in intermediate term securities where we won’t be immediately responsible to interest rate changes and the other half is in cash, which will be immediately responsible to interest rate changes. That’s the first fact. And make your yield curve pick for the rest of the year. We certainly are forecasting lower interest rates for the back half of the year on our cash balance, which also will be reduced between mid-year and end of the year due to the payment of some significant government payables that we need to get paid. Mark, any more color?
Mark Keim: Joe’s got it right. Half of the portfolio is in cash, we made close to 5% on that cash in the second quarter. Now if anybody’s guess what the Fed does here. But our balance sheet is obviously very responsive to changes in Fed short-term rates. So 5% of that cash in the second quarter, but it’s anybody’s guess where these rates go third and fourth quarter. And as Joe mentioned, I’m also forecasting a slight decline in cash balance as we pay out some payables and some other true-ups on our balance sheet. 
Justin Lake: Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Stephen Baxter of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. 
Stephen Baxter: Yes. Hey, I appreciate all the color on redeterminations and the procedural terminations that we’re seeing out there. I guess I wanted to ask on the ex parte reviews and the success getting some members reenrolled. I’d love to get a sense of what percentage of members getting terminated for procedural reasons are actually getting these ex parte reviews? Is it all members that are terminated for those reasons or some kind of subset, and then is your expectation that going forward, more of these reviews will be happening ahead of disenrollment – my understanding was that’s generally how it’s supposed to work. So I’m surprised there’s so much focus on it now occurring on the back end? Thank you.
Joe Zubretsky: Let me just reframe the numbers, and I’ll keep it to more. Our states have all have executed ex parte processes. The automatic renewal rates have ranged from 20% to 70%, which is actually quite high. On terminations, at least two-thirds of the terminations have been procedural, in some cases, up to 75%, which then means – and this is the important point on the procedural terminations. The number of reconnects of the members that will reconnect to the process within the 90- to 120-day grace period is actually expected to be quite high since the procedural termination rate was also quite high. Now we haven’t seen that yet. Because this process just started. But we believe throughout the third quarter into the fourth, we’re going to see significant reconnection activity, which will carry with it retroactive premium back to the initial data disenrollment. Mark, some color on the detail numbers?
Mark Keim: Absolutely. So, ex parte, 20% to 70% of folks reviewed, just to be clear, that’s in advance of any loss of membership. It’s obviously a way to avoid folks losing their eligibility. There’s a few resources out there that have published views on this 40% of members when they go through eligibility verification, are losing their eligibility. 60% are retaining eligibility. It’s estimated that 50% of the 60% that retain get it through ex parte. So it’s obviously very powerful, and CMS is encouraging states to step it up and do more ex parte.  Finally, as Joe mentioned, with two-thirds of the folks losing eligibility due to procedural reasons, this reconnects is really important. States are giving between 90 and 120 days for folks that lose eligibility to become aware of it, refile and get back on rolls. And if they do it within 90 to 120 days, their eligibility goes retro to the day they lost it. So we cover any claims in the interim, but also the premium for us goes retro back to the day they lost their eligibility. So very powerful on these reconnects. It’s too early here in July for us to really see good data on reconnects. Most of our markets started in June, which means reconnects will just start coming in the next month or two, but a really powerful part of these enrollments.
Stephen Baxter: Thanks. And just one quick follow-up, if I can. You mentioned the medical cost profile on the early disenrollment slightly favorable. I guess at this stage, how are you thinking about what that could look like for the reconnects. Thank you. 
Joe Zubretsky: Didn’t get the last part of your question. But yes, on the members that are disenrolling the medical loss ratio is slightly more favorable than the portfolio average as expected. All contemplated within the 88.5% medical care ratio that we projected for the Medicaid business for the full year. We have seen nothing that suggests that we will not be able to hit that. And bear in mind, as we mentioned many other times, we also have, in many of our states, either a corridor or a minimum MLR, that carries with it a rather significant liability that we’ve already recorded. Any medical cost inflection that happens in the back half of the year would be first absorbed by any corridor or minimum MLR liability before impacting our earnings. Mark?
Mark Keim: Yes. Just to add to that, levers are slightly lower on MLR. We’re expecting a lot of reconnects. How will reconnects come back on MLR? Well, there’s a theory out there that reconnects many of them will only become aware of their need to reconnect because they have another claim or another doc visit, which means when they’re coming back on, they may come with a claim but they were also likely to come with two to three months of premium revenue. So I’m expecting pretty much a reversion to our mean as we see these reconnects and not a lot of volatility there.
Stephen Baxter: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. 
A.J. Rice: Hi everybody. Maybe just quickly, a couple of other aspects on the reverification process. I wonder you can see the states are publishing about how many members are getting disenrolled and how much of process disenrollments, I know you’ve got a lot of outreach efforts. Is your own experience at this point different than the aggregate numbers we’re seeing states? Are you able to engage more effectively? And I’d also wonder I know these people engage with the health system, clinics, ERs and hospitals, pharmacies, et cetera. Do you have any data on how often a member engages with one of those locations that might end up being a catalyst to get renewed proactively?
Joe Zubretsky: Well, I think on the first part of your question, first of all, state mix is really important. As we said in our prepared remarks, some states moved very aggressively initially, some states more cautiously. Some states, even – three of our states pause to let the administrative processes catch up with the flow of work. So I think state mix is really, really important as you judge any one company or any one state against sort of the market average. But we have seen nothing in the process that is outside of our expectations as we said. In terms of experience, we believe that a member will be reminded that they need to be on Medicaid if and when they have to go to the doctor or the emergency room or for some procedure. And as Mark said, maybe they’ll come back with a claim, but they’ll also come back with three or four months of retro premium. And that means the reversion to the mean to the portfolio average MCR is supported by that thesis.
Mark Keim: A.J., the only other thing I’d add is so many of our members are associated with family members and the incidence of one family member over the first couple of months needing medical care of some kind is high, which means the whole family gets renewed. So that’s really a helpful fact as we think about these reconnects.
A.J. Rice: Okay. And maybe just one follow-up on the – in your comments about the Bright Health acquisition. You mentioned that one; you’ve got a solvency contingency in there. Is that related to the California plan you’re buying? Or is that related to all of Bright Health and would there be any opportunity if there is any issues for you to support the California plan as you’re waiting to get the regulatory approvals. 
Joe Zubretsky: No, that comment did not relate to the properties that we acquired – the properties we acquired will carry with it the amount of regulatory capital needed to run the plan. They are underperforming on margin, but really good line of sight to membership and revenue. That comment was really to state that the ongoing, going concern in the financial solvency of the parent company would obviously be critical to their ability to close the transaction. That’s all that referred to. The properties have intact revenue and will be delivered with the required amount of capital.
A.J. Rice: Okay, thanks a lot. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Calvin Sternick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. 
Calvin Sternick: Yes. Thanks for the question. I know it’s pretty early on the marketplace side of things, but just curious what kind of sort of trends you’re seeing in terms of applications or enrollment in June and July that you can speak to? And then maybe just one follow-up on the Bright business, $1 per share of embedded earnings, no contribution next year, but can you give a sense for what sort of the time line is to reaching run rate on that business?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure. I’ll comment on the Bright acquisition first, and then we’ll comment about the marketplace. This is the first Medicare acquisition we’ve done. And Medicare, as works on an annual cycle for star ratings, for risk adjustment for rates, et cetera. The business had its own profit improvement plan in place. So the answer to your question is unknown at the time. How much profit improvement will that business have during the period time to close, we don’t know. We are still confident that whatever is delivered to us at the time of closing, we will be able to get that to our target margins by the end of the second year. So when we said no earnings contribution early because we don’t know exactly what the financial status, the margin status of the plan that will be delivered to us will be at the time of closing. So breakeven initially a minimum, and then we’ll build a target margin in a two year period, and we’re very confident in the $1 estimate that we’ve given you.
Mark Keim: On the marketplace question, you’ll appreciate with special enrollment period, we’re constantly picking up members month-to-month. That’s a pretty routine phenomenon here. What will be different going forward is we’ll start to pick up people that came off the Medicaid roles. Now we’ve got good visibility in special enrollment period, month-to-month, who’s coming in from Medicaid. Who’s coming in from our Medicaid plans, who’s coming in from other Medicaid plans, those numbers are still quite de minimis. Within our special enrollment period gains. But I would expect them to pick up dramatically in the months ahead. Remember, June is still the first month that most folks came off. So July, August, September, I would expect to see the marketplace numbers start to creep up. And we’re able to track those who’s coming from Medicaid and what plans.
Joe Zubretsky: And just as a reminder, our membership forecast do not include the retention of Medicaid membership losses into our marketplace product. We didn’t have a good estimate of what that would look like. We still don’t – that would be upside to our membership projection.
Calvin Sternick: Great. Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead. 
Scott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Actually just wanted to stick on the marketplace topic. And just interested in some of your early thoughts around positioning for 2024, given that if you’re going to be back at target margins here this year, I know that you’re very sensitive to managing the exposure on this business given how volatile it’s been on the margin side, but it definitely looks like there’s a pretty hardening pricing environment for individual and small group occurring – for 2024. And then if there is continued opportunity on the Catcher’s Mitt side for [indiscernible] in 2024 as well. So really just sort of thinking about where your sort of philosophy is right now on that growth versus margin question for the exchanges in 2024. 
Joe Zubretsky: So Scott, our position on margin versus growth for Marketplace has not changed. We will position the business to earn mid-single-digit target margins and then allow it to grow at whatever rate can produce those margins, small, silver and stable. Now we’ve just put out a revenue estimate for next year an outlook of $38 billion or 19% growth year-over-year, which includes only a modest amount, a moderate amount of projected growth in Marketplace. So we do plan to allocate more capital to Marketplace next year, but the growth we anticipate by the prices we filed will be measured and moderate. We actually don’t need to allocate more capital to Marketplace in order to produce high-teens growth rates in the business, 19% premium growth year-over-year with only modest and moderate growth in Marketplace since Medicaid is doing so well.
Scott Fidel: Okay. Got it. And then just for the follow-up. Interested if you could maybe just walk us through what’s now factored into guidance for Medicare MLR for the back half of the year? And then just, I guess, obviously, you’re not giving 2024 guidance here, but some early thoughts on some suggestions on how we should think about Medicare MLR sort of modeling for 2024. Obviously, it’s a bit elevated this year and looking out to a pretty challenging rate environment next year and then you’ve got the Bright asset coming online as well at breakeven. So just sort of your thinking here on sort of Medicare MLR, I guess, sort of trajectory in the back half and it’s 2024. Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Sure. For 2024, first of all, we are – we believe we were conservative in our trend estimates that we included in our Medicare bids for 2024. Second point is, recall, only about half our business actually relies on the Medicare bidding process. The other half is the MMP business, where we get rates that are not tied to that process. When it comes to star ratings and risk adjustment and all those other features and factors, again, the fact that we’re in the half of the business is MNP is helpful to that process. And when it comes to stars, we have plenty of value-added benefits, the actuarial value of value-added benefits is significant as it is with competitors. So we believe that we can maintain margins by pulling back some of the ancillary benefits still have a very competitively priced product and a very competitively positioned product from a benefit perspective to continue to grow the business.
Mark Keim: And just to build on that, I feel good that we had a reasonable line of sight into Q2 as we put in our pricing for next year. Scott, just on your question on the rest of 2023, we’re conservative guys within our guidance is mid-to-low 88 [ph] for the rest of the year, and that’s within the guidance we’ve given.
Scott Fidel: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Sarah James: Thank you. Some of the states have filed waivers that allow you to be a little bit more hands on in communicating updated contact information. I’m wondering if you’re noticing any difference in those states with the procedural and unable to contact terminations. And then in the states that didn’t file the waivers like Florida, when [indiscernible] opened the door for more collaboration between health plans and states on that. Did that make a difference in your discussions with Florida around how to reach out correctly to eligible?
Joe Zubretsky: Well, Sarah, I don’t think we’re going to comment on any particular state, but we – our protocols that we started building a year ago on member outreach and every state was different. Some states allowed significant involvement from MCOs, some states less so. Some states allow you to actually help the member reestablish eligibility by filling out forms. Some states didn’t. Now as you know, CMS has stepped in and sort of suggested through policy statements that states should allow MCOs to be more involved in the reverification process. So I assure you that we are locked in to every single state in which we do business with the state regulatory authorities and are working hand in glove with them to make sure that everybody that should be on Medicaid is and people that shouldn’t be thrown off Medicaid aren’t. State by state. And yes, it has had an impact on our outreach efforts and gives us really good line of sight and good visibility into the fact that if a member should be on Medicaid, we’re pretty confident between the state’s efforts and our efforts that we’ll be able to keep them in the system.
Sarah James: Great. And then just to follow up on Scott’s question around the Medicare bids. If I think about in context of the book that you’re acquiring from Bright, and your guidance of breakeven in year one, are you assuming that if there is any industry-wide utilization inflation on Medicare that, that was captured in their 2024 bid?
Joe Zubretsky: Without getting into specifics, I will answer the question this way. Our due diligence process through a clean room process allowed us visibility into their bid through an independent third party. And we are confident that the transparency that was provided in that process gives us confidence that the bid was rational, included all trend factors that should be included in a bid. And as I said, their profit improvement plan is going to be the key factor. How much of that profit improvement did they actually achieve between sign and close in terms of what we inherit is actually going to determine whether – what the bet earnings picture looks like at the point of closing.
Sarah James: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Michael Ha with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Michael Ha: Thank you. Just quickly, first on redetermination, Mark, I know you mentioned the state made proactive concessions and rates for redeterminations in July. Just wanted to clarify, were those rate adjustments ready embedded in your current 2023 guidance? Or does that represent upside to your guide and are you able to provide a sense on magnitude of those rate concessions?
Mark Keim: Well, a couple of things. Those couple of states that we already had rate concessions in the July 1 race. A very small part of our revenue and also done somewhat academically as the data hadn’t developed in those states quite yet. All of that is incorporated in the guidance I’ve given you. But again, such a small component. I think I mentioned five states started their new fiscal year, July 1, representing just 10% of revenue, and the states that gave those concessions were a subset within that. So not really a big deal, but in guidance.
Michael Ha: Got it. Thank you. And just to dive deeper into MA MLR, curious, what specific type of outpatient utilization driving the pressure this quarter? Was it pent-up demand, hips, knees, could you walk us through the progression of the utilization year-to-date? Like how much of it might have been 1Q versus 2Q? And on the – I think there’s about $27 million of unfavorable PPD in the quarter. Curious if you could help us break it out between MA commercial Medicaid. Thank you.
Joe Zubretsky: I’ll keep the PPD question to Mark, but on the Medicare MLR, it was outpatient, mostly ambulatory surgeries. Our population really doesn’t have a lot of the hips, knees and joints that you’d see in a more standard Medicare advance population. But we’re also seeing PCP visits and the typical routine preventive screenings come back. I won’t call it pent-up demand, but returning to normal, the types of services that Medicare patients and members normally get. Ambulatory surgeries, PCP visits, preventive screenings and care, a little bit of drug usage, but not a lot. And keep in mind, we’re only operating – I need to – I’m not rationalized again, 120 basis points above the top end of our range. The Medicare book is well positioned to earn a 4.5% pretax margin this year. So we’re in good shape there. Mark, do you want to talk about the PPD?
Mark Keim: Yep. Michael, what’s your question about the prior year development?
Michael Ha: Yes.
Mark Keim: Yes. So…
Michael Ha: About $27 million.
Mark Keim: You got it exactly right. So in general, overall development was favorable. We take great confidence in quarter-after-quarter, our development is favorable. The prior year portion, as you point out, negative by a small amount. Typically, we would expect that to develop positively. But whenever there’s a particular provider contracts settlement or something going on, it can create some noise. But in particular, what happened to this quarter was there’s something some of you may be familiar with California SB 510, which was a specific court ruling that held health plans liable for certain COVID expenses. We’ve recognized that charge as did some of our other competitors this quarter, and that created a little bit of the noise you’re seeing.
Michael Ha: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Steven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning. So I guess, given your comments earlier on the call to address all the investor debate as to whether or not the Medicaid MLR could be adversely impacted by just lower utilization members coming off the rolls during redeterminations and thus risk of higher Medicaid MLR on the remaining Medicaid members. Really just the conclusion around all that is what is your level of concern around this higher Medicaid MLR risk at this point, if any? Can be now put this to bed from your perspective. And also, if you could remind us, is there any preliminary buy as you can point to for your 2024 Medicaid MLR to be either better, in line or worse versus what you guided for Medicaid MLR for 2023? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Well, Steven, since we haven’t changed our outlook for the redetermination process, 800,000 members up, 400,000 down, $1.6 billion in premium, one third this year, two thirds next and an 88.5% Medicaid MCR for the year. Since we haven’t changed all our acuity determination and we’re holding firm on our Medicaid outlook – Medicaid MLR outlook for the year – that’s all been contemplated. So we’re in good shape there. We see nothing that causes us to change that point of view. The fact that the MCRs of levers is slightly more favorable than the portfolio average is not a surprise, and it’s maybe not as dramatic as one might think. The other point to make and bear in mind, and we don’t disclose year-by-year how much of this we have. But most of our states have some form of either minimum MLR or some type of corridor program that we are well into because we operate very efficiently, we historically have paid into these mechanisms. Any intra-year impact from on medical margin, whether it’s trend or whether it’s yield, would be first absorbed by the significant liabilities we have already recorded for these conventions. That gives us great confidence that the 88.5% is a very good estimate for the year, all contemplated within the $20.75 guide for the year. Mark, do you want to talk about maybe some of the bridging items in the next year?
Mark Keim: Yes, into next year, specifically around Medicaid MLRs – it will be partly a function of these pricings and rate cycles that we’re having, most of which are in front of us. 50% of our revenue comes up for our January 1 fiscal year. That – those pricing discussions, obviously, actuarial policies require that states recognize anything that goes on with redetermination. And then finally, as Joe mentioned, even into next year, those continuing corridors and minimum MLRs continue to give us great comfort on our projected margins. So not looking at a lot of volatility into next year.
Steven Valiquette: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Kevin Fischbeck at Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Kevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. I want to go back to a question a couple of times, I’m not sure if you answered it. Is there a way to quantify how much the states who have built in something for rates are putting in? Is it something like 20 basis points? Is it 200 basis points? Like how should we think about how the states are thinking about the types of rates that need to be adjusted to reflect redeterminations.
Mark Keim: Yes. Thanks for the question, Kevin. I’m hesitant to give specific numbers because it differs state to state. But the real reason I’m hesitant to give the numbers is two things. One, for the most part, they were done academically, not on data they were done prospectively academically, so means they were guessing no better than all the rest of us were three months ago. So academic prospective. But the bigger point is you might get a specific concession for redetermination. But in the presence of seven or eight adjustments up and down for other reasons, it gets lost co-mingled into the grand scheme of things. We have to come back to the overall concept of actuarial soundness. And if those rates develop in a place that just aren’t appropriate, we’ll be back with our states to make sure that they are.
Kevin Fischbeck: Okay. That makes sense. And then I guess maybe just on trend, generally speaking, – it seems like a lot of companies are talking about MA trend being higher, but not seeing it in commercial or Medicaid. Is there a reason why you look at this and say, that makes sense why it’s not broader, like MA has been below trend, but I guess Medicaid has kind of been below trend, too. So why do you think that we’re seeing an above-average return on Medicare Advantage, but not within Medicaid?
Joe Zubretsky: It’s really hard to say. First of all, our Medicare book, the profile of it is vastly different than many of the other books of business. This is not mainstream MAPD. This is high acuity, D-SNP and the demonstrations, which are the fully integrated Medicare and Medicaid product. So the population is vastly different. Look, our trends in the quarter were very simple to understand, 3% in Medicaid, 6% in Medicare, 7.5% in Marketplace. All well within expectations. And I would just say that the mix of the book of business and the profile of the book of business better said, is probably reasons for some of the differential as competitors report their results.
Kevin Fischbeck: I guess when you think about it within your own book of business, if Medicaid is come in well during COVID and Medicare came in well during COVID and now Medicare snapping back of Medicaid is not is there a reason why by case, not snapping back?
Joe Zubretsky: I don’t think there’s any discernible answer to that. The 81% of our book of business is Medicaid. The trend is behaving exactly within our expectations. And why one is behaving slightly hotter or more warm than the other, it’s hard to tell.
Kevin Fischbeck: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Nathan Rich at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Nathan Rich: Great. Good morning, and thank you for the question. Just as it relates to the exchange opportunity from members that go through the redetermination process. It sounds like you haven’t seen much, if anything, on that front yet. But I guess in the outreach you’re doing with members, – have you had any kind of early success with potentially directing those members to a Marketplace plan who might not be eligible for Medicaid.
Joe Zubretsky: Well, the process – again, it’s early. The process is in full gear. We have robust distribution channels internally, call center employees or licensed agents who know how to do this, and the warm transfer process is enacted and in process. All we’re saying is because it’s so early, we have not seen a huge uptick in the number of marketplace members we’re getting out of Medicaid. We track what we obtain in marketplace out of our own Medicaid plans, but we also track what we get in the marketplace from other Medicaid plans. And because it’s drilling the process, all we’re saying is that monthly figure has not increased dramatically, but we expect it will as this process gets more traction.
Mark Keim: I think that’s right to build on that. Remember, two-thirds of these folks that are coming off are procedural, which means they don’t even know that they’re losing coverage. When they do, they’ll either come back on to Medicaid or what a great chance to get them on the Marketplace.
Nathan Rich: Great. And then some state Medicaid programs, I think, are looking at covering the GLP-1 drugs for obesity. I guess, have you had any conversations with states with respect to that? And what factors they might be considering and how that could be worked into state programs just as we think about what potential impact could be?
Joe Zubretsky: Yes. Right now, I think the way to look at it is Medicare doesn’t pay for off-label uses. And when it comes to the individual states, some do allow it for weight control and many don’t. But as they contemplate it, it’s a rate discussion. My view is there’s no medical cost that is inappropriate. If there’s a medical cost or a benefit that’s included in the program as long as it’s rated for that’s fine. So the trend in these prescriptions is well known and well documented. Some states already included in their formularies, others don’t. And when that conversation comes up, then it’s a conversation between actuaries in terms of the pharmacy component of the rate and whether it covers the $12,000 a year that it’s going to cost to dispense one of these prescriptions.
Nathan Rich: Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, our final question today comes from George Hill at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
George Hill: Hey good morning guys and thanks for sneaking me in. I know it’s a small part of the business. But I guess is there a way to big picture think about like the magnitude of the change in the value of the benefit in MA for 2024 as you guys try to balance the kind of the challenging rate environment with the changes to the risk model with kind of the need to preserve the margin profile of the business or preserve the margin profile of the business. Everybody kind of talks about the kind of the like the drawing down on benefit bout just trying to get a sense of magnitude, if there’s a way to quantify that or kind of talk about it directionally.
Joe Zubretsky: George, we couldn’t hear the first part of your question. Are you talking about Medicare Advantage?
George Hill: Yes, I was. And just like with the challenging rate environment, everybody is talking about kind of like the raining and it benefits a little bit. I don’t know if there’s a way to quantify that a little bit or kind of speak to it directionally kind of the magnitude of the change of benefit.
Joe Zubretsky: Yes. No, I understand. We’re not going to begin to publish sort of the percentage of actuarial value of the product that’s represented by ancillary benefits. But it’s significant. Our products are very competitive. With all the types of benefits, vision, dental, those cash card benefits, travel benefits, gym memberships, all those things are included in the product. And our competitive intelligence and analysis suggests that we can have a zero premium product with competitive benefits if and when our star ratings aren’t necessarily benchmarked with the rest of the market. We’re not going to size that, but we’re pretty confident that we can pull in benefits marginally, still have a very, very robust product in respect to ancillary benefits and still be competitive.
Mark Keim: The only other thing I’d add, George, is when we think about benefit design, there are a number of items which for a competitive shopper are must-have. And there’s a bunch of other things, which are part of the benefit load that are nice to have but don’t necessarily influence the buying decision. You can imagine how we’re thinking about changing benefit design. But we and our decisions probably won’t be much different than the broader markets. So I’m expecting a pretty even competitive dynamic next year.
George Hill: That’s great color. Thanks guys.
Joe Zubretsky: And with no other calls, that concludes our call today. Thank you, everyone.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-27 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Molina Healthcare First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation there will an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Krocheski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Joe Krocheski: Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare's first quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our first quarter earnings was distributed after the market close yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that remarks made are as of today, Thursday, April 27, 2023. It has not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. On this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our first quarter 2023 press release. During our call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our 2023 guidance, Medicaid redeterminations, our recent RFP awards and related revenue growth, our acquisitions and M&A activity, our long-term growth strategy and our embedded earnings power and margins. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report filed with the SEC, as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. Lastly, we want to invite you to attend our 2023 Investor Day meeting scheduled for Monday, May 15, where we will share more about our future growth plans and longer term strategy. Details for the event can be found in our Investor Relations website. I will now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?
Joe Zubretsky: Thank you, Joe, and good morning. Today, we will provide updates on our financial results for the first quarter 2023, our full year 2023 guidance in the context of our first quarter results and our growth initiatives and our strategy for sustaining profitable growth. Let me start with the first quarter highlights. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of $5.81 or 19% year-over-year growth. Total premium revenues at $7.9 billion were as expected, representing a 5% increase over the prior year. Our 87.1% consolidated MCR in the first quarter demonstrates continued strong operating performance. We produced a 5.5% adjusted pretax margin, 4.1% after-tax, a very strong result that is above the high-end of our long-term target range. In the first quarter, we continued to generate excellent margins in our Medicaid business with a medical care ratio of 88.4%. This result was in line with our guidance and long-term target range. Our portfolio of 19 state contracts in 2023 growing to 21 states in 2024, provides earnings [balanced] (ph) and diversification related to rate setting and contract reprocurements. Actuarially sound rates prevail, as the rate-setting process continues to capture a credible medical cost baseline with forward trend and benefit changes and core medical cost trends remained stable and well-controlled. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 88%, which is at the high-end of our long-term target range as a result of driving growth into high acuity low-income consumer segment. In Marketplace, we ended the quarter with 271,000 members. Our Marketplace business is appropriately sized in the overall portfolio, given the inherent volatility of that risk pool. Our first quarter Marketplace MCR was 68.6%, significantly below full year expectations even when considering seasonal patterns. This result reflects the successful implementation of our pricing, metallic mix and membership continuity strategy to restore this business to mid-single digit target margins. In summary, 2023 is off to a very strong start. Medicaid, our flagship business representing over 80% of revenue continues to produce strong predictable operating results and cash flows. Our high acuity Medicare niche serving low income members continues to grow organically and Marketplace is now well positioned to achieve target margins in 2023. Turning now to our 2023 guidance. Based on our strong start to the year, we are increasing our full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance to no less than $20.25 or 30% growth year-over-year, even after absorbing $0.75 of one-time implementation costs for new contract wins. We have deliberately reframed from increasing our guidance beyond the first quarter outperformance as we continue to apply appropriate conservatism to our forecast. We believe this conservative discipline is appropriate for several reasons. First, we would not project our significant first quarter Marketplace outperformance to be repeated for the balance of the year. Second, we are not forecasting short-term interest rates to remain at their current levels. Third, as a general matter at this early-stage in the year, it is prudent to anticipate potential medical cost variations. And fourth, and lastly, we do not believe the acuity shift due to redeterminations will have a significant net margin impact, but there is the potential for some sporadic and isolated shifts in acuity. If that were to be the case, there are significant mitigants to any potential impact. These mitigants include a commensurate mix effect premium benefit, experienced rebate and minimum MLR offsets in certain states, and of course, actuarially sound rate adjustments, both retrospective and prospective. That being said, we believe that any potential shift in Medicaid member acuity that could increase medical costs for 2023 is captured in our 88.5% Medicaid MCR guidance for the year. Turning now to an update on our strategy for sustaining profitable growth. Building on our momentum from last year, we are off to a strong start in 2023. At the end of January, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission posted its intent to award our Texas Health Plan, a contract for all our existing eight service areas in the state. Given the continuity of coverage in these service areas and strong brand loyalty, we expect to see continued market share gains and revenue upside in Texas. In March, we announced that our Indiana Health plan was awarded a four year contract to provide managed long-term services and supports. We believe this contract will commence in mid-2024. As one of four managed care organizations in the program, we expect to serve approximately 33,000 members, resulting in annual premium revenue of approximately $1 billion. With the addition of the Indiana LTSS win, our five recent state RFP wins driving within $5 billion in incremental revenue, with a portion included in our 2023 guidance, but most emerging in our 2024 outlook and achieving full run rate in 2025. Based on known building blocks, we now have line of sight to $36 billion of premium revenue in 2024 or 13% growth before additional strategic initiatives. Our new store embedded earnings are now $4.50 per share, providing meaningful visibility into our future earnings growth potential. We see an additional $2 per share of embedded earnings upside if and when the several remaining COVID era corridors are eliminated. Our acquisition pipeline remains replete with actionable opportunities. While the timing of transactions remains inherently difficult to predict, the strength of our pipeline and our track record of success give us confidence in our ability to drive further growth from this important element of our growth strategy. The company's performance continues to validate our long-term strategy, and its value creation potential. Our strategy is sound and it's working. We are delivering topline growth, both organically and with accretive acquisitions, while sustaining industry leading margins. Our model is clear and proven. We will grow organically in our existing footprint. We will win new state contracts and sign new acquisitions, building clear visibility to new store revenues and their related embedded earnings. We will harvest the embedded earnings and include them in our guidance as the contracts incept and the acquisitions closed, all while adding yet additional new revenue streams to our forward outlook. I look-forward to sharing more about our future growth plans and longer-term strategy at our Investor Meeting on May 15th. As is our hallmark style, we will provide you with our detailed playbook for achieving our growth targets and maintaining industry-leading margins. We will not only [declare those] (ph) but also show you with transparency and specificity, how we will achieve them. Our May 15th Investor Day session is appropriately titled, sustaining profitable growth, the next wave. With that I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark?
Mark Keim: Thanks, Joe, and good morning everyone. This morning I will discuss some additional details of our first quarter performance. I'll then turn to the balance sheet and some thoughts on our 2023 guidance. Beginning with some detailed commentary on our first-quarter results, our consolidated MCR for the first-quarter was 87.1%, reflecting continued strong medical cost management in each of our segments. In Medicaid, our reported MCR was 88.4%, a strong result that was in-line with our expectations and long-term target. During the quarter, flu, RSV and COVID related medical costs were minimal. The major medical cost categories were largely in-line with our expectation and normal quarter-to-quarter trend fluctuations. In the quarter, our Medicaid results were burdened with the prior-period premium adjustments. Absent those adjustments, our MCR was at the low-end of our long-term target range. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 88%, also within our long-term target range. During the quarter, we saw sharply lower flu and a continuing decline of COVID related costs, somewhat offset by the impact from continued growth in our D-SNP and MAPD products. In Marketplace, our reported MCR was 68.6%. This strong result reflects our pricing strategy to return this business to target margins, as well as seasonal patterns, which favored the first-half of the year. Recall, our pricing strategy increased our premium yield by approximately 9% this year and with approximately three quarters of our book in renewing members and two-thirds [indiscernible] metallic products, our risk scores should be optimally valued. We feel well-positioned to achieve our Mid-single digit target margins in this business for the year. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 7.2% which includes new business implementation spending ahead of the new contract wins, incepting in July and next year. Turning now to our balance sheet. Our capital foundation remains strong. We harvested $100 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter and our quarter-end parent company cash balance was $283 million. Debt at the end of the quarter was unchanged and just 1.7 times trailing 12 months EBITDA with debt to cap ratio at 42.3%. Net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.5 times and 39.3%, respectively, reflecting our low leverage position and ample cash and capital capacity for additional growth and investments. Turning to reserves, our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, and we continue to be confident in the strength of our reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was one day higher sequentially at 48 days of medical cost expense. Prior year development was favorable in the quarter demonstrating the integrity of our actuarial and reserving practices. I would note that the reported favorable prior year development, includes the release of margins on the prior year reserves, which is reestablished in the current quarter. And remaining P&L impact was largely absorbed by prior year minimum MLRs and experienced rebates. Finally, a few comments on guidance. We increased our 2023 adjusted earnings guidance by $0.50 to at least $20.25 per share. This increase is driven by first-quarter performance above our expectations. Partially offset by additional new store implementation costs for our recently-announced Indiana LTSS win and some general early in the year conservativism. We projected a little more than half of this year's earnings in the first two quarters. As Joe mentioned, our new-store embedded earnings in 2023 is now expected to be $4.50 per share comprised of two components: $4 per share, up from previously reported $3.50 for our recent new contract wins in California, Iowa, Nebraska and now including our new Indiana LTSS contract, plus $0.50 per share for the AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin acquisitions achieving their full run-rate accretion. We continue to carry approximately $2 per share for COVID era risk corridors, providing additional potential upside to the $4.50 of new-store embedded earnings. Within our guidance, our outlook on the resumption of redeterminations and the impact on our business is unchanged. Through March closing, we estimate we gained approximately 800,000 members organically since the start of the pandemic. We continue to expect to retain roughly half of the members gained. We expect the premium impact to be approximately $1.6 billion and that portfolio average margins the earnings impact to be approximately $1 per share. Due to the timing of when members dis-enrolled, we are projecting one-third of the premium and earnings impact to emerge in 2023 with the remainder mostly in 2024. Given that redetermination and disenrollment have just begun on April 1st in only one of our markets, we are unable to share additional data driven insights. However, we remain comfortable with our outlook on margins as we expect numerous items to minimize any potential trend impact from redetermination. First, as discussed in past quarters, our internal membership cohort analysis indicates limited acuity shift potential from several perspectives. Second, the mix effect of impacted membership cohorts dampens the impact. To be clear, redetermination likely effects lower PMPM members. So any cost pressure would be muted by the weighted average of continuing higher premium PMPM members. Third, the gradual rate of dis enrollment over the course of 2023 into 2024 dilutes any ultimate impact ahead of normal rate cycle adjustments. Fourth, the remaining COVID era risk corridors and pre-existing experienced rebate mechanisms as minimum MLR's in many states provides a cushion to absorb potential adverse trend development should it emerge. And finally, rate adjustments, both on-cycle and off-cycle prospective or retrospective will countering emerging trends as states honor their commitments for actuarially sound rates. In summary, we are very pleased with our first-quarter performance in each of our segments and our increased full-year earnings guidance. We look forward to sharing more about our growth strategy and compelling value creation story at our May 15th Investor Day. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Josh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Appreciate the comments you just made, Mark, on the re-verification impact and that you'll keep 400,000 of the 800,000 lives that you gained since the start of the pandemic. But of the 400,000 that get redetermined, can you just update us on your views on how many you think end-up in -- of those Medicaid lives end-up choosing exchanges? And then how granular can you be in terms of assisting your specific re-verified members to find in exchanges. For example, can you target specific populations or even specific individuals in terms of trying to get them to choose exchange products? Thanks.
Mark Keim: Great, thanks for the questions, Josh. I'll take the second one first. The states have a lot of different protocols and policies about how we can interact with members ahead of redetermination. The good news is, they're giving us the list of at risk members months ahead of time, which is very helpful to reach-out to them, interact with them, see if we can re-verify them or in many cases, put them into our Marketplace product if appropriate. Now in the cases where members are being redetermined, they lose their eligibility, which we're estimating is about 50%. I don't know that I had great insights on specifically where they'll go. And Josh, it's complicated, because what we see is some will get re-verified, lose eligibility and move right into another product, others may go uninsured for a few months and then eventually wind-up in one of those products. So I don't have good estimates on that. The only other thing I'll remind you of is, we didn't put any upside on retaining redetermined members in our Marketplace outlook. So anything that we pick up through redetermination is upside to our Marketplace outlook.
Josh Raskin: Perfect, thanks.
Mark Keim: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Stephen Baxter at Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Stephen Baxter: Yes. Hi, thanks for the question. I appreciate that you're thinking on redeterminations hasn't really changed. Over the past few months, though, we have seen a lot of states come out with their own projections on membership losses. It does seem like these estimates would generally skew towards lower levels of retention and 50%. You're assuming -- I assume you spend time talking to the states about their expectations. I'm curious what you think is the key difference between what they're assuming and what you think will play out? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Stephen, our analysis is bottoms up state-by-state. And of course, we are in active discussions with our state-based customers and helping them manage the 90 million people nationwide and we're going to go through the redetermination process. As Mark had mentioned, many of the states have various protocols and different protocols on how interactive we can be. But we are in very active discussions with our state-based customers. They have given us a list of what they consider at risk members, meaning, members that will likely have to go through a reverification process. And from everything we've learned since this all started months ago and now has only started in one state actually in the month of April, we stand pretty firm that our 800,000 member increase during the pandemic will decrease by 50% and end up at 400,000.
Mark Keim: And just to put a point on what Joe said, Stephen, maybe what you're reacting to is some of the at-risk member data points. The states are putting those out specifically so that managed care organizations can reach out to those members and whether its eligibility issues or verification issues, interact with those members to minimize it. So the list of at-risk is certainly bigger than the list of folks that will actually lose eligibility.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, our next question today comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Justin Lake: Thanks, good morning. A couple of things. One, Medicare Advantage, you talked about mix pushing you to the higher end of the MLR range there. What is the long-term MLR range you expect for Medicare Advantage? And can you give us a little color on the mix of business and why it's pushing it towards the higher end? And then lastly, just a number question on investment income, what is assumed in your guidance for investment income this year? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Justin, on the MLRs for Medicare, we continue to hold firm on our long-term forecast of between 87% and 88%. And I would just summarize it by saying, the faster we grow, it would push you towards the higher end of that range because the members we yet -- are not yet risk-scored, they're not yet into care management programs. And it takes a while for that a year or two for that MLR to settle back into our target range. So if we're growing nicely, which we are today at greater than 10% a year, it will push the MLR up into the higher end of that range, and we're very comfortable with that. On investment income, sure, short-term interest rates are very high currently. As our guidance suggested, we do not forecast them to remain at this level. I will remind you that half of our investable base is locked in at two to three year duration in short-term bonds. But the other half is entirely floating, it's cash and it's floating at short-term rates. And Mark and his team were, I think, appropriately cautious in projecting those rates to decline for the balance of the year.
Mark Keim: Yes, that's exactly right, Joe. The things to think about there is the investable balance will decline over the year from where it is and about $8.2 billion right now. It will decline as we pay down previous year corridors, minimum MLRs, things like that. Second, we're mostly in cash, which means we're instantly responsive to any cuts in rates. And when I look at the Fed funds outlook, most folks are baking in maybe another raise in the second quarter, but likely two cuts in the back half of the year. So we are cautious in our outlook.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, our next question today from comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Nathan Rich: Great, thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on the Marketplace business. How much of the outperformance, do you see as sustainable? It sounded like it was mainly driven by pricing and I guess, helped by strong retention. I guess, do you have an updated view of where MCR will land for the year? And then enrollment was a little bit lower than we had expected. I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on if 230,000 members by year-end is still the right target.
Joe Zubretsky: Nathan, it's Joe. Our strategy is working. The strategy to reallocate capital to businesses that add less inherent volatility like Medicare and Medicaid and to keep this at about 5% of the portfolio keeping it small, 5% of the portfolio, keeping its silver with two-thirds of our members in silver products and keeping it stable, 75% of the members renewing. Not only as is projected toward our target mid-single digit pretax target margins, but probably with less inherent volatility. So we're really pleased with that. The first quarter MCR had some seasonality aspects to it, and we did outperform. I would say that our guidance includes something closer to the bottom end of our long term range of 78% to 80%, perhaps a little lower than that. But particularly that more of the business was bronze than we had projected and bronze has higher deductibles. The seasonality tilt is a little steeper than we originally projected. We're on target for the bottom end of our 78% to 80% long-term target range for the full year.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Scott Fidel at Stephens. Please go ahead.
Scott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I was hoping to get some of your analysis on the final 2024 MA rates and then on the risk model as well in terms of what your estimated -- your MA rate impact will be? And then maybe give us some insights just into how you're thinking about the impact of the risk model to your particular membership base, which is heavily weighted, obviously, towards D-SNPs? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Scott, it's Joe. Yes, there are a variety of factors, regulatory factors that have been introduced in the past number of months that have caused folks in the Medicare Advantage business to think differently about the earnings trajectory. First, let me remind everyone that Medicare is only 15% of our total book. Also remind you that of that Medicare book, half of it are the MMP demonstrations. Now while MMP demonstrations aren't totally insulated from these industry dynamics, they do not have STARS scores. They're not subject to the rate notice, although rates come in a different way, 40% of that revenue is actually Medicaid driven and not Medicare-driven. So I wouldn't say we're insulated from it, but with half the book being in MMP, which is not responsive to those various rate type actions. We're pretty well insulated. But it does relate to our D-SNP book. We believe that our product is competitive. It is replete with value-added benefits. Many of these factors affected the entire market. So, if we have to pull back on value-added benefits to keep the product at zero premium and competitive, we think we can do so. I think we're well positioned for a couple of other good years in Medicare.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Michael Hall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Michael Hall: Thank you. Just quickly first on Medicaid revenue PMPM looks like it was roughly flat year-to-year, which may have driven your Medicaid revenue to be slightly below the street this quarter. I am having a tough time just thinking of what could have driven this, especially given higher LTSS mix, which presumably would have increased the blended PMPM. So any color you could provide there? And then on your comments about redeterminations, not expecting the acuity shift to have net margin impact, but could see some strategic cases. And I know you mentioned, Joe, that the shift in acuity captured in your current 88.5% guide. But comments today do sound a bit more optimistic. Is it fair to say what you've learned since fourth quarter about the acuity of your at-risk redetermined lives might be more incrementally positive?
Joe Zubretsky: I'm going to take the second part of the question first and kick it to Mark for the analysis of Medicaid revenue. No, we know very little more than we knew at the fourth quarter. Only one state has actually started the redetermination process, and it's a very small state for us. Now we believe that our cohort analysis, which analyzes various aspects of durational acuity, how many members do you have greater than a year or less than a year. How many members do you have that have zero 25% MCR. What's your lapse rate. Didn't go to zero, it decreased, but members were terminating during the pandemic. What's your coordination of benefits rates. It's up slightly, but not a lot. So the data does not suggest that there's a huge shift of members, durational acuity members, and we start there. Second, all we did was mention the mitigants that if something should occur somewhere in one of our markets. There's premium adjustments, premium mix will help us if we're deep into a rebate mechanism or a minimum MLR in that market, that will be the first cushion for a potential effect. And then, of course, you're into the rate cycle. And we believe -- not we believe, we know that the state and CMS have been in active discussions about what could potentially happen and they are not only amenable, but they're very supportive of potential retrospective or prospective rate actions. So that's our point of view. It really hasn't changed from the fourth quarter because we know very little more today than we do at that point.
Mark Keim: And Michael, it's Mark. Let me just take the first question on Medicaid, not sure what your model was, but the Medicaid revenue for me came in right about on expectation. But there's things that can move it a little up, a little down quarter-to-quarter, which might be driving some of what you're seeing. Certainly, mix changes quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year. Retro premiums, which are driven by a number of different items, retro membership updates, things like that certainly drive variations in revenues. And don't forget when we book corridors, minimum MLRs or any form of experience rebates, those run through the revenue line as well. So you put those things together, my hunch is, that's what explains what you're seeing. But overall, I think we're pretty close to just out everybody's model on first quarter.
Operator: And our next question today comes from George Hill at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
George Hill: Yes. Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. Joe, one of your competitors talked about kind of getting enhanced from the states as they start to go through the redetermination process. Would just be interested to hear kind of like what kind of data that you guys are having access to as this process begins to kick off and kind of how that impacts your early thoughts about 2024?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure. I'll send to Mark. But for the most part, what we're getting from states is what we're calling members at risk, members that will have to go through some form of process, either specifically or on an [indiscernible] basis to be redetermined. Mark, you're closer to the situation.
Mark Keim: Absolutely. So we started one state in April, but the vast majority of my states won't actually go through eligibility and redetermination until June and July. So, we're fairly back-end loaded here, which is why we're a little limited on data just at the moment. We've got one state. But as Joe mentioned, the way this works is long before a member would actually get redetermined or lose eligibility, they go on in at-risk list. And the states define at-risk in two ways. One, places where they have some data that suggests the member will lose eligibility, some data point that suggests that or just verification failures where they can't reach that number. They're giving us those lists months in advance. So I’m mostly back ended for June and July. But in many cases, I have a list of those members already. We can start reaching out to them, contacting them through all of our different channels long in advance. Now that data is not particularly helpful on what will happen because the whole point of that data is to preempt some of the people that shouldn't lose coverage. So, it's very helpful on us retaining members, but it's not helpful in saying from a data perspective, how many will we lose or what would the economic impact be, if any? Now the real data points on real stairs and levers don't happen until redetermination actually occurs. And again, for us, that's just one state so far. The states published files 834s, 820s, which let us know specifically who's coming and going, who the stairs and levers are. And we're way too early to have real insights on that given one state so far.
George Hill: Okay. So maybe just a quick follow-up to simplify this is, what you guys largely have now is kind of the medical data and the claims data on all these members. You guys don't have the economic and eligibility data, and it's kind of the eligibility. Like, I'm trying to figure out what is the data like, what changes from a data access perspective that kind of better informs what you guys see? And it sounds like it's really kind of like the eligibility data and the at-risk list.
Joe Zubretsky: Yes. Just because the member has been identified as someone who will have to go through the reeligibility process. And by the way, that data is very immature. It's not in hundreds of thousands of members. It's tens of thousands of members. We can extrapolate very little from that. And so, it's way too early to make -- draw any conclusions from the early at-risk member data that we've seen. It will build over time. And as we have insights and we report quarters, we'll fill you in on where we are.
George Hill: Appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Albert Rice: Hi, everybody. Thanks for the question. Two, I guess, really. One, when you think about the flow of information as it comes in both on the -- your enrollment assumptions and whether they're correct and then also on the risk pool itself and what's happening there when you think about claims experience, et cetera. How do you see incremental information developing? When -- at what point over the next 12 months do you think you'll have a pretty good sense that, hey, our estimates are pretty accurate on enrollment, our estimates about the risk pool are pretty accurate. I guess I'm trying to figure out, was that a fourth quarter of this year? Is it a first half of next year? Any thoughts on that? And then you've mentioned a couple of times some protection from being in a Medicaid corridor payable position. I guess, I'd love to get a little bit more color, if there is any, on how extensive that is across your Medicaid book rather and how much protection you think that provides on kind of deterioration in the risk pools?
Joe Zubretsky: A.J., I'll answer the second first. We talked about risk-sharing corridors during the pandemic that were introduced in a dozen of our states as a direct result of the pandemic. Reminding everyone that pre-pandemic, dating all the way back to earlier in the decade, various types of mechanisms existed in 17 of our states, MLR floors experience rebates. Those have always been in place. And because of our performance, we routinely pay into them. The better you perform, the more you'll pay into them. And the more you pay into them, the greater the cushion should your fortunes reverse later in the year. So we're not going to go through the actual numbers because it actually matters where you're in the money, in what state and it's way too difficult to project anything other than we have routinely paid into these mechanisms, the experience rebates, we did last year in 2022 because we were very profitable. Reminding you, we still have best-in-class industry margins even after having paid into them. And yes, should an inflection occur later in the year for whatever reason, redetermination for any other reason, these payables act as the first cushion to financial performance. Mark, do you want to take the question about what quarter we'll have visibility? We've talked about that a lot. And it’s might be third, more likely fourth.
Mark Keim: Absolutely. I mentioned that the majority of our states don't actually redetermine members. That is, take members off the roles until June and July. So we, across our 18 Medicaid states are very back-end loaded. That means the true data development won't really start to accrue until Q3 and Q4. Now remember, these states have a year to go through this process. Some will move a little faster, some will move a little bit slower. But picture on a weighted average going down over time, this data will start to develop, and I think we'll have a meaningful discussion in Q3 and Q4 on real data-driven insights.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Calvin Sternick with JPMorgan.
Calvin Sternick: Yes. Thank for the question. Sort of a follow-up to A.J's . In terms of the potential mitigants. As you go through the discussions of the states as they finalize their implementation plans for determinations, do you have a sense for how they're thinking about making the rate adjustments are most looking at it doing it on a retrospective basis? Or is it mostly perspective? And then do you have a sense for what level of margin degradation needs to occur before the state sort of look to step in there? And any color on whether like how many we could look to do it off-cycle versus how many would look to do on-cycle adjustments? Thanks. A - Joe Zubretsky Calvin, I'll start and I'll kick it to Mark for a more detailed discussion. But the timing of how the redetermination process is unfolding couldn't actually be better timed with the timing of our rate cycles. We have a September 1, we have an October 1. But for the most part, we're January 1. In early discussions with many of our states, they're willing to have discussions about both retrospective rate adjustments and prospective rate adjustments, and they're willing to have a conversation on-cycle and off-cycle. The conversations have been very productive. I can't speculate as to how much of an acuity shift would actually cause them to take action, but their actuarial resources, CMS's actuarial resources are all very much geared to engaging in a conversation both on a retrospective and prospective basis in both on and off cycle. As this information unfolds, we will be smack dab in the middle of our January 1 traditional rate cycle, which couldn't be better timing.
Mark Keim: Hi, Calvin, it's Mark. Joe got it exactly right. The majority of our states, the calendar year is the same as the fiscal year. Which means, if data is developing in the third and fourth quarters it positions you very well for an on-cycle rate review. Now at least two of our states have already committed to a mid-cycle rate review as well, anticipating that at least we should look at the data together. So we feel good about that. Overall, I think on the topic of retrospective and prospective, states have been really open to both. And in many cases, I think they're waiting for the initial gimps of data to decide on-cycle, off-cycle, retrospective, prospective, how they might do that. But the general signal from the states is very much of a partnership here to work through this rate cycle.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Sarah James of Cantor. Please go ahead. Sarah, your line is muted perhaps.
Sarah James: Yes. Sorry about that. So I wanted to follow-up on the timings. As far as your discussions with state goes, they have 12 months to get through the redetermination, but some of the states have been vocal about staffing issues on teams that would be evaluating that. So as you talk to them, what kind of color are they giving you on how ratable or front-end loaded their process might be? And then just to follow-up on your earlier bronze mix shift in the exchanges. Has that influenced how you accrue for risk adjusters versus past years, given the shift in metal tier? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Sarah, I'll answer the last question first, and Mark and I will tag team the question on timing. With respect to bronze, we've limited bronze to four markets, three markets require us to sell it. In Florida, we actually want to sell it because it's a bronze market, and it's very profitable. We sold more in Florida this year, which accounts for most of the -- the shift to bronze wasn't significant, but it was entirely accounted for our Florida sales efforts, and it's very profitable in Florida. It does add to the seasonality tilt since Bronze has higher deductibles. But we're very comfortable on the profitability of the bronze book because most of the states where we actually want to sell and try to sell. Mark, on the other question?
Mark Keim: Yes. Hi, Sarah. On your about timing, don't forget the states have 12 months from the end of the PHE to complete redetermination, the PHE ends in May. So even though some states began redetermination in April, the clock starts ticking as of May. So 12 months from May, I think there may be a difference between states intentions of how fast they move versus how fast they actually move. And we're seeing a little bit of that in some of our partnership discussions with them. So we'll obviously be accommodative of any schedule they want to roll out. But staffing issues, resource issues, it will be interesting to see how the next 13 months here play out.
Joe Zubretsky: I'll give you the editorial comment. We have not projected it to take longer than we said originally. But I expect that it would. And states are going to be -- most states will be very careful to make sure they don't strain members without coverage if they're in fact eligible. We're not projecting it to take longer, but it could be more back-end loaded than we have projected.
Sarah James: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Steven Valiquette: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. For the first quarter itself, Mark, you mentioned that the major medical cost categories were largely in line with your expectations. So I guess just trying to reconcile this with some of the strong inpatient and surgical volume growth trends coming out of the public hospital companies this quarter. Just curious if you can just remind us what magnitude you may have anticipated this and factor that into the guidance across the different books of business as far as any sort of extraordinary growth in inpatient? Medicaid and Medicare MLRs were still both up year-over-year in 1Q 2023 versus 1Q 2022 despite the MLR beat versus the street. But again, just curious how much elevated inpatient costs maybe not have been a factor in the MLR dynamics in the first quarter? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Steven, our medical cost trends were completely in line with expectations, flat in Medicaid, 2% in Medicare, 3% in Marketplace year-over-year. We saw an increase in utilization, but it's important to note when we say that to make the companion statement that expensive inpatient stays were down but less expensive. Our outpatient services, ambulatory services were up. So [indiscernible] were up, but the intensity of service and the types of services really reduce unit costs. Our trends were completely in line. We saw nothing in the quarter that wasn't expected or anticipated, trends are completely in line with what we assumed in pricing.
Mark Keim: Right. On inpatient, I hear you on the data points, but we're seeing just something just a little bit different. Lower surgical and obviously, lower COVID as the effects of the pandemic are diminishing, but also increasingly outpatient type of care for COVID cases. So as Joe mentioned, a fairly light trend for the first quarter.
Joe Zubretsky: COVID has gone from almost being completely and inpatient phenomenon to almost completely a laboratory phenomenon. You trade one inpatient -- the cost of one inpatient stay for one lab test all the time. So it has changed dramatically year-over-year, some pandemic-related and some just trend-related.
Steven Valiquette: Okay. That’s helpful. Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, our last question today comes from Gary Taylor at Cowen. Please go ahead.
Gary Taylor: Hi, good morning. Two quick ones for me. Just one, I think I missed just a little bit of the opening comment on exchange. So I just want to go back to that for a second. I know that trended better than you thought, but I didn't hear if that change where you thought you would land on your original 78% to 80% for the year. And then I just also wondered if anything you've seen so far makes you change your outlook on whether you have a receivable or a payable accrual in exchange for 2023?
Joe Zubretsky: Gary, our fast start to the year and the exchanges at 68.6% gives us great comfort that we'll operate at or below the low end of our long-term target range of 78% to 80% on the MCR. A little bit more seasonality due to the heavier than expected bronze mix, but completely in line with expectations. We are on target to hit our mid-single digit margin target for the year. With respect to the risk pool, the risk pool has really stabilized. A lot of the irresponsible pricing is out of the market. We have our arms around special enrollment. It's coming in at much lower levels due to the cutoff at 150% of FPL. So we have our arms around that. The risk pool has somewhat stabilized, which gives us really good visibility, not only into the acuity of our members, given that 75% of them are renewed members, but also two-thirds of them are in a silver product, which gives us the opportunity to optimize the value of a risk floor. We're in good shape on the marketplace so far, and we expect to operate at the low end of our long-term target range for the full year.
Mark Keim: The only thing I'd add to that is, with risk adjustment, the correlation between medical cost experience and risk adjustment at this point is pretty tight. So if the risk pool changes a little bit, I'm expecting effectively a hedge from our performance on risk adjustment.
Gary Taylor: And then just last quick one, if I could. You mentioned the prior period premium adjustments in Medicaid having impact on Medicaid MLR. I mean, presumably, there is a pretax earnings headwind that you bore in the quarter for that as well?
Joe Zubretsky: Yes. Given where we performed -- I'm sorry, we couldn't hear the first part of your, you're referring to Medicaid, correct?
Gary Taylor: Medicaid, yes.
Joe Zubretsky: Thank you. Yes. As I said, 17 of our states have always for a long period of time had mechanisms, experienced rebate mechanisms and minimum MLR mechanisms, which are set at pretty low levels, which allow you to actually earn excellent margins as we have been even though we still have been paying into these mechanisms. So yes, as I mentioned, last year, we had a good year and paid into them. And in the first quarter, again, good first quarter. We also paid into them in the first quarter. We don't disclose how much, but it's a routine part of the business. It's part of the overall earnings trajectory of how we think about the business and the first quarter was business as usual, excellent margins in Medicaid and still paid into these corridors and rabates.
Gary Taylor: Thank you
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session and today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. And have a wonderful day.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-09 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare’s Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Krocheski, Senior Vice President, Molina Healthcare. Please go ahead.
Joe Krocheski: Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare's fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our fourth quarter earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those of you who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made are as of today, Thursday, February 9, 2023. It has not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. On this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures for 2022 and 2023 can be found in our fourth quarter 2022 press release. During our call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our 2023 guidance, our projected 2024 outlook and revenue, our recent RFP awards, recent and future RFP submissions, including those in Indiana, New Mexico and Florida, our acquisitions and M&A activity, Medicaid lease terminations, our long term growth strategy and our embedded earnings power and margins. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report filed with the SEC, as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?
Joe Zubretsky: Thank you, Joe, and good morning. Today, we will provide updates on several topics. Our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022, our initial 2023 revenue and earnings guidance, our growth initiatives and our strategy for sustaining profitable growth, and our outlook on premium revenue for 2024, given our new business successes in 2022. Let me start with the fourth quarter highlights. Last night, we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.10, representing 42% growth year-over-year. Our fourth quarter 88.3% consolidated medical care ratio, 7.5% adjusted G&A ratio, and 3.9% adjusted pretax margin demonstrate continued strong operating performance. The fourth quarter completes another strong year of operating and financial performance. For the full year, we grew premium revenue by 15% to approximately $31 billion and grew adjusted earnings per share by 32% to $17.92. Our full year adjusted pretax margin of 4.4% was squarely in line with our long-term targets. Medicaid, our flagship business representing approximately 80% of enterprise revenue continues to produce very strong and predictable operating results and cash flows. For the year, we grew membership by approximately 10% and premium revenue by 21%, driven by the inception of our Nevada Medicaid contract, recently closed acquisitions and organic growth. The rate environment is stable and we are executing on the fundamentals of medical cost management. The full year reported MCR of 88% is at the low end of our long term target range and consistent with pre-pandemic levels, reflecting the underlying strength of our diversified portfolio and our focused execution. Our high acuity Medicare niche serving low income members representing 12% of enterprise revenue, continues to grow organically and demonstrate strong operating performance. For the year, we grew membership by 10% and premium revenue by 13%. Membership growth was driven primarily by our low income MAPD product, which more than doubled in 2022. The full year reported MCR of 88.5% was modestly above our long term target range, but includes approximately 300 basis points of pressure from COVID-related care. In Marketplace, the smallest of our three lines of business, we repositioned the business both in terms of its size in the portfolio and metallic mix. On a pure period basis, the business performed at roughly breakeven. While the financial performance did not meet our initial expectations for the year, we believe we have positioned our marketplace business to achieve target margins in 2023. Turning now to the execution of our growth strategy for the year. The successes in 2022 were many. On the M&A front, we closed on the acquisition of Cigna's Texas Medicaid business at the beginning of the year. And the AgeWell acquisition, at the beginning of the fourth quarter. In July, we announced the My Choice Wisconsin acquisition further adding to our market leading LTSS franchise. Our performance on Medicaid RFPs in the year was exceptional. We renewed our contract in Mississippi, doubled the size of our California contract for 2024 and won two new contracts: first in Iowa and then Nebraska for a 100% win rate on RFP responses submitted. In total, we project that these RFP wins for the year will add $4.4 billion in run rate premium revenue. In summary, our full year 2022 enterprise results continue to demonstrate our ability to produce excellent margins, while expanding our franchise by growing premium revenues. Turning now to our 2023 guidance. You can easily see the results of the repeatable earnings pattern we have created. We built new store contract backlog and harvest the earnings as the contracts and acquisitions mature. Meanwhile, we continue to focus on the operating fundamentals and drive operational improvements, which allows us to grow the core business at attractive margins. With regard to our 2023 guidance, we project 2023 premium revenue of $32 billion, representing a 19% compound annual growth rate since our pivot to growth in 2019. The 2022 earnings per share of $17.92 serves as a solid high margin earnings jump-off point. We expect that $1 per share of prior embedded earnings will emerge into 2023 earnings. We expect to produce $1.50 per share of core growth and operational improvements. We expect all of these elements will combine to produce 2023 core earnings per share of at least $20.40, offset by $0.65 per share of one-time contract implementation costs, which results in our 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $19.75. The operating improvements supporting the margins in our guidance are durable. The various elements which could impact earnings, COVID, flu, RSV, any margin impacts from redeterminations have been considered informing our guidance. The metrics implied by guidance are squarely in line with our long-term target ranges. As our guidance produces a 4.7% pretax margin, with a growth rate of 14% in core earnings and 10% on a reported adjusted basis. This is an attractive growth profile in a model that is repeatable. In addition to the growth within our guidance, we continue to build an earnings base for the future in the form of our embedded earnings profile, which provides a forward view of our earnings potential beyond 2023. The new store component of our embedded earnings defined as earnings from achieving target margins on acquisitions and new Medicaid contract wins is now at least $4 per share. The ongoing net effect of COVID, which at this point is the continuing earnings impact from the three remaining risk corridors, adds $2 per share of additional upside to this figure. This latent earnings growth estimate does not take into consideration any future organic growth or future strategic initiatives. Turning now to our growth strategy. We have taken major strides toward our $42 billion 2025 premium goal. At this early stage, we already have a clear line of sight to $35.5 billion in 2024. The key to our strategy is balanced, a stellar record of new contract wins, Kentucky, Nevada and now filling in the middle part of the country. The doubling of the size of our California business, including significant expansion in Los Angeles County, preserving and securing all of our incumbent state contracts and no large reprocurements in the near-term, continuing to build the M&A pipeline as this aspect of our strategy has already produced seven transactions for $10 billion. in revenue. Not to mention, organic growth, one member at a time by focusing on greater member attraction and retention and overcoming the regulatory headwinds of redeterminations and pharmacy carve outs. With that as the backdrop, I will now provide an update on some specific in flight opportunities related to our long term growth strategy. At the end of January, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission posted a notice on its website indicating that it was issuing a notice of intent to award our Texas Health Plan, a contract for all of our existing eight service areas in the state. We expect to be able to provide more of an update once these contracts have been finalized and signed. Our RFP response for the Indiana LTSS program has been submitted, it is pending evaluation and subsequent award announcement. In New Mexico, the state announced it has terminated the RFP that was in process and according to their press release, intends to issue an expedited reprocurement as soon as possible. We have many other new state business development initiatives well underway, including the potential for expanding to our former nearly statewide footprint in Florida. Our growing Medicaid footprint still only represents half of the 41 states with managed Medicaid. With multiple new state RFP opportunities over the coming years, and our demonstrated capabilities, referenceability and track record, we remain confident in our ability to win additional new state contracts. Our acquisition pipeline remains replete with actionable opportunities. While the timing of transactions remains difficult to predict, the strength of our pipeline and our track record of success gives us confidence in our ability to drive further growth from this important element of our growth strategy. In summary, we are very pleased with our business performance and the progress made in 2022 on our growth strategy, which has created a solid and growing financial profile. At least $20.40 of core earnings per share and $19.75 per share of adjusted earnings in 2023. Current new store embedded earnings power of at least $4 per share with an additional $2 of upside, if and when the few remaining COVID era corridors are eliminated. And $35.5 billion of identified premium revenue in 2024. All of this is before any impact from the continued execution of our growth initiatives. Of course, we could not accomplish all of this without our excellent management team and dedicated associates now approaching 15,000 strong, who in concert with our hallmark, proprietary operating model and management process have produced these results. To the entire team, I once again extend my deepest thanks in heartfelt appreciation. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional insight on the financials. Mark?
Mark Keim: Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss some additional details on our fourth quarter and full year performance, our strong balance sheet and our 2023 guidance. Beginning with our fourth quarter and full year results, our consolidated MCR for the fourth quarter was 88.3%, reflecting continued strong medical cost management. For the quarter, flu, RSV and COVID-related medical costs in total were largely in line with our expectations, but the impact varied by line of business, with Medicare being disproportionately impacted. Our full year consolidated MCR was 88%. This result was consistent with our expectations and was driven by the continued strong performance of our flagship Medicaid business. In Medicaid, our fourth quarter reported MCR was 87.3%. This strong performance was driven by effective medical cost management, and favorable retroactive premiums. The net effect of COVID in the quarter was a modest 30 basis points within our reported MCR. Our full year Medicaid MCR of 88% was at the low end of our long term target range and consistent with pre-pandemic levels. In Medicare, our fourth quarter reported MCR of 91.8% was driven by higher COVID, flu and the mix effect of our significant growth in MAPD. During the quarter, the net effect of COVID was 300 basis points within our reported MCR. Our full year Medicare MCR was 88.5% modestly above our long term target range and was similarly burdened by 300 basis points of net effect of COVID. In marketplace, our reported fourth quarter MCR was 93.8%. The MCR was impacted by normal seasonality and increased utilization in a handful of markets. The net effect of COVID was approximately 50 basis points within our reported MCR. In the quarter, we also settled some provider balances dating to prior years, which disproportionately impacted our Marketplace MCR by approximately 300 basis points. Our full year Marketplace MCR of 87.2% exceeded our long-term target range and includes approximately 120 basis points of net effective COVID, as well as approximately 130 basis points from the impact of a 2021 risk adjustment true-up recorded in the second quarter. Additional drivers of our strong fourth quarter and full year results include a 7.5% fourth quarter adjusted G&A ratio, which was in line with expected seasonal expenditures related to open enrollment and spending on community and charitable activities. Our full year adjusted G&A ratio improved year-over-year to 7.1% as we remain focused on delivering fixed cost leverage as we grow, even while making the appropriate investments to sustain our growth. Fourth quarter and full year results also feature higher net investment income as expected from recent increases in interest rates. Turning now to our balance sheet. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, and we continue to be confident in our reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 47%, about three days lower sequentially. The decline was driven by the increased mix of LTSS claims, which settled more quickly, resulting from the closing of the AgeWell acquisition as well as an additional payment cycle in the quarter. Our capital foundation remains strong. Debt at the end of the quarter was 1.8 times trailing 12-month EBITDA, and our debt-to-total cap ratio was 44.9. On a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.5 times and 40.7%, respectively. Our leverage remains low. All bond maturities are long dated on average eight years and our weighted average cost of debt fixed at just 4%. In the quarter, we harvested $268 million of subsidiary dividends and repurchased approximately 590,000 of our shares. Parent company cash at the end of the quarter was $375 million. With substantial incremental debt capacity, cash on hand and strong cash flow to the parent, we have ample dry powder to drive our organic and inorganic growth strategies. 2022 full year operating cash flow was lower compared to the prior year, primarily due to the cash settlement in 2022 of large prior year marketplace risk adjustment and Medicaid risk corridor payments. Normalizing for the timing of these payments, 2022 operating cash flow was $1.6 billion. Turning now to our 2023 guidance, beginning with membership. In Medicaid, we expect organic growth, the midyear inception of the Iowa contract and membership from our My Choice Wisconsin acquisition to be largely offset by the second quarter resumption of redeterminations. We expect this to result in 2023 year-end membership of approximately 4.7 million members. In Medicare, based on our performance in the annual enrollment period, we expect to begin the year with 160,000 members and continue to grow during the year, ending 2023 with total membership of approximately 175,000 members. Our Medicare membership growth for 2023 is expected to be evenly split between our D-SNP and MAPD products. In Marketplace, based on open enrollment, we expect to begin 2023 with approximately 290,000 members, reflecting our pricing strategy to achieve target margins in this business for 2023. Accounting for a limited SEP and normal levels of attrition through the year. We expect to end 2023 with approximately 230,000 members. We continue to treat any marketplace membership from Medicaid redeterminations as upside to these projections. Moving on to premium revenue. Our 2023 premium revenue guidance is $32 billion, representing 4% growth from 2022 Our revenue guidance is comprised of several items, $1.2 billion for the full year impact of AgeWell and expected revenue from the My Choice Wisconsin acquisition when closed. $1 billion of organic growth in Medicaid and Medicare and $900 million for the midyear inception of our new Iowa contract. Several offsetting items include: $600 million for the known pharmacy carve-outs, $500 million for the impact of the resumption of redeterminations beginning in April, $600 million for the lower Marketplace membership, and $300 million in 2022 pass-through revenue that we don't expect to recur in 2023. Turning to earnings guidance. We expect full year adjusted earnings to be at least $19.75 per share. Our EPS guidance reflects the realization of approximately $1 per share of 2022 embedded earnings, consisting of the contribution from acquisitions and a portion of the net effect of COVID partially offset by the impact of redeterminations. To this, we add $1.50 for the underlying organic growth plus several operating levers, including our real estate reduction strategy, the full year effect of our PBM contract and net investment income, partially offset by the negative impact of known pharmacy carve-outs. These drivers combined to deliver core earnings per share of at least $20.40. Recognizing the one-time non-recurring implementation costs in 2023 for our new contract wins that we now project to be $0.65 per share, yields our 2023 earnings per share guidance of at least $19.75. Moving on to select P&L guidance metrics. We expect our consolidated medical care ratio to be approximately 88%, consistent with our 2022 results. We expect our adjusted G&A ratio to fall slightly to 7%, even while absorbing the impact of the one-time non-recurring implementation costs for our new contract wins. This reflects disciplined cost management and fixed cost leverage from our revenue growth. Excluding the new contract implementation costs, our adjusted G&A ratio would have improved year-over-year to 6.8%. The effective tax rate is expected to be 25.3%, adjusted after-tax margin is expected to be 3.5%, well within our long-term target range. Weighted average share count is expected to be 58.1 million shares. And we expect our quarterly adjusted earnings per share profile to be fairly flat over the year, with the first two quarters of the year at roughly $5 each. As Joe mentioned, our 2023 new store embedded earnings power is at least $4 per share and is comprised of at least $3.50 from our three recent new contract wins, and $0.50 per share for AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin acquisitions, achieving full accretion. We continue to carry approximately $2 for COVID era risk corridors providing additional potential upside to be at least $4 of new store growth embedded earnings. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for some concluding remarks. Joe?
Joe Zubretsky: Thanks, Mark. In looking back over the past five years, we pause briefly to reflect on our company's accomplishments. We won $5 billion in new Medicaid awards over the period and defended all of our existing contracts. We acquired $10 billion in profitable revenue. In short, we doubled the revenue base. We have produced industry-leading margins in our core products, averaging 4% to 5% on a pretax basis. The top line growth and margin expansion allowed us to grow earnings per share from a loss in 2017 to nearly $20 per share in 2023 guidance. We've ascended to Fortune 125 status and were promoted into the S&P 500. We have a pure-play government managed care franchise to grow and build on. We only take this retrospective journey to express our excitement, enthusiasm and energy for the next five years. There are so many more opportunities to continue to grow and expand our franchise. As we say here at the company, reaching milestones is not a cost for celebration, but a cause for consternation as reaching one merely marks the point in time to set new aspirational goals. We plan to share our view over the next five years with you at an Investor Day later this year. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Josh Raskin: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. So the guidance for the 2023 MLR is overall flat. I assume it would be fair to expect the Marketplace MLR to be down meaningfully. But even just based on size, probably not a meaning contributor. Would it be fair to assume that the Medicaid MLR embedded in there is actually up? And maybe you could help quantify some of those absolute changes by segment and maybe specifically how reterminations are impacting your view of the Medicaid MLR?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, Josh. That is correct. We are going to produce a consolidated medical care ratio of 88% in each of 2022 and our guidance through 2023. We get there in a slightly different way year-over-year. Obviously, with our repositioning of the Marketplace business, we're projecting that with pricing actions, with the small silver and stable strategy, we will bring that MCR down within the long-term range at the high end of the long-term range of 78% to 80%. Medicare slightly underperformed our long-term target for the year because of 300 basis points of pressure. We now project that Medicare will come into its long-term target range, perhaps in the middle of that range. And yes, because we have been outperforming our long-term guidance range in Medicaid, 80% of our revenue, we are forecasting a reversion to the mean, considering all the impacts of flu, RSV, COVID, any potential nuanced reaction to retermination process puts us in the middle of the range at 88.5%, our long-term range being 88% to 89%. So that's the line of business tail of the tape for MCR projection into 2023.
Mark Keim: That's right, Joe. Josh, it's Mark. Total guidance at 88% MLR. As Joe mentioned, each of the segments I've got pretty much right in the middle of long-term guidance. So think of Marketplace, 79% to 80%; Medicare Advantage 87.5% and Medicaid, call it, 88 5%. For weightings, pretty similar to what we had this year, probably about 5% marketplace, which is a little bit smaller as the portfolio about 13% Medicare Advantage, about 82% in Medicaid. So you round all that out. The only other thing I'd say is, we finished full year Medicaid in 2022 at an 88%. We're obviously in our guidance saying an 88.5% roughly for Medicaid. So that's an additional 50 basis points for new stores, who knows redetermination or just general conservatism, but that's how I'm thinking about the MLRs there.
Josh Raskin: Okay. So no specific explicit redetermination, but sort of capturing it in that 50 basis points of general conservatism?
Mark Keim: That's the way to think about it, Josh.
Josh Raskin: Perfect. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe I'll just -- I know it's a smaller portion, but on the public exchanges or marketplace, your decline in enrollment. I know you've been talking about for a while that for '23, you would price for margin. Are you surprised -- was that decline in enrollment consistent with what you thought. It seems like, as we hear from your peers and everyone, there's quite a divergence in and what people are seeing. Any comment you can make on what you saw in benefits as this market become very sensitive to slight changes because some people are showing huge growth, others are not. And I'm just trying to put that in perspective. And then you're saying you do not have any assumption that you'll pick up lives on the public exchanges as redeterminations play out. Can you give us a sense of what that might look like possibly if you're not baking in the guidance? And do you have any view? I know there's been a lot of discussion about how those redetermined lives when they come on the public exchanges might affect the risk pool, I'm assuming that net-net, because you don't have anything in there, you think it would be a positive for you, even if maybe they're a little sicker than your average person on the exchanges today. But anyway, just fleshing out some of the public exchange commentary.
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, A.J. The membership results starting the year with 290,000 members, finishing the year with 230,000 members. We'll aggregate to about $1.6 billion in premium for the year. And that was fully in line with our expectations with respect to our pricing strategy. Look, we're allocators of capital and this business has shown that due to the instability of the risk pool by the introduction of the special enrollment period and other factors that it does have some inherent volatility. There also has been some irrational pricing over the past couple of years. So pushing the pause button and going silver stable, in small was exactly the right approach and the business for 2023 has landed in a good place for us to achieve our mid-single digit margin target, if we conclude that the risk pool has stabilized due to the lack of government movement of the risk pool rules, pricing is rational, we likely would conclude to allocate more capital to this line of business and grow it again. Mark, anything to add?
Mark Keim: Yeah, A.J., good morning. As Joe mentioned, starting off with 290,000 members going down, I think, to 230,000 by the end of the year, really exactly what we expected. We put 9% rate into the market this year. If you look at the mix of what we got and the pricing we put into the market, so with 9% not surprised with that result at all. Now you asked about the MLRs. To the extent we pick up folks from redetermination, I'm expecting the MLRs coming over to be quite consistent with our underwriting range. Those folks will not be new to health insurance. They will not be coming in with pent-up demand. So I'm expecting a pretty stable pool as they come over.
A.J. Rice: Okay. That’s great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: The next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Justin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions on the numbers side. First, on Medicaid membership, can you give us the membership? I know it's going to be flat. You talked about some new growth of acquisitions offsetting redeterminations. Can you give us those numbers in terms of what you're expecting there for each of those buckets? And then, how should we think about redeterminations from '23 into 2024 in your mind? And then on the reserves, I've heard you talk about DCP and I saw in the release that you mentioned a bunch of payments in the quarter. I did go back and take a look at fourth quarter paid versus fourth quarter kind of reserved or medical costs, last year to this year, it didn't look like there was a significant change in paid claims as a percentage of total in the fourth quarter of this year versus last year. So hoping you could just flesh that out a little bit in terms of what you were seeing there? Thanks.
Mark Keim: Great. So a bunch there, Justin. Let me start with Medicaid. We ended 2022 with about 4.7 million members. As Joe mentioned earlier, I expect to conclude 2023 with about the same. We'll go in there. The moving pieces is redetermination probably around 300,000 or more coming off, but replaced by a number of good guys. For example, the Iowa acquisition about 200,000 members, the My Choice acquisition about 40,000 members; California fee-for-service coming in a bunch of offsets there. So pretty much flat over the year from a membership perspective. On the DCP, you're talking about and the payments related to medical expenses. In general, when I look at DCP and I look at our reserving, our purchase is the same. It's the same actuarial on leadership, same approach to development and our triangles, the same external audit review. So I feel very confident about our process. What has changed is, in the fourth quarter, we added AgeWell, which brought in the LTSS membership, that membership adjudicates a whole lot faster and pays a whole lot faster. We also had the extra payment cycle. So when I look at the fourth quarter, we actually paid more than what I recorded in medical expense. So that's driving a bunch of that DCP decline from 50 to 47. Hope that helps.
Justin Lake: Right. Thanks for the color.
Operator: The next question comes from Calvin Sternick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Calvin Sternick: Hey. Good morning. Just a quick follow-up. It sounded like you said if the marketplace was stable, you could look to grow it again next year. And that just sounds a little different than some of your previous comments where you kind of let the membership float up and down year-to-year. I just want to understand that in the context of your overall strategy. Is the growth outlook for Marketplace just based on your evaluation in the market this year, and that's something that you look to reevaluate next year or are you saying that you kind of want to grow Marketplace going forward.
Joe Zubretsky: Now in that line of business, we are going to look at the stability of the risk pool, chasing and moving target with respect to the government rules around who's eligible, how many people are eligible when they become eligible has thrown in the past couple of years, that risk pool into what we consider to be a period of instability. If that should stabilize and now we're convinced that the pricing that's put into the market by us and the competitors is rational. I've always said, we could put this business back into the growth category, allocate more capital to it and grow it, but grow it in a very responsible and measured way. So I'm not sure, we're seeing anything new, but right now, keep it small silver and stable until we conclude that we should allocate more capital to it and grow it in a very measured and responsible way. And that's been our strategy all along.
Calvin Sternick: Got it. And I know you're not forecasting growth from Marketplace from redeterminations. But just curious if you have a sense for what the recapture rate was pre-COVID. So when someone got redetermined in Medicaid, how long did they typically go uninsured before they got coverage elsewhere? And I guess how often are you able to recapture some of those members in a Molina Marketplace product?
Joe Zubretsky: The way I would answer that is one of the reasons we haven't forecasted to capture is because the data around how it's worked in the past is pretty imprecise. I mean we could create all the models with various scenarios. We decided not to forecast it. We have operational protocols in place with member outreach in the states that allow that through text, phone and mail to help members reestablish eligibility and if determined that they are ineligible for Medicaid but eligible for a highly subsidized Marketplace product, we will then warm transfer them over to our distribution channels for Marketplace and capture them in that manner. But because this is uncharted waters, it's just -- it's never been done before, we chose not to create a model and forecast it, but consider it as upside to our membership growth.
Calvin Sternick: All right. Great. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Scott Fidel: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I guess, I'll use my question just to try to fill out a couple of the other modeling elements for 2023. Just interested if you could give us your thoughts on operating cash flow, and then also investment income and interest expense for 2023?
Mark Keim: Sure. Scott, it's Mark. So when I think about operating cash flow, I focus on cash flow at the parent because that's what restocks my firepower. I expect to take pretty meaningful dividends. I've got a few acquisitions to pay for this year and I've got some growth organically that I need to fund. So all told, at the parent, I expect to have more than $0.5 billion by the end of the year. Interest expense, you can model going forward, you know my bonds, you know my rates. On interest income, that's a wildcard, right? We're all guessing on that. finishing 2022 with about $7.5 billion of cash and investments. I expect across 2023 to end the year with about $7 billion of cash and investments, including everything at the subs. Now the wildcard here is, what kind of an interest rate to put on that, right? We've had one Fed raise already this year. If you look at the Fed Funds future rates. We've got maybe one more raise coming and maybe one or two declines back half of the year. So how do I think about that across the year? Not quite sure. I think you could model any place between mid and high 2s on a yield basis and come out with a pretty credible interest forecast there.
Scott Fidel: Okay. Thanks. And just one quick follow-up question. Just on the M&A side, how you're thinking about the pipeline and sort of the pacing of engagement in 2023. Obviously, you've got some significant installations of new business in flight. So interested in how you're thinking about layering in M&A as well. Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Yeah, Scott. Even with the significant backlog of both integrations on in-flight acquisitions and new contract implementations and our new wins, we have continued to aggressively pursue the M&A pipeline. And nothing has really changed with respect to the appetite of single state operators not for profit plans to listen to the Molina story and want to be part of this larger enterprise, where they continue -- they can continue to fulfill their local mission and have access to the broad and deep capabilities and financial resources that we bring. So it's a great story and nothing has really changed there. I would say, given the size of the pipeline and the level of activity and the maturity of some of the opportunities, we feel very confident in some announcements here in 2023.
Scott Fidel: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Hall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Michael Hall : Hi. Thank you. Just wanted to touch on the marketplace, again and just ask about like what happened in '22. So at the beginning of the year, you're expecting 79% MLR, but Q2 I think there was a large miss really full year expectation to 84%. And then this past quarter, even excluding the 300 bps of scheduling past provided balances still ended up higher than expected. Now you're at 87% to end the year. So I thought pricing was more disciplined than you went through this major recalibration of your metal peers to cover. So I would have expected more MLR stability than what we saw. Could you walk us through about like what happened with Marketplace and why the large divergent from initial expectations?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure. And as we said in our prepared remarks, even with the exclusion of the one-time items, the COVID-related items the risk adjustment true-up in the middle of the year. And in the fourth quarter, the significant settlement of some prior year provider balances, we did not meet our expectations in marketplace. The continuing MLR drag from that significant SEP membership that renewed into the current year, continued to drag on the MLR. We now believe that the special enrollment period might produce this year 3,000 to 4,000 a month, where it was producing 20,000 to 25,000 a month and the height of the SEP gives the risk full more stability, and we're priced for it. So we did not meet our expectations even while ignoring the one-time items. But this year, we feel that with the high-single digit price increase, low-single digit trend, good visibility on our renewal membership to make sure we get appropriate risk scores that we're in good shape to hit mid-single digit margins in 2023.
Operator: The next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Stephen Baxter: Yeah. Hi. Thanks. I wanted to follow up on the Medicaid MLR question. I appreciate the color on your expectations. How should we think about Medicaid MLR? I know you probably want to guide it too close quarterly, but do you expect to generally operate around that 88.5 level kind of consistently throughout the year or is there any slope to that line that we should maybe be thinking about? And then just to kind of put a bow on the question on the DCP for the AgeWell business, could you just give us a sense of what the DCPs would look like on a stand-alone basis, we can try to put that into context? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: So I'll turn it to Mark. But yes, given the mix of the business has changed and many of the dynamics of the businesses have changed, the seasonal patterns of how MCRs emerge, has changed slightly over time. So I'll turn it to Mark to give you a view of how Medicaid might perform over the quarters.
Mark Keim: Yeah. I'm expecting pretty flat. And if you look historically, we've run pretty consistently on Medicaid, certainly more so than Medicare in the marketplace. So I think you can model that one pretty straight line. On the AgeWell, we'll follow up with you offline. I don't have a discrete number on that. I know what it does to my weighted average, but we can follow-up with that. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Nathan Rich: Great. Thanks for the questions. You mentioned the $2 per share of earnings power from the three remaining COVID risk corridors. What's the time line to potentially realize these earnings? And then just more generally on state rates, how do you think the process plays out for states potentially revisiting rates as redeterminations occur and potential changes to the underlying risk pools take place. How do you think the states are going to approach that? Thank you.
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, Nathan. We actually consciously separated the two major components of our embedded earnings because one of them is, in our view, entirely controllable, harvesting the $4 of earning our target margins on latent contracts and M&A is something we have a proven track record of doing. We separated that from the $2 of lingering COVID era corridors because eliminating them is outside our control. They were put in place during COVID. They're articulated as being related to COVID. There are three remaining two that matter. Washington, State of Washington and Mississippi, and we believe over time that they will either be compressed or eliminated, but we don't control that. With respect to rates, I would say that states, our customers and their actuaries are vary at least aware of the potential for an acuity shift somewhere due to the redetermination process. And the fact that they're aware of it. And we would -- and if or not, we will certainly make them aware if we experience it, leads us to believe that if there is a significant shift in acuity somewhere in the book of business that the actuarial soundest principle will prevail, and we'll be able to have a productive conversation about that.
Mark Keim: Nathan, just to build on that, a number of our states were in 19 on Medicaid now. A number of our states have told us, if and when there's any impact from that redetermination, they are quite willing to reopen that to revisit it. So we feel good between that commitment and our advocacy efforts that the rates will move as they need to.
Nathan Rich: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Gary Taylor with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Gary Taylor: Hey. Good morning, guys. Most of my questions are answered, just two quick ones. One on the exchange membership loss driven by repricing. Is there any particular state you'd point out in your footprint or is that pretty evenly distributed that rate increase in the enrollment decline? And then just secondly, because 99% of all the incoming investor angst about Molina is around redetermination risk and potential impact on margins, et cetera. Just wondered if you could share with us any additional work you've done on low utilizers, zero utilizers, people, populations most likely to be redetermined, et cetera? I know you've shared some of that before and just anything else you might add to provide some comfort around your Medicaid, MLR guide would be helpful, I think. Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Gary, I'll answer your second question first and then kick it to Mark for more detail. But the analysis that we've shared with you and investors is the same one, because we're looking at all the data. And there's so many theoretical arguments of why an acuity shift could happen. We focus on the numbers and the data. We look at members greater than one year duration, less than one year duration. We look at the MLR for members with less than one year duration, greater than one year duration. We look at members with zero to 25% MLRs. We look at the lapse rate of membership, which hasn't gone to zero. There still is a disenrollment rate that occurs in the Medicaid book. So we look at all that data, and it leads us to believe that while maybe somewhere there could be a slight acuity shift probably in the expansion book, not in the tenant book or the ABD book, but manageable and will be easy to deal with, particularly because the states are aware of it and we believe we'll have a productive rate discussion if and when there is a shift in acuity that makes the rates actually unsound. Mark?
Mark Keim: Yes. So we update this analysis every quarter and the conclusion is really not changing. Joe mentioned a couple of the data points, the folks with us more than one year versus less the folks in the zero to 25% MCR bucket. Expansion, we're seeing a little bit of an increase, but across the board is not much. Remember, expansion is just 30% of our total revenue. The other data point that some folks have been talking about is coordination of benefits or duplication of benefits, do we see any increase in that population. Once again, not really, a little bit of an expansion. So across the board, is there something here? Maybe, but it's really minimal. So again, not expecting much of an impact here to the extent it plays out. Now I refer back to the previous question, where I think the states are quite amenable to revisiting it. On your first question, are we fairly even distributed on our Marketplace? Yeah. I don't see any real estate density in any outliers of one state being disproportionately dense. We've got pretty good distribution across our 14 states here.
Gary Taylor: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Steven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning. So just a follow-up question on the exchange business. Here you mentioned the shift from bronze to silver has been the right move the better margin profile demonstrates that. So I know you talked about this more a year ago, but just remind us again why bronze has proven to be more tricky from your point of view. Has that gotten better or worse currently versus a year ago? What would have to change within that just to give you comfort to reexplore bronze on a greater level? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Steven, it's really an anomaly of the product design, not anything that we design, but the way the product is priced from an industry perspective, where one thing I can point to that is absolute fact is for the same member in bronze and silver with the same acuity level, the same services and therefore, the same HCCs, the risk score produces less revenue in bronze than it does in silver. And there are other aspects of it that make it just slightly less attractive. Mark?
Mark Keim: Yeah. I'd say a couple of things just building on Joe's thoughts. It's a lower actuarial value product. Sometimes that attracts folks that don't think they're going to use a product but do, the way the rules are set up, the balance on risk adjustment is a whole lot better on gold and silver than it is on bronze. And finally, just at a lower revenue load, it becomes slightly less attractive from a G&A perspective and some of our other operating ratios. You take those things all together, it's more volatile, and we just don't see the margins there.
Steven Valiquette: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Mr. Hill, I'm not sure, some trouble hearing you. All right, your connection may have gone down. We'll go to the next questioner, who's Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Kevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. One quick clarification question before I jump into the real question. The $6 of embedded earnings, it wasn't 100% clear to me. Is that in addition to the $0.65 coming back or is that $0.55 in the 3.50?
Mark Keim: So the total of $6 is $4 of new store EPS; $2 of net effective COVID; and there are two other items in there that cancel each other out. There's the implementation costs, which are a bad guy in the current year of $0.65, but go away next year, right? And then, there's also the remaining hit on redetermination of expecting in 2024, which is also $0.65. So those two cancel each other out, you're looking at $4 and $2.
Kevin Fischbeck: Okay. So that $6 on the current guidance is not on the 20, 40 earnings power number.
Mark Keim: Correct.
Kevin Fischbeck: All right. And then I just want to go back one more time to the redeterminations because it's interesting because on the one hand, it sounds like you thought about redeterminations as a potential MLR pressure in your Medicaid MLR guidance, which is different, I think, than how you've talked about it in the past, but then throughout the call, you've kind of dismissed it as a potential pressure to MLR. So just trying to understand a little bit finer like are you saying you've put it in, but you think it's set most 10 basis points or something like that, something kind of immaterial or how exactly are you thinking about and what exactly are you including in this year's guidance? And then I guess to build on that, if it is a pressure this year, would you expect that pressure to be higher or lower next year? Higher because more members are being determined or lower because states have more time to adjust rates? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Kevin, I'll give it to Mark. We are not and haven't parsed all the specific trend factors that go into an MCR forecast for the Medicaid business, but we have been outperforming even the low end of our range, a range which produces best-in-class industry margins and we just think it's not prudent to continue to forecast that we'll continue to outperform the outperforming that range. So we call it a reversion to the mean. We're forecasting an 88.5% for the Medicaid business, which is right in the middle of the range, citing medical cost pressures due to any of the items like flu, COVID, RSV and then, of course, any pressure that might be experienced with an acuity shift knowing that a significant acuity shift will probably be absorbed by retroactive rate increases. So I'm not going to parse it, but that's why we were somewhat conservative in forecasting the middle of our long-term Medicaid range rather than continuing to forecast that we outperform it.
Mark Keim: That's exactly right. So we finished last year at an 88% for the year. Our guidance anticipates an 88.5%, and we don't attribute any specific basis points to a driver. But in general, reversion to the mean flu, RSV, number of different things we could think about in there. Don't forget, we also have some new stores coming along, Iowa, the acquisition of My Choice Wisconsin. In general, just a little bit of conservatism, reversion to the mean, not attributing any basis points specifically to redetermination. But look, we've all had the conversation enough. We're acknowledging that, that's something that's potentially in there. in our reversion to the mean. Now you also mentioned maybe what happens next year. So to the extent any of this starts to manifest it will largely be back-end loaded in the year, just given the way redetermination is going to play out. I think that gives all of us a lot of time to anticipate it but just as much work with our state partners to make sure that rates in the concept of actuarial soundness anticipate the same thing.
Kevin Fischbeck: All right. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
George Hill: Hi, guys. Is it working better this time around?
Operator: Yes. Thank you, sir.
Joseph Zubretsky: Yes, we hear you.
George Hill: Okay. Thank you, guys. Joe, and I think you kind of just touched on this in the last answer, but my question was around the $0.65 in implementation costs in 2023. I guess could you kind of break out the buckets that they're typically going to fall into. And again, this was just commented on, but I assume no part of that repeats in '24 that all goes away and there's no part of that cost structure that's durable.
Joe Zubretsky: I'll answer the last part of your question first. On the cost for -- obviously for Iowa, California and Nebraska, yes, those once spent should not repeat themselves. But as I said many times, and not tongue in cheek, I hope in the future, we continue to have one-time implementation costs on new contract wins can have a better spend than that. There are technology implementations, which are fixed in nature. And then, of course, you need to hire the people that are going to service these businesses in advance of the revenue stream, which is a major part of the $0.65 implementation cost. Mark?
Mark Keim: Right. I'll just build on that. So if you think about the $0.65, the way I think about it, about a third of it is IT, sort of a fixed component and about two-thirds of it is staffing, mostly highly variable, right? We have to staff up ahead of day one membership. So that's the way to think about it. It obviously, it comes to us ahead of when we start booking revenue. So I wouldn't say that it goes away specifically. What it does is it goes into the anticipated margin once we run these businesses. We've talked about $3.50 of same-store -- of new store embedded earnings here. That $3.50 is, of course, after operating costs. The reason we have $0.65 is we're not booking revenue yet. So $0.65, one-third, fixed; two-thirds variable, that's the right way to think about it.
Joe Zubretsky: Yeah. It goes away as a one-time item, but it becomes consumed into the run rate of the new contracts is the way to think about it.
George Hill: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our last question comes from David Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Windley: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I hope you can hear me. I have a few small ones. In your discussion around, the state's willingness to revisit these rates, as redetermination progresses. Do you have a sense of the urgency around that? Meaning, will they do that on a relatively short notice or will they want to have that discussion in the next rate cycle or after the majority of the redetermination in their state has played out.
Joe Zubretsky: We don't know that specifically. All we know is that they're aware of the theoretical possibility that there's an acuity shift in the book, likely, could result in prospective rate changes, but also retrospective rate changes. And it all has to be data driven. So to the point on timing, the data has to mature. The claims have to complete, the data has to be analyzed and then reasonable people will get in a room and figure out whether a rate change is necessary. So I would look at it, I don't know whether they're going to wait until the entire redetermination process is complete. But it's got to be data driven. So the data has to complete, and it has to be verifiable and actionable.
Mark Keim: And David, it's Mark. The fact that a number of these states have also led with this thought, unprompted to me is encouraging that will be somewhat proactive here.
David Windley: Okay. That's interesting. Second question is any thoughts on trends post-COVID in medical costs that are more durable and maybe distinction as to whether you're betting on that or not. So thinking about things like lower ER utilization and that type of things.
Joe Zubretsky: No, I think the medical trends we've experienced late in the year seem to have fallen into a nice pattern of, lack of volatility and understanding what COVID is actually costing sort of like on a run rate basis. It almost evolved into a $40 million to $50 million monthly run rate. And as long as it stays stable, as long as we know where the COVID infection rate is spiking, it certainly is -- the inpatient cost is certainly the more costly component, and that certainly hits the Medicare more than the Medicaid book. We have pretty good line of sight into what those services will cost us. But late in the year, it sort of settled into a nice pattern of $40 million to $50 million a month.
David Windley: And then lastly, Joe, I appreciate your comments on your -- it sounds like your M&A pipeline is still very robust. Does the cost of capital change in the environment impact cadence or appetite? Has it impacted expected valuation on the seller side?
Joe Zubretsky: No, not at all. We obviously measure the returns against our weighted average cost of capital. Obviously, we're earning more on the free cash now than we were before. So there's less of a drag. But no, it hasn't caused any change in momentum in terms of the appetite for counterparties in the market to want to speak to us and think about becoming part of the Molina enterprise.
David Windley: Great. That’s all I had. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and Molina Healthcare's fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-27 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Molina Healthcare Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Krocheski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Joe Krocheski: Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our third quarter earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made are as of today, Thursday, October 27, 2022, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. On this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures for 2022 can be found in our third quarter 2022 press release. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of our adjusted earnings outlook with GAAP measures for the years beyond 2022 without unreasonable efforts due to the difficulty of predicting the timing and amounts of various items within a reasonable range. During our call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our 2022 guidance, our long-term growth strategy, our recent RFP awards and RFP submission and the projected revenue and earnings growth associated with these awards, our outlook with regard to both fiscal year 2023 and 2024, our acquisition and M&A activity. The COVID-19 pandemic can redetermination and our current and future competitive earnings power and margins. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise the listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report filed with the SEC as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?
Joe Zubretsky: Thank you, Joe, and good morning. Today, we will provide updates on several topics, our financial results for the third quarter of 2022, our full year 2022 guidance in the context of our third quarter results, our growth initiatives and our strategy for sustaining profitable growth. Our outlook on 2023 premium revenue and earnings growth and lastly, given our recent new business success and early outlook on premium revenue for 2024. Let me start with the third quarter highlights. Last night, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.36, representing 54% growth year-over-year. Our earnings growth reflects strong premium revenue growth, sustained target margins and the realization of a meaningful portion of our 2021 embedded earnings. Our third quarter 88.4% consolidated medical care ratio, 6.9% adjusted G&A ratio and 4.3% pretax margin demonstrate strong operating performance even as we navigate prolonged pandemic-related challenges. Our year-to-date performance, highlighted by an 87.9% MCR, a 6.9% adjusted G&A ratio and a 4.5% pretax margin is squarely in line with our long-term targets. This reported pretax margin increases when normalized for the effects of revenue pass-through payments and the marketplace prior year risk adjustment true-up previously reported. Medicaid, our flagship business, representing approximately 80% of enterprise revenue, continues to produce very strong and predictable operating results and cash flows. The rate environment is stable. COVID costs have tempered and we are executing on the sound fundamentals of medical cost management. The year-to-date reported MCR of 88.2% is at the lower end of our long-term target range, reflecting the underlying strength of our diversified portfolio and our focused execution. Our high acuity Medicare niche serving low-income members, representing 12% of enterprise revenue, continues to grow organically and demonstrate strong operating performance. The year-to-date reported MCR of 87.4%, even with sustained cost pressure from COVID-related care is fairly in line with our long-term target range. Marketplace, at 7% of enterprise revenue, continues to track towards a return to profitability in 2022 on a pure period basis. We have succeeded in keeping the business small, keeping it silver and keeping it stable. In summary, we are very pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. We executed well, delivered solid operating earnings and continued to deliver on our growth strategy. Turning now to our 2022 guidance. We now project our 2022 premium revenue to be approximately $30.5 billion or $500 million above our previous guidance. From the time of our pivot to growth in 2019, this updated 2022 revenue guidance represents a 3-year, 23% compound annual growth rate. Excluding the estimated impact of the redetermination pause, our 3-year compound annual growth rate is 19%. In addition, we have increased our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance to at least $17.75. This represents a $0.75 per share increase compared to our initial 2022 guidance despite absorbing an additional $0.50 per share from the net effect of COVID and $0.44 per share for the prior year Marketplace risk adjustment true-up. As we prepare to head into 2023, we have a very solid earnings baseline off of which to grow. Turning now to an update on our long-term strategy for sustaining profitable growth. We are executing well on the many dimensions of our growth strategy. On the RFP front, we continue to build on our track record of success in both retaining our existing Medicaid contracts and winning new ones. The quarter's highlights were many. In Mississippi, Molina was selected to continue serving Medicaid members across the entire state. In California, we've not only retained our current footprint, but we're also selected to serve the important county of Los Angeles, which will add significant membership in premium revenue. In Iowa, we were awarded a new statewide contract entering as one of 3 managed care organizations serving a total managed Medicaid population currently at 800,000. And we were awarded a new statewide contract in Nebraska as one of 3 managed care organizations serving a total managed Medicaid population currently at 360,000. Once it commences in January 2024, the California contract award is projected to provide membership growth, measured on current membership roles in excess of 1.2 million members as well as the associated significant premium revenue growth. This projection is based on the state's own published county-by-county Medicaid membership count. We were 1 of 2 plans selected in each of Sacramento County and San Diego County, which are existing Molina counties, but where we now expect additional membership in 2024. We were also selected to be the sole commercial health plan in Los Angeles County, which is a 2-plan model county. Finally, we also won awards in both San Bernardino and Riverside Counties known as the Inland Empire, where we expect our current membership levels to remain the same. With awards in each of these 5 California counties, we were successful in being selected in every county on which we bid. We are very confident in our ability to operationally prepare for this expansion. We have a deep knowledge of the [Medicare] program, and we have an existing long-term presence in Los Angeles. We have already commenced the 15-month build-out for this significant expansion. In combination, all of these contracts will expand our Medicaid portfolio to 20 states. These new contracts are expected to add approximately $5.8 billion in annual premium revenue and at least $3 of earnings per share, once we achieve full run rate margins. Looking forward, our RFP response has been submitted for [Texas STAR+PLUS]. It is pending evaluation and subsequent award announcement. We believe we are well-positioned to retain this contract due to our track record of operational and clinical excellence, standing and reputation, cutting-edge innovation and the demonstrated ability to right winning proposals. With multiple new state RFP opportunities over the coming years, we remain confident in our ability to win additional new state contracts. We have submitted our proposal for the LTSS contract in the state of Indiana, and have many other new state business development initiatives well underway, including the potential for returning to New Mexico and expanding to our former nearly statewide footprint in Florida. In summary, our track record of success validates our long-term revenue growth strategy and its value creation potential. Before I turn to some further particulars regarding our outlook for both 2023 and 2024, I want to briefly put a point on the magnitude of the company's achievements in the third quarter and what those achievements mean for the future of our company. Stated at a high level, the new business wins will have a profound impact on our company over the next few years. As a matter of year-by-year sequencing, in 2023, we will be busy scaling our proven operating infrastructure to service this new revenue, incurring front-end implementation costs. In 2024, we expect to achieve full run rate contract revenue with earnings beginning to emerge from this significant new revenue. And finally, in 2025, we expect to achieve our full run rate target margins. Against the background of this sequencing and high-level view, I will now provide some color regarding our 2023 outlook. 2023 will be an important year as we prepare for our new revenue growth. We will be hiring and training additional staff to expand our already expert teams and extending our systems to ensure ample capacity. We expect that the onetime nonrecurring expense in 2023 associated with this robust growth will be $0.75 per share. Given our strong current performance, we are raising our 2023 core earnings outlook, the earnings that would have been produced by our company before these recent wins from at least $20 per share to at least $20.25 per share. This core earnings outlook, a meaningful measure of underlying performance, represents 14% growth on today's updated 2022 guidance of at least $17.75 per share. When we include the onetime nonrecurring $0.75 per share implementation costs, our reported earnings per share outlook for 2023 is now at least $19.50. Turning now to our premium revenue outlook for 2024. While it is far too early to provide specific financial guidance for 2024, we do have line of sight to many of the premium revenue growth drivers that we expect to materialize in 2024. First, we expect to continue to grow organically in our current geographic footprint. Second, we expect our recent RFP wins in California, Iowa and Nebraska as well as our AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin acquisitions to be operating at or near full run rate revenue. And third, we expect that these growth drivers will be partially offset by the impact of redeterminations and through potential pharmacy carve-outs. Combined, these revenue building blocks create an attractive growth trajectory and path to at least $37 billion in premium revenue in 2024. With over a year to go, additional M&A announcements and new Medicaid procurement wins would add to this already attractive 2024 premium revenue picture. A few words on our embedded earnings profile, which provides a forward view of our earnings potential beyond 2023. As previously described, the $5.8 billion in incremental revenue in 2024 from our recent RFP wins adds at least $3 per share in incremental earnings. These earnings are anticipated to begin to emerge in 2024 when all of our new RFP wins will then be operational. With this $3 per share addition, our total 2023 embedded earnings power is now nearly $6 per share. This is strong latent capacity to achieve our near- and long-term earnings objectives. In summary, we are very pleased with our business performance and the exciting developments over the past few months. Combined, this has created a solid and growing financial profile, at least $20.25 per share of core earnings in 2023, $37 billion of premium revenue in 2024. 2023 embedded earnings power of nearly $6 per share and all of this is before any impact from the continued execution of our growth initiatives. Of course, we could not accomplish all of this without our excellent management team and dedicated associates, now approaching 15,000 strong, who in concert with our hallmark proprietary operating model and management process, have produced these results. To the entire team, I once again extend my deepest thanks and heartfelt appreciation. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional insight on the financials. Mark?
Mark Keim: Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss some additional details of our third quarter performance, our strong balance sheet, our updated 2022 guidance and some additional color on the revenue and EPS building blocks driving our outlooks for 2023 and 2024. Beginning with our third quarter results. In Medicaid, our reported MCR was 88.5%. This strong performance squarely in line with our long-term target range, was driven by strong medical cost management. The net effect of COVID in the quarter was a modest 10 basis points within our reported MCR. Year-to-date, our reported MCR was 88.2% and at the lower end of our long-term target range. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 88.7%, a figure which is above our long-term target range, driven by higher COVID and non-COVID utilization. During the quarter, the net effect of COVID increased our reported MCR by 350 basis points. Despite continuing COVID-related utilization, our year-to-date reported MCR of 87.4% was squarely in line with our long-term target range. In Marketplace, our reported third quarter MCR was 86.3%. Similar to previous quarters, the MCR was impacted by higher utilization and approximately 90 basis points of net effect of COVID. We remain on track to return our Marketplace business to profitability on a pure period basis in 2022. Though it varies by business, in aggregate, the net effect of COVID was consistent with our expectations and decreased net income by $0.59 per share in the quarter. Our full year outlook for the net effect of COVID remains unchanged at $2.50 per share. Additional drivers of our strong third quarter results include a 6.9% adjusted G&A ratio, a 40 basis point improvement over the prior year third quarter and higher net investment income from recent increases in interest rates. Turning now to our balance sheet. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, and we continue to be confident in this reserve position. Days and claims payable at the end of the quarter was 50%, consistent with prior quarters. Our capital foundation remains strong. Debt at the end of the quarter was 1.7x trailing 12-month EBITDA, and our debt-to-cap ratio was 44.2%. On a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.5x and 41%, respectively. Our leverage remains low. All bond maturities are long dated on average 8 years and our weighted average cost of debt fixed at just 4%. We harvested $120 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter. Parent company cash at the end of the quarter was $298 million. With substantial incremental debt capacity, cash on hand and strong free cash flow we have ample cash and capital to drive our organic and inorganic growth strategies. Now a few comments on our updated 2022 guidance. We increased our full year premium revenue guidance by $500 million to approximately $30.5 billion, driven by 3 components: approximately $200 million for the third quarter outperformance, approximately $200 million for the addition of AgeWell, which closed October 1; and approximately $100 million to reflect the impact of the latest extension of the public health emergency through January and the related delay in resuming redeterminations, which we now expect to begin in 2023. We also raised our full year 2022 adjusted earnings guidance by $0.15 per share to at least $17.75. The increase is driven by several items. Third quarter outperformance of about $0.15 per share, margin on the additional revenue from the extension of the public health emergency, which we estimate at about $0.05 per share and additional net investment income of approximately $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter, driven by the recent rise in interest rates. Partially offsetting these items is approximately $0.15 per share of expected higher G&A, driven by fourth quarter marketing and open enrollment activities as well as the recent new contract wins. Turning now to our earnings outlook for 2023. Based on the expected timing of the known revenue building blocks, our initial outlook for 2023 premium revenue is approximately $31.5 billion. We are increasing our 2023 core EPS outlook. The earnings before the onetime nonrecurring implementation costs to at least $20.25 or 14% growth compared to our updated 2022 guidance. Our earnings growth outlook reflects several drivers. First, we expect a portion of our 2022 embedded earnings to [emerge] in 2023. Second, the attractive growth in our current footprint and the associated margin, partially offset by potential pharmacy carve-outs will yield incremental earnings in 2023. Third, a combination of new operating catalyst should enhance our 2023 earnings growth, including our recently renegotiated PBM contract, our expected real estate reduction, and finally, we expect higher interest rates to translate into correspondingly higher net investment income. Recognizing the onetime nonrecurring implementation costs of $0.75 per share on our new contract wins in California, Iowa and Nebraska, yields our updated outlook of at least $19.50 per share for 2023. Our evolving outlook for 2023 will be informed by our performance in the fourth quarter of 2022 as well as the enrollment season for Medicare and Marketplace and the ongoing execution of our strategic initiatives. As Joe mentioned, our 2023 embedded earnings power is nearly $6 per share, made up of the following components. We start with our previously reported 2022 embedded earnings of $3 per share, we add at least $3 per share of earnings from our recent new contract wins, we decreased it by $1 that is now in our 2023 outlook, and finally, we add the implementation costs for new contracts of $0.75 per share to recognize the onetime nature of IT platforms, program enhancements and several months of staff ramp-up. Now some additional color on the premium revenue outlook for 2024. The following building blocks provide a path from our expected 2022 premium revenue of approximately $30.5 billion to $31.5 billion in 2023, and to ultimately, at least $37 billion of projected revenue for 2024. First, we expect approximately $5.8 billion of premium revenue from our 3 recently announced Medicaid contract wins. This projection includes a conservative estimate of the impact from redeterminations and is composed of $3.6 billion in California, $1.6 billion in Iowa and $600 million in Nebraska. Based on contract inception dates, we expect a portion of Iowa premium revenue to emerge in 2023, while we expect the premium revenue from California and Nebraska to be realized in 2024. Second, we expect organic growth in our current footprint of $1.7 billion, consistent with underlying growth in rates and membership. Third, the incremental premium revenue for the full year impact of AgeWell and the My Choice Wisconsin acquisitions is expected to be approximately $1.4 billion, most of which will emerge in 2023. Partially offsetting these growth drivers are 2 regulatory impacts. Approximately $1.6 billion for the impact of redetermination, which we expect to emerge evenly between 2023 and 2024 based on the latest outlook for the end of the PAG in January. And approximately $700 million of pharmacy carve-outs, most of which will emerge in 2023. Of course, continued execution of our strategic initiatives creates upside to this revenue outlook. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Josh Raskin at Nephron Research.
Josh Raskin: Question I want to say on L.A. County on the win there and maybe you could speak to the preparations for that contract implementation. I'm specifically interested in network development and provider contracting and then infrastructure build-out. And I'm curious if there's a potential deal with the incumbent to help accelerate that readiness or you think you guys can do it all on your own?
Joe Zubretsky: Josh, this is Joe. First, I would answer your second question first. All that is to be determined. As you know, in past contract wins, both here and in the industry, that is certainly a possibility, but I'll leave that to further discussion. On the preparation, we've been in California for 40 years. We know Sacramento and San Diego very well. Our membership is likely to double there. We'll scale up. And so we don't see much of a big and heavy lift for Sacramento and San Diego. Bear in mind, we are in L.A. County. We're a subcontractor to the current commercial plan. We know the providers, we know the landscape and we're really confident that with 15 months to prepare, we have the 3 things that you need to be ready on day 1. We have the time, we have the money and we have the know-how. And we will be fully ready on 1/1/24 to handle the significant new membership in LA County.
Josh Raskin: Perfect. And then just that $0.75 then, is that a charge that you guys expect to be taking? Or is that just additional costs born through the P&L that you're calling out?
Joe Zubretsky: Well, I think, managerially, it's a charge. I mean it's a cost that has to be incurred in advance of the revenue showing up, but we have to take it through earnings. 1/3 of it is IT scaling. The other 2/3 is staff. Take the variable cost of running $6 billion of revenue and look at having 2 to 4 months of that cost paid for trained and ready to go in advance of the contract. And you can see how easily it's going to cost $60 million pretax and $0.75 a share.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research.
Justin Lake: First off, maybe you can walk us through the components of the $1.7 billion of organic growth. Maybe just price and membership growth along your 3 business lines?
Joe Zubretsky: Justin, I'll turn it over to Mark, and he'll be able to peel that back for you.
Mark Keim: Sure. When we think about the $1.7 billion of organic growth, that was a 2-year number from our build that's looking over 2 years. Justin, we typically think of 3% to 4% organic growth on an annual basis. Generally, that's about half membership and about half rate. In a year, that's more or less. We're in a lower rate environment right now, which certainly matches trend. But you can do a little bit of math on our current book and work with those organic growth numbers. The other thing that you'd want to stack on top of this, as you think about that organic growth rate is you have to adjust for some of the pass-throughs that we have in our book right now. We've got about $500 million of pass-through revenue this year. So of course, that's going to make a year-over-year comparison less than it might otherwise look because that's not a recurring item, right? Then the only other thing to think about on organic growth is, as Joe mentioned many times on Marketplace, our Marketplace strategy is not to grow ambitiously. So I would not put a meaningful growth rate or any growth rate necessarily on Marketplace year-over-year. But I think if you add those things together, you'll get very close to the 1.7 number I talked about.
Justin Lake: Great. And then just lastly, there's I know the folks who didn't win in California are trying to get a stay from a judge on the award and then go to court. Is there anything that you could share with us on timing on what we might hear from that? And how that might play out?
Joe Zubretsky: No, Justin, this is Joe. We won't comment specifically on the protest process itself, but with all 3 awards. We believe that the RFPs were thoughtfully designed and well executed by the various states and that our proposals were effectively judged on their merits. We are very familiar with the protest processes in these various states and are actively engaged and well-resourced to handle it. And right now, we're heads down, preparing for day 1 implementation. We're pretty confident that many of these protest processes will not be protected and come to culmination and an answer in due course very soon.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Nathan Rich, Goldman Sachs.
Nathan Rich: If I could ask a follow-up on the new contract wins. Could you talk about how the margins on that contract ramp up in 2024 and beyond. It looks like you're targeting about a 4% margin on that new business. Can you talk about maybe what we should expect in 2024 versus the years beyond that?
Joe Zubretsky: First, Nathan, this is Joe. Your math is correct. The $3 sort of implies a 4 percentage point pretax margin, 3 percentage points after tax. And I will -- the first thing I'll say before kicking it to Mark, is we generally do not impute fixed cost leverage on either our acquisitions or new contract wins. So that's a fully loaded margin, fully burdened with all the fixed costs to run the business. Obviously, with $6 billion of incremental revenue, growing our Medicaid book of business [true-up] by 25% in a short span of time, we expect to get a significant amount of fixed cost leverage off these installations but we kind of hold that back. We'll report it when we realize it, and it will either drop to the bottom line or potentially offset perhaps other pressures in the [MLR]. Mark, anything more on the margins on the new wins?
Mark Keim: No, that's exactly right, Joe. The 3% is fully loaded. As we've said numerous times with fixed cost leverage, we would ideally see a few bps go to the G&A ratio. But this is conservative and assumes maybe that you give a little bit back in rate. But nevertheless, a conservative view on outlook -- now part of your question might have been 24 ramp into 25 run rate. The 3% is a conservative view of run rate. On the 24, how does that ramp up? It's interesting. Some markets, if folks are new to Medicaid, they can come in hot in the '90s for the first couple of quarters. Other markets where people have been in Medicaid and are quite used to the product and on normal utilization. They'll come in more at the normal run rate. So to be conservative, I'd say that the [MLRs] will be a little bit hotter than we aspired to. Remember, 88% to 89% is our longer-term Medicaid outlook. Would they come in a little hotter than that in the first year? Maybe. But I wouldn't think too much. And so conservatively, we say it takes a year to get to our run rate there.
Nathan Rich: Great. And if I could just ask a follow-up. You called out some continued pressure from COVID in the quarter, I think, particularly on your Medicare business. Have your expectations changed at all for COVID and maybe flu as we think about the fourth quarter and then into '23, both on the COVID front as well as non-COVID utilization, any changes there to your assumptions?
Joe Zubretsky: No, I think our outlook for COVID remains the same. It's going to cost us $2.50 a share. And generally, what's been happening is the direct cost of COVID-related care, which have been pretty modest quarter-to-quarter have been nearly -- entirely offset by what we call COVID-related utilization suppression. And therefore, the net COVID cost has been the amount of outperformance in our Medicaid contracts that goes into the risk-sharing corridor. So our outlook on that hasn't really changed. Yes, we are expecting a normal flu season for 2022 into '23. $40 million plus is a normal flu season for us. It went to nearly 0 in the first flu season after pandemic. It's now increased to about half the normal size at about $20 million, and we expect it to go back to $40 million plus into next year, fully baked into our forecast.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Stephen Baxter of Wells Fargo.
Stephen Baxter: Congrats on the Medicaid wins. I think you guys mentioned in the prepared remarks, potentially this being a little bit of a lower rate environment on the Medicaid side. I was hoping you could give us a sense of how you're thinking about the outlook for rates inside of your guidance for the next couple of years. And then separately, I was hoping you could give us an update on the total amount of Medicaid premium return you expect to see in 2022, both for COVID era provisions and also for any preexisting provisions that were in the states?
Joe Zubretsky: Stephen, I think the summary comment on the rate environment, it's continued to be stable and rational. The traditional process of establishing a credible medical cost baseline, a trend off that baseline, adjusting for changes in the acuity of the population and carve-in and carve-out benefits has been tried and true and supported this business well for decades, and that's the traditional process that is used. As we indicated many months ago, the risk-sharing corridors that were introduced during the pandemic to capture [software] utilization have generally subsided. There's 3 remaining. And we'll play it by year in terms of whether those persist into the future or not. So the rate environment is very stable, very traditional process of establishing a cost base line and a trend off that baseline. And I would say, the overall rate environment is stable. I had trouble hearing your second question, but I'll kick it to Mark. I think he has it.
Mark Keim: Yes. Just on the Medicaid revenue build, I'll work off 2024 just for the full picture. We talked about $5.8 billion from the 3 new states. The acquisitions will add $1.4 million, that's AgeWell, which is about $0.5 billion on top of this year and My Choice, which will be the full $900 coming in -- full $900 million. Other components of Medicaid revenue build redetermination across the 2 years, I see revenue headwinds of $1.6 million. And we mentioned in the prepared remarks, that would be split between the 2 years pretty evenly, we expect. Then finally, we have mentioned 2 pharmacy carve-outs that will affect our Medicaid revenue for about $700 million across the 2 years. You put your best assumption on the organic growth for Medicaid, and I think that would give you the components of the Medicaid building blocks.
Operator: And our next question today comes from A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse.
A.J. Rice: I know you're saying that particularly for next year on the Marketplace, you're not assuming a lot of growth there. Any comment on where you think the margins will go and what your objective is there longer-term as well? Any updated thoughts?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, A.J. Our outlook for the margins of the Marketplace business is mid-single digits on a pretax basis. This year, we expect to be profitable on a pure period basis, eliminating the effects of the prior year risk adjustment true-up which we experienced in the second quarter. We break even in this business at around 84%. So if we can operate between 80% and 83%, we think we can push the business to mid-single-digit pretax margins. And I will mention 2 things. The SEP membership that we are attracting this year is far lower than the SEP membership we attracted last year. We are attracting 25,000, 30,000 a month last year, and it's barely 25,000 to 30,000 a quarter. That SEP membership, as we said last year, it usually comes in with higher acuity. So that's in check. And secondly, as a reminder, we put 13 to 14 points of rate into the market. We've looked at our competitive positioning and looking at where our product now stands against the competitors, and we're pretty confident that we've maintained our competitive position in many of our larger markets and have no reason to expect that our membership will meaningfully increase or decrease as a result of our competitive positioning.
A.J. Rice: Okay. And then I know in your prepared remarks, you talked a little bit about reverification impact being spread over '23 and '24. Any updated thoughts about looking at it today. Obviously, we did have a 3-month delay on the PAG. And I don't think you guys have talked -- any updated thoughts about how much would be in '23 versus '24 and where you ultimately land. And then I don't think you've talked much about recapture with your Marketplace offering. Do you think you'll recapture any of the lost lives?
Joe Zubretsky: On the second point, our redetermination forecast on how much revenue we will likely lose as a result of people becoming ineligible does not include a recapture on Marketplace. We're holding that as upside. It's very hard to forecast who is going to be eligible for a highly subsidized Marketplace. We believe many of them will. We have operational protocols in place to warm transfer ineligible Medicaid members over to our Marketplace business. So it remains upside to our forecast. I'll turn it to Mark to give you how the revenue emerges over a 2-year period.
Mark Keim: Yes. Just as a reminder, the most recent extension was on October -- mid-October to mid-January. We expect that the earliest states would start to redetermine then a month later in February and expect them to do it in a straight-line basis, more or less, across the year. CMS has required states to be done in 1 year, whether they can do that or not remains to be seen. But let's assume that they get there across 12 months. We're currently carrying roughly 750,000 members since the start of the pandemic. Our assumption, A.J., is that at the end of the year, we will have retained 50% of them and lost only 50% to redetermination. I model a PMPM across the book of about $3.75 on these. So when I do the math, the total revenue loss would be $1.6 billion. But remember, that's spread across 2 years. While the membership comes down this year, the revenue was half this year and half next year. If you look at the member months, so call it 0.8% this year, 0.8% next year, back to that into your revenue models. And of course, the member months will support all that.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America.
Kevin Fischbeck: Great. I just wanted to make sure I understood the $6 in earnings power fully. So I guess, first, you guys said -- I believe that you started with the $3 that you have this year at the $3 on the new business, that makes sense. But then you said if you took $1 out of the existing $3 and added back to $0.75, I just -- I don't know where that dollar that you're taking out is from? Is that from the COVID bucket from the deal bucket? How should we think about that? And then I guess we're applying this to $6 to the $19.50, I just want to make sure we have the right base to think about with the earnings power.
Joe Zubretsky: Kevin, I'll turn it to Mark. The $0.75 charge actually creates a little bit of complex -- accounting complexity here, but it's either $5 per share or $5.75 depending on whether you're pro-forming the $19.50 or the 2025. So we're just under $6 per share at $5.75 have been better earnings when compared to the $19.50 of reported earnings for next year. Mark?
Mark Keim: Yes. So let me walk you through that. In our last call, we talked about $3 of embedded earnings. As Joe mentioned, we're increasing that by an additional $3 to recognize the run rate of the 3 new states. So we're at $6 currently. The dollar that comes down -- excuse me, we're going to put $1 into our guidance -- our outlook for next year. It's a combination of the acquisitions and the net effect of COVID. I'm expecting about $0.50 to come off the net effect of COVID that we're currently carrying. I'm expecting to realize about $1 of the acquisitions that are in our embedded earnings. And then finally, on redeterminations, $0.50 will go the other way. In my embedded earnings, I'm carrying $1 -- a negative $1 on a redetermination $0.50 of that's going to go into our outlook for next year. So you add that up, that's the dollar. Then finally, we're recognizing the $0.75 of onetime costs. So that gets you to $5.75 million to $6 a dollar for what we're putting into our outlook, increased it for $0.75 for the implementation cost that gets you to $5.75. And to be very clear, that $5.75 is off the $19.50 of adjusted earnings outlook.
Joe Zubretsky: The other thing I would say about embedded earnings just to put a point on it, I just want to make sure we don't get to caught in what I'll call false precision here. Our embedded earnings concept, given the historic nature of the pandemic and then the incredible growth we've had due to acquisitions and new contract wins, is to give our investor base a view of the future earnings power of the business, whether it's $5 or $5.75 or $6, it's sitting on top of $19.50 or $20.25 of earnings per share in 2023 and should give you a pretty good leading indicator of where the business is headed. Now I would further say on embedded earnings. Embedded earnings is really only theoretical unless you have a history and a track record of harvesting it. And when you look at our earnings per share track record of going from $13 per share to $17 and now to $20, we -- this is not theory. This is actual embedded earnings due to timing, which is yet to be harvested, and we have every full intention of pulling that through.
Mark Keim: Joe, I'd just put a point on that. A year ago, we had more than $6 of embedded earnings and 4 of that went into current year performance. So it's quickly converting into real earnings.
Kevin Fischbeck: That's really helpful. And I guess just as far as the redetermination dynamic, we're still talking about a revenue dynamic. You guys still feel pretty comfortable that there shouldn't be any margin implications from redeterminations? And I know you shared some data in the past. Is there anything that you would point out to is kind of giving you confidence that there won't be a margin implication from a risk pool dynamic?
Joe Zubretsky: We continue to look at the data. And we see -- we do see increased duration across our products. It's not as much as you might think because the disenrollment rate is still pretty high. Nonutilizing members are off but only up modestly and longer duration members do have more favorable [MLRs]. This really doesn't affect the ABD population because they're chronic, that's 1/3 of the revenue. And so if we do have any pressure, we're likely to see it in the expansion population, but we expect it to be minimal. Mark?
Mark Keim: That's exactly right. I studied this across the second and third quarter, it's quite in-depth. On members that are with us for longer than 1 year, of course, they're up. But as Joe mentioned, they're not up as much as you might think because the disenrollment rate is actually quite meaningful still. It's not like no one leaves. We still have meaningful disenrollment rates. So what we look at is the members with no claims, it's up a little but not that much. Some folks have also looked at the members in the 0 to 25 MLR range. That's up kind of like the no claims cohort, but not that much. When we then model through what the impacts are, as Joe mentioned, ABD really hasn't changed. That's a very stable group of folks. It's really in the expansion population that we expect to see some impact, but that's 30% of our revenues on a weighted average basis. I'm not seeing a meaningful impact here.
Kevin Fischbeck : Can I just follow up on that? Because the point about 0 utilizers, I guess, it doesn't take much of the increase your utilizers to have an increase on -- or an impact on MLR like if you had 90% MLR and then the following year, 50 basis points, more people had 0 reserve utilizers, wouldn't that take your MLR down by 50 basis points and take your Medicaid earnings up by over 10%? Like when you say there's just not a big delta in your utilizers, like what are we -- are we talking about 10 basis points? Are we talking about 100 basis points and when you say that you mean like the expansion? Or do you mean like overall across the entire book of business?
Mark Keim: In expansion, it's fairly slight. But the other thing is what are they changing to? If there are 0 utilizers now, if they go to 90%, to your point, that's a big impact. But if they're going to anything in between, obviously, the weighted average impact not so much. And again, more to the point, if it's mostly an expansion, which is 30% of our book, the impact gets greatly diluted.
Joe Zubretsky: And of course, the underlying assumption is that even if those low utilizers, the percentage did change, the underlying assumption that is being made is those are the ones that are going to leave and there's really no evidence. We always have 0 utilizers. We always have low MLR members -- and there just is no statistically relevant data that suggests that, that's going to put pressure on the MLR.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Steven Valiquette at Barclays.
Steven Valiquette: Great. So just regarding the L.A. County Medicaid contract award. I mean, every state is a little bit different in how they handle the outcome of a successful appeal under that [indiscernible]. So I guess my question really is just around the scenario analysis, just to confirm that one way or the other. I guess is the scenario that your new award in L.A. County could be 100% completely reversed by a successful appeal by the incumbent? Or under the other scenario, does Molina stay in place as a new plan sponsor no matter what. And the incumbent would just be added back in as an additional plan sponsor over and above the existing awards and to sort of dilute the membership you would gain otherwise? Just curious to get the thoughts on that. And also for the other state awards too, if there's any just high-level color on that as well.
Joe Zubretsky: I'll answer the last part of your question first because there was an important data point that just emerged Tuesday. And that is the one protest in Nebraska was denied on Tuesday. That's public information. So I'm not announcing anything that's private. And whether that goes through an appeal process or other administrative processes, I don't know. But that was -- that protest was denied on Tuesday. With respect to your question, I don't want to speculate. I think it would be actually inappropriate for me to speculate what the state of California, the Medicaid department and the administration would do during the protest process. I think there are ranges of scenarios of outcomes. The one we're planning for is that our award was in a well-structured thoughtfully design process. It was evaluated on its merits, and we are heads down preparing for day 1 implementation to make sure that members have access to services, providers have their questions answered, our staff is fully ramped up, and that operational excellence has been our hallmark. So I think it would be improper and perhaps even speculative for me to contemplate what the state might decide. I think there's a range of options. But right now, we think that we're going to be in business in L.A. County on 1/1/24 and getting ready to do so.
Steven Valiquette: Okay. All right. So it sounds like it's still TBD. Okay. That's helpful.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Scott Fidel at Stephens.
Scott Fidel: I was hoping maybe you could just do a quick diagnostic for us. Just when we look at the recent success that you just had in the RFPs and really was quite substantial. And Joe, I know that sort of fixing and accelerating the RFP capability has been a key strategic priority really since you came on board. But really just sort of seem to just really hit its stride more recently. So if you had to pick 2 or 3 things that you think of just resonated in particular with the states in these recent awards, would be helpful to hear about that. And then how transferable do you think those are to somebody's big RFPs that are still ahead in Florida and Texas.
Joe Zubretsky: Yes. Our new business development capability, it's really an apparatus. I mean it's a business unit, and there's a playbook. The playbook [indiscernible] go into the state 2 years in advance in anticipation of an RFP developing the relationships with providers, with community leaders and really getting an intense understanding of the hot buttons of the state and what particular -- what their particular concerns are with respect to their Medicaid population and their Medicaid program. Whether it's our government affairs engine, whether it is our community involvement engine, our network developers. And secondly, I would say that it's -- and our proposal writers, which we've proven that we can write high-quality proposals that are easy to understand and that score really well. But I will tell you, the key to writing a great proposal is actually being able to stand behind it and actually perform and the referenceability of our national capabilities, social determinants of health, managing high-acuity populations, opioid use disorder, substance abuse and other types of behavioral conditions, our ability to value-based contract, I mean, it's one thing to write well to innovation. It's another thing to be able to stand behind it with referenceability. And as a pure-play Medicaid player, our skills and capabilities are entirely referenceable, are playing really well and seem to be winning.
Scott Fidel: And if I could just ask one separate follow-up just back on the exchanges. And I know that you're really trying to manage the membership and keep this exposure relatively limited. But obviously, 2023 is going to be a pretty unusual year with some of these really aggressive players like Bright now exiting the market, which is going to going to put a lot of membership back sort of into the pool. So how are you approaching that? I mean we did see in the landscape data yesterday that 14% premium increase you talked about and that your premiums are pretty conservative versus the market. But you probably can still end up right with adding a lot of membership potentially. So just interested in how you're sort of thinking about that sort of incremental enrollment and then managing sort of trying to keep the business still relatively low exposure?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, Scott. And we did see that note and we thought it characterize our approach perfectly that we priced for margin and not to grow market share in this business. With respect to the market exits that you've read about, we've mapped our footprint to the companies that are exiting. There's not a lot of overlap there. Where there is, CMS has sort of "assigned" or at least suggested to various members that they move to a Molina product, but it's measured in the thousands, not the tens of thousands. We still don't know what the overlap is in Texas. We haven't seen the data yet. But all in all, I would say that the market exits should not have a meaningful impact on whatever our growth rate is going to be next year, the market exits should not have a meaningful impact. And yes, you're absolutely right, we priced purposely to produce mid-single-digit pretax margins, but the revenue fall work made.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Calvin Sternick at JPMorgan.
Calvin Sternick: Sort of related on the Marketplace. I know you talked about positioning that sort of complementary to Medicaid and not really looking to grow it. But if you hold on to California, do you think you'd get maybe a natural lift in that business? Just having the overlapping Medicaid and Marketplace products in that county?
Joe Zubretsky: Yes, Calvin. One of the things we haven't talked about yet because right now, job one is to scale up our operations in California to handle the Medicaid membership, job one. But yes, L.A. County, in particular, has a very high concentration of D-SNP members and Marketplace participants. And while we have those products in California, because of our small presence currently in L.A., I wouldn't say that we have a large LA presence in those 2 products. But yes, we would quickly evaluate whether we would -- once we're comfortable, we've got the day 1 readiness in place, fully scaled and operating well in Medicaid, we would absolutely evaluate whether our Medicare product and our Marketplace product would be -- we followed the same pattern we followed across the country, plant the Medicaid flag come in with our ancillary products and build a robust and diversified product portfolio. I would consider that upside to the growth case, but we have not included it in our current estimate.
Calvin Sternick: And is that something that you think about as maybe being a 2024 opportunity? Or is that more 2025, just given that there is the protest, it could go to court and you have to submit your Medicare bids by middle of next year. Because what are you thinking on the timing?
Joe Zubretsky: Well, right now, we're planning that we will be implementing our Medicaid contract on 1/1/24. That's what we're planning on. And let's assume that happens. I would say that we would not be -- we haven't valued in this yet, but I think would be pretty quick and pretty early to then be filing 2 ancillary products 6 months later until we know that we've got the Medicaid population well serviced and operating excellently. So I would say, just off the top of my head now that you've asked, it would probably be more like a '25 filing for '26, and not '24 to '25.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Dave Windley at Jefferies.
Dave Windley: Joe, I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on M&A environment in terms of opportunities, valuation expectations, then also higher cost of capital environment. a lot of organic scaling on your plate? Just what are your thoughts about continued M&A?
Joe Zubretsky: I'm sorry, David, I couldn't hear the last end of your question, continuing to do what.
Dave Windley: What are your thoughts about continuing merger and acquisition activity for you.
Joe Zubretsky: Thank you. Well, with all the new contract wins, we didn't spend a lot of time during this earnings report to talk about M&A. But I will tell you, the portfolio, the pipeline continues to be very robust with the same type of bolt-on tuck-in acquisitions that have been our hallmark. We're up to about $10 billion of revenue purchased. We've only allocated capital. We've only cost us about 22% of revenue, which includes regulatory capital. And we've gotten every dollar of accretion we promised and more out of these acquisitions because we turn our operational leaders and their playbook on some of these underperforming properties and we get them to target margins rather quickly. So we have ample capacity, as Mark talked about in his prepared remarks, ample debt capacity, great cash flows. We're in no way capital constraints to continue on the growth trajectory. We've had 18% to 19% growth since our pivot to growth in 2019. We promised 13% to 15% at our Investor Day. We produced close to 20%. We can continue to grow at this rate, either by acquisition or by organic or by new contract wins and continue to fund this growth from existing cash flow and debt capacity.
Mark Keim: Just to put a point on that, Dave, the pipeline is robust. At any given point, we're relationship building. We're in discussions with numerous targets out there. So I'm very encouraged by that. On a capital perspective, looking out over the next 18 months, I feel very comfortable with our capital position. Just organically, we can self-fund most of anything I see in the pipeline between the capital commitment I need for these new procurement wins as well as the capital for some of the potential M&A. I see ample organic cash flow and capital to support all that without even going outside. Now I wouldn't say I would never go outside to raise more capital. But with everything I see over the next 18 months, we can self-fund all that growth, and we're still looking at our M&A pipeline to see what else is there. So we feel pretty good about that outlook.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Michael Hua Ha of Morgan Stanley.
Michael Hua Ha: Appreciate the question, and I appreciate all the new guidance update details. Clearly, a lot of new embedded earnings. But when I think about '23, it looks like there's potentially even more tailwinds that could drive upside to your new guidance, upside from recapturing redetermined lives in your exchange book, that's not in your guide, family glitch fix benefit potential benefit to your exchange Medicaid book if recession picked up, maybe better net investment income and rising rates. So are any of these items actually included in your new guide? Am I missing any other tailwinds that could drive upside? And on the headwinds, drive from redetermination in Florida rate cut, pharmacy carve-outs are there any large headwind buckets that should be on our radar?
Joe Zubretsky: I think I'll take it and hand it to Mark to give you the tail take. But as we said, when you're trying to bridge from the $17.75 of earnings per share guidance for this year to the $19.50 reported for next year or 2025 core, the components are harvesting a component of embedded earnings, organic growth, which we have a great track record of harvesting, significant operational catalysts that Mark mentioned during his prepared remarks, and then, of course, we do expect a tailwind from interest rates given the short-dated nature of our portfolio. So Mark, why don't you take through the numbers?
Mark Keim: Great. As Joe mentioned, starting from $17.75, as I've mentioned, about $1 comes in from our embedded earnings. It's a little bit off the net effect of COVID. It's the M&A portion that's yet to be realized. And then it's a little bit of a headwind on redetermination in 2023. Organic growth, we talked about that, which is just the recurring growth of rates and membership. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the operational catalysts, the PBM renegotiation and the upside on that, the real estate rationalization, which I expect to address here at some point in the fourth quarter. Investment income, definitely upside on that. We manage an $8 billion portfolio today split between cash and longer-term investments. Who knows where short-term rates are going. But certainly, on the cash portion, our net investment income is very responsive to those rates. So I think some nice upside there. All those things bridge you to the 2025 core number that Joe mentioned the $0.75 gets you back to the $19.50. Michael, you addressed a bunch of the things that are potentially. We're still working through on the Marketplace, how will open enrollment work, more importantly, on redetermination. What is the cross-sell opportunity as folks come off Medicaid, maybe into Marketplace, that's all upside. We don't assume any of that in our outlook. -- you certainly hit on the net investment income upside. We continue to work through this rate environment as we go into the new year, most of our rates aren't known definitively. We work through that as we go, so that's something we're thinking about every day. But as Joe mentioned, those rates need to be tied to trend, that's an actuarial requirement. So let's see where trends in rates move. That's one thing that's still evolving in our outlook. But overall, I think you got the core components there, and you mentioned a number of the potential items on top of it.
Michael Hua Ha: Just a quick follow-up on organic growth, if I may. Just specifically on Medicare Advantage. I think you mentioned last quarter, 7% revenue growth on both yield and membership. If I'm not mistaken, that would imply roughly low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth. But based on the landscape, it looks like you're targeting pretty strong footprint [indiscernible], doubling your accounting footprint in nondual moving entirely to 0 premium plan, raising your maximum out-of-pocket. But overall, at first [plant], it looks like your offering has improved pretty significantly. You've taken big steps and geographic expansion. So just curious, your thoughts on membership growth next year have been improved since last quarter.
Joe Zubretsky: I think from a footprint perspective, counting the number of counties can actually give a misleading answer because we're only probably at about 50% or 60% of the Medicaid counties. However, were in counties that cover 90% of the population. So we're pretty well saturated and penetrated in the Medicaid counties, which is our strategy, follow bring D-SNP into where you're concentrated in Medicaid. Our strategy is very simply is to grow at low teens rates in Medicare. It's a low-income offering, D-SNP, we have our demonstrations, which are basically auto assignment and you roll with the auto assignment algorithms of the federal government. And then, of course, we did launch what we call traditional Medicare Advantage, but it is a low-income strategy. We're not trying to compete with the big guys who are going after affluent seniors. We're targeting people that have enough resources to operate just above the D-SNP income levels and wherewithal levels, but still need a Medicare Advantage product. So it's still a low-income niche offering, and we expect to grow, as we said at our Investor Day, at low teens rates.
Mark Keim: And just 2 things to put a point on that. The service area expansion was largely for the '22 year. For '23, we're not seeing a meaningful service area expansion. And I know you know this, when you look at our growth rates on the Medicare segment, the growth that Joe is talking about is related to the Medicare Advantage and D-SNP products. The other half -- more than half of that segment is the MMP product, which, of course, has a different growth characteristic being a close block of business. So I know you know that dynamic, but it's important to think about the 2 components of growth separately.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, our final question today comes from Joseph France with Luke Capital Markets.
Joseph France: I just want to follow up on Scott's first question in response, which were both very helpful. Would you tell us about the scope of your subcontractor relationship with the commercial plan in Los Angeles?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure. It's -- there's one commercial plan in Los Angeles. And we are a subcontractor meaning in return for a percentage of the premium we service the members. It's under 100,000 members. But we know the environment very well. But it's a very small relationship. It's only a couple of hundred million dollars in premium, and I believe that latest count that I've seen is we're probably at around 70,000, 75,000 members in that book of business. So it gives us familiarity with the territory. Obviously, we have a big installation there with respect to headcount footprint. So we know the area very, very well. But that relationship while it gives us the familiarity that's going to help us scale up, it's financially very small.
Joseph France: So it really had no bearing on the RFP itself.
Joe Zubretsky: I couldn't comment whether it did or not, but I would suspect that that's correct.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session and today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-28 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Molina Healthcare Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Krocheski, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Joe Krocheski: Good morning and welcome to Molina Healthcare’s second quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina’s President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our second quarter earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made are as of today, Thursday, July 28, 2022 and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our second quarter 2022 press release. During our call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our 2022 guidance, our 2023 outlook, our growth strategy and expected growth, our RFP submissions, the COVID-19 pandemic, our acquisitions, our future margins and embedded earnings power and our long-term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report filed with the SEC as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?
Joe Zubretsky: Thank you, Joe and good morning. Today, we will provide updates on several topics: our financial results for the second quarter 2022, our full year 2022 guidance in the context of our second quarter results, our growth initiatives and the reaffirmation of our strategy for sustaining profitable growth, and an early outlook on 2023 premium revenue and earnings growth. Let me start with the second quarter highlights. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.55 for the second quarter, with adjusted net income of $266 million on $7.8 billion of premium revenue. Second quarter adjusted earnings were decreased by $0.44 per share for a true-up to our 2021 final Marketplace risk adjustment transfer payments. Excluding this out-of-period item, our adjusted earnings per share was $4.99. Our 88.1% total company MCR in the second quarter demonstrates strong operating performance even as we navigate prolonged pandemic-related challenges. As Mark will describe later, the reported MCR included increases related to the 2021 Marketplace risk adjustment true-up and the accounting impact of a revenue pass-through. As such, our underlying pure-period MCR was 87.2%. Similarly our reported pre-tax margin of 4.4% increases to 5%, which is at the top end of our long-term target range. For the quarter, we produced 18% premium revenue growth and 34% earnings per share growth. Our year-to-date performance highlighted by an 87.6% MCR, a 6.9% adjusted G&A ratio and a 4.7% pre-tax margin is squarely in line with our long-term targets. Adjusting for the Marketplace risk adjustment true-up and the accounting impact of the revenue pass-through, our underlying pure-period year-to-date MCR was 87.2%. Year-to-date, we produced 19% premium revenue growth and 21% adjusted earnings per share growth. Medicaid, our flagship business, representing 80% of enterprise revenue, continues to produce a very strong and predictable operating results and cash flows. The rate environment is stable, COVID costs have tempered and we are executing on the sound fundamentals of medical cost management. The ongoing and consistent high earnings quality in the first 6 months produced at reported MCR of 88.1%. Our diversified geographic footprint and mix of products, including management of high acuity members, provides us with an excellent earnings ballast. Our high acuity Medicare niche serving low-income members, representing 13% of enterprise revenue, continues to grow organically and outperform our long-term target margins. The year-to-date reported MCR of 86.7%, even while still pressured by the cost of COVID-related care, is below the low end of our long-term target range. Each of our products, D-SNP, MAPD, WEDI/SNIP and MMP, contributed to this favorable result. Marketplace at 7% of enterprise revenue is tracking to return to profitability in 2022 on a pure-period basis. We have succeeded in keeping the business small, keeping it silver and keeping it stable. The true-up to 2021 risk adjustment is largely due to the surge of special enrollment period membership that we experienced in the last half of 2021. On a pure-period basis, 2022 is on track to achieve a low single-digit pre-tax margin. In summary, we are very pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date performance. We executed well, delivered solid operating earnings and continued to deliver on our growth strategy. Turning now to our 2022 guidance, we now project premium revenue to be approximately $30 billion or $750 million above our previous guidance. Our updated 2022 guidance represents a 3-year 23% compound annual growth rate since our pivot to growth in 2019. Excluding the estimated impact of the redetermination pause, our 3-year compound annual growth rate is 18%. We are also increasing our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance to at least $17.60. Our increased 2022 outlook features strong premium revenue growth of 12%, which includes the impact of our conscious decision to reset the size and scope of our Marketplace business, a pre-tax margin at the midpoint of our long-term guidance range, and strong earnings per share growth of 30%. We have purposely remained conservative in our full year 2022 earnings guidance. Our year-to-date underlying performance is highlighted by effective management of medical costs, both COVID and non-COVID, that were favorable to our expectations. In this environment, which is still being affected by the emergence of new COVID variants, it is prudent to remain cautious in forecasting medical cost trends. In the first half of the year, for Medicaid and Medicare, which account for 93% of enterprise revenues, we produced MCRs at or below the low-end of our target ranges. We believe it is prudent to project MCRs to be within the target range for the second half of the year. Bear in mind that our target MCR ranges result in industry leading margins. With that being said, if we were to repeat our first half performance with respect to medical cost management in the second half, then it is highly likely we would outperform this full year earnings guidance. Turning now to an update on our long-term strategy for sustaining profitable growth. We remain confident that we will deliver on our long-term growth targets of 13% to 15% premium revenue growth and 15% to 18% adjusted earnings per share growth on average over time and sustained 4% to 5% pre-tax margins. Our recent performance is supportive of that outlook. Our model for organic growth remains sound. In Medicaid, our market share is high enough to be relevant to our state-based partners and gives us sufficient scale, but low enough to provide an environment for market share gains. Although it has been difficult to measure during the pandemic, we have grown market share in many of our states. The political landscape remains focused on reducing the uninsured population favoring government-sponsored programs and driving underlying growth in our current footprint. The economy has had a significant impact on the low-wage service sector as well. We continue to believe the post-pandemic Medicaid roles will be higher than pre-pandemic levels. On the RFP front, our past track record gives us confidence in successfully retaining the Medicaid contracts that are currently in a reprocurement process. Our RFP responses have been submitted in Mississippi, California and for Texas Star+ in our pending evaluation and subsequent award announcement. We are well positioned to retain these contracts due to our track record of operational and clinical excellence, standing and reputation, innovation and the demonstrated ability to write winning proposals. With multiple new RFP opportunities over the coming years, we remain confident in our ability to win additional new state contracts. We submitted our proposals in the states of Iowa and Nebraska and have many other new state business development initiatives well underway. In Medicare, the rate environment and demographic trends remain supportive of sustainable growth. Additionally, we have opportunities to further penetrate our Medicaid footprint in both D-SNP and low-income MAPD products. Our three distribution channels have achieved a high degree of productivity and have lowered our cost of acquisition. Consequently, we are investing heavily in these channels. In Marketplace, our focus is on keeping it small in the context of the overall portfolio and pricing with a goal of achieving mid single-digit pre-tax margins. As a result, we will grow this business only as allowed by this pricing strategy. Moving now to our inorganic growth strategy, our M&A platform continues to execute at a high level. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of My Choice Wisconsin’s MLTSS and core Medicaid assets for an attractive purchase price of approximately 15% of revenue. This acquisition is highly complementary to our expanding Wisconsin Medicaid footprint and our growing MLTSS business. My Choice Wisconsin serves over 44,000 members and generates premium revenue of approximately $1 billion. We expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to adjusted earnings and deliver first year adjusted EPS of $0.15 and $0.45 at full run-rate. In addition to being perfectly consistent with our product and geographic growth strategy, the acquisition of My Choice Wisconsin validates the vibrancy and actionability of our expansive M&A opportunity pipeline. With the addition of My Choice Wisconsin, our enterprise MLTSS business will be attached to over $9 billion in premium revenue and over $6 billion of LTSS benefits paid. Over the past 10 months, between AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin, we have announced nearly $2 billion in acquired revenue, which will be included in our 2023 premium revenue based on the expected timing of closing both transactions. We have now announced 7 acquisitions since we embarked on our growth strategy. The 5 already closed are achieving or exceeding their earnings accretion target. Given our track record and a pipeline replete with actionable and strategically focused acquisition opportunities, we are confident in our ability to continue to execute on this important dimension of our growth strategy. In summary, the company’s financial and operational performance validates our long-term revenue growth strategy and its value creation potential. Turning now to our initial outlook for 2023, while it is far too early to provide specific 2023 financial guidance, I will offer a view of some of the building blocks of our initial outlook for 2023. First, with respect to 2023 revenue, we continue to build the 2023 book of business throughout this year. At this early stage, we have line of sight to nearly 10% growth in 2023 from our strategic initiatives and an early estimate of organic growth. This growth will be partially offset by the impact of redeterminations, which we have spoken about at length and one or two potential pharmacy carve-outs, the timing and extent of which are uncertain. We are only halfway through 2022, and therefore, additional M&A announcements and new Medicaid procurement wins would add to the 2023 revenue picture. Now turning to 2023 earnings. First, in 2022, we are carrying approximately $3 per share of embedded earnings power, which we expect to be realized in 2023 and beyond. This estimate, which has been updated since last quarter, comprises net effect of COVID and full accretion on M&A earnings, offset by redetermination impacts. Second, we expect the core book of business will grow organically. As we have demonstrated in the past, when we grow organically, we achieve our target margins. Third, in the quarter, we have finalized or significantly progressed on some major initiatives, which provide earnings upside, two of which are noteworthy. We recently renegotiated and executed a new PBM contract with CVS Caremark, which extends the existing contract term at substantially more favorable pricing. Since pharmacy accounts for 15% to 20% of our medical cost baseline, the improved rate structure will substantially improve our pharmacy economics and resulting medical cost trend. The CVS Caremark relationship has been essential to our delivery of excellent pharmacy service to our customers and members and has enabled strong cost control. We are very pleased to have extended this relationship. And secondly, we intend to move permanently to a remote work environment, a model we have been working under successfully for nearly 2 years. As a result, by the end of this year, we expect to formalize a reduction of our real estate footprint by approximately two-thirds, yielding substantial and sustainable G&A savings. These building blocks aggregate to a very attractive earnings trajectory for 2023 and beyond, although the timing of emergence for each of these is still evolving. That being said, with 2022 adjusted earnings guidance of at least $17.60 per share, embedded earnings power of $3 per share, the earnings contribution of organic growth and the operational catalysts we just mentioned, we fully expect our 2023 adjusted earnings to be at least $20 per share. Although it is too early in the cycle to provide specific earnings guidance for 2023, we are very confident in this earnings outlook. We will certainly update this outlook as it evolves, informed by our performance in the second half of 2022 and the ongoing execution of our strategic initiatives. In conclusion, in the second quarter, we performed very well across the enterprise. Our 2022 earnings base [Technical Difficulty], our growth strategy is working and our early outlook for 2023 is strong. We are executing on our long-term strategic plan and delivering results accordingly. Of course, we could not do this without our excellent management team and dedicated associates, now approaching 15,000 strong. We have produced these results under the difficult and rapidly changing circumstances of the pandemic. To the entire team, I once again extend my deepest thanks and heartfelt appreciation. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark?
Mark Keim: Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss some additional details of our second quarter performance, our strong balance sheet, our updated guidance for 2022 and some initial views on the building blocks of our 2023 outlook. Beginning with our second quarter results. In Medicaid, our reported MCR was 88%. Normalizing for approximately $350 million of pass-through payments in our Texas plan, our reported MCR improves to 87.4%. This strong performance, better than the low end of our long-term target range, was driven by strong medical cost management and lower utilization. The net effect of COVID in the quarter was a modest 20 basis point increase to our reported MCR. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 86.9%, also better than the low end of our long-term target range. During the quarter, the net effect of COVID increased our reported MCR by 370 basis points as BA-5 and other variants resulted in increase in patient expense. This pressure was more than offset by favorable risk adjustment and strong medical cost management. In Marketplace, our reported second quarter MCR of 91.2% was inflated by a final true-up of 2021 risk adjustment transfer payments. Normalizing for this out-of-period item, our second quarter MCR was 85.7%. Recall, our Marketplace business was more than twice the size last year, so the prior year settlement had a disproportionate impact on the current year. Second quarter pure-period results were impacted by higher utilization due to the carryover effects of 2021 special enrollment period membership and approximately 50 basis points of net effect of COVID. We remain on track to return our Marketplace business to profitability on a pure-period basis in 2022. In aggregate, the net effect of COVID was consistent with our expectations and decreased net income by $0.68 per share in the quarter. The full year outlook for the net effect of COVID remains at $2.50 per share. Putting it all together, with the two adjustments I described, our reported second quarter MCR for the consolidated company of 88.1% improved to 87.2%. Similarly, our reported pretax margin of 4.4% increases to 5%. And the reported G&A ratio of 6.8% restates to 7%. We continue to expect our full year 2022 G&A ratio to be consistent with our long-term target, reflecting fixed cost leverage on our growth and ongoing discipline. Our results as reported and normalized, displayed the strong performance of our second quarter and the continuing earnings power of the business. Turning now to our balance sheet, our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and we remain confident in this reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter, normalized for pass-through payments, which inflate DCP, was 50.4% consistent with prior quarters. Our capital foundation remained strong. Debt at the end of the quarter was 1.9x trailing 12-month EBITDA, and our debt-to-cap ratio was 45.9%. On a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.7x and 43.7%, respectively. Our leverage remains low. All bond maturities are long-dated, on average 8 years, and our weighted average cost of debt is just 4%. We harvested $165 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, and we purchased approximately 660,000 of our shares for approximately $200 million. Parent company cash at the end of the quarter was $210 million. With substantial incremental debt capacity, cash on hand and strong free cash flow we have ample cash and capital to drive our organic and inorganic growth strategies. Now a few comments on our 2022 guidance. We have increased our full year premium revenue guidance by $750 million to approximately $30 billion, driven by two components: approximately $250 million, reflecting the latest extension of the public health emergency and the related delay in resuming a redetermination of Medicaid eligibility and approximately $500 million for the second quarter outperformance and some additional Texas pass-through revenue. We also raised our full year 2022 adjusted earnings guidance by $0.50 per share to at least $17.60. The increase is driven by three items: second quarter performance above our expectations by about $0.25 per share, margin on the additional revenue from the extension of the public health emergency, which we estimate at about $0.15 per share; an additional net income of $0.10 per share in the second half, driven by the recent rise in interest rates. Normalizing for the out-of-period risk adjustment item of $0.44 per share, our second quarter outperformance increases to about $0.70 per share. We have offset any extrapolation of this second quarter outperformance for the rest of the year with some tempered conservatism. Our first half MCRs outperformed the lower end of our long-term target ranges in both Medicaid and Medicare. In the second half, we are projecting those same ratios to be more in line with our long-term target ranges. As Joe mentioned, our updated guidance will prove conservative if the strong medical cost management and lower utilization we saw in the first half continues through the rest of the year. We expect second half earnings to be distributed fairly evenly between the third and fourth quarters. Finally, some additional color on the building blocks of our initial outlook for 2023. Beginning with premium revenue, our initial outlook is for the announced pending acquisitions of AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin and organic growth to drive approximately 10% growth of our current 2022 premium revenue guidance. We expect this growth to be partially offset by redeterminations and potential pharmacy carve-out. Our 2023 revenue outlook will continue to evolve as we make progress on our in-flight strategic initiatives, including acquisitions and procurement. Turning to adjusted earnings, first, our embedded earnings power is now approximately $3 per share, comprising $2.50 net effect of COVID, $1.50 from our closed and pending acquisitions went at target margin, offset by approximately $1 from the eventual impact of redeterminations. While it’s too early to guide on the emergence of these components, we offer some perspectives on what might impact 2023. Within the $2.50 net effect of COVID, corridors in just three states are the primary driver. We expect to see upside here as states terminate these corridors as Ohio already has and the lingering cost of COVID and patient services dissipates to a new normal. Our acquisitions typically reach target margin in the second year of operations. We feel confident we will see a significant portion of the $1.50 emerge in 2023 as Affinity and Cigna Texas will be in their second year and AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin will make their first-year contributions. We now assume redetermination will begin in October, and we expect to lose approximately half of the 750,000 members we gained since the start of the pandemic. These membership attrition assumptions yield a 2023 headwind of $1.2 billion in revenue and $0.70 per share on EPS. Several highly credible data points give us confidence that the margin on members lost through redetermination, have a similar profile to our overall membership. Second, the attractive growth of our legacy business and the associated margin, partially offset by potential pharmacy carve-outs will yield incremental earnings in 2023. Third, as Joe described, we see a combination of new operating drivers that should enhance our 2023 earnings growth, including our recently renegotiated PBM contract, which improves the economics on 15% to 20% of our total medical cost spend and our expected real estate reduction. We plan to reduce the roughly 2 million square feet of leased office space by approximately two-thirds by the end of the year. Finally, we expect higher interest rates to translate into correspondingly higher net investment income. These building blocks provide an early view of some of the most impactful components of our outlook for next year. Our evolving outlook on 2023 will be informed by our performance in the second half of 2022 as well as the ongoing execution of our strategic initiatives. We now feel confident in setting our initial outlook for 2023 adjusted EPS to at least $20. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Josh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just a question on the risk payable or risk transfer payable update, was that more your membership came in healthier than expected? You had codes rejected or something or was it the market was overall sicker? And how does that inform your pricing and thoughts around the opportunities for growth next year in the exchanges?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, Josh. Really, it was a function of the surge of special enrollment membership we experienced last year. If you recall, we took on 250,000 members between March and the end of the year. And of course, we had to really gear up and scale up to service that membership, including risk adjustment. So I think part of it was keeping pace with the surge of membership and getting the risk scores. I think part of it was the acuity of the membership. And I think another part of it was just the imprecise nature of actuarial estimations given that unstable environment. The good news for this year is we became aware of this emerging trend early in the quarter as we were developing our final pricing in the Marketplace, and we’re able to take the current view of the acuity of this population into consideration as we filed our final prices for 2023.
Josh Raskin: Okay, thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Matthew, perhaps your line is muted.
Matthew Borsch: Sorry. Can you hear me?
Joe Zubretsky: Yes, we can.
Matthew Borsch: Okay. I apologize, having a new phone here. So I was just going to ask about another item in the quarter, which is the prior year reserve development. Looked like you got a little over $100 million, I mean I’m not saying it’s a net benefit, obviously, because you’re replenishing reserves. But can you just comment on that because I think in the year ago period, it was pretty much zero?
Mark Keim: Yes, sure. Matt, good morning. It’s Mark. I think you’re looking at the year-over-year change. We had a little more prior year development this second quarter than we did a year ago at this time. And that’s not unusual. The way development happens is not always the same year-over-year. The way our providers submit claims and the way our internal operations, including payment integrity work is a little different year-over-year. So yes, the pattern is a little bit different. But what’s more important is I’m reporting our DCP at 50.4%, which versus a year ago at 48% is clearly up. The other thing that you guys look at a lot of times is just the growth in premium versus the growth in reserves. My reserves are up 28% year over my premiums are up 18%. So I feel really good about where I’m reserved. I think we’re in a good spot.
Matthew Borsch: Okay. Fantastic, thank you. 
Operator: The next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Stephen Baxter: Hi, thanks for the question. It was interesting here you talked about the several highly credible data points suggesting the decremental margin on the lost Medicaid redetermination membership would be in line with the portfolio average. Obviously, this is an area of concern or uncertainty for the market. So would love if you could maybe help us understand what you’re looking at to better understand this issue and reach that conclusion. Thank you.
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, Stephen. I’ll kick it to Mark for some of the actual numbers. But as a matter of routine in the Medicaid business, one needs to understand the duration of its membership. Duration could have an impact on the acuity of a population. So it’s something we routinely look at. I will tell you that during the pandemic, the duration of membership, the length of time people are on the Medicaid rolls didn’t extend all that much. And I will tell you that the differences in acuity as measured by medical care ratios is not that much different on short duration members versus long duration members. We have lots of other actuarial and medical economics data points that suggest that the members that will leave, will leave at portfolio averages. But I’ll turn it to Mark for a little more color on that.
Mark Keim: Sure. Just a couple of data points that we track really closely. Remember, within our Medicaid business, there is a TANF chip, there is expansion and there is ABD. So we look at these within each of those. One of the first things we look is the duration, what percentage of our members are with us for more than a year. In TANF chip, it really didn’t change meaningfully. ABD didn’t really change meaningfully. Expansion is up a little, not huge. Within those populations, though, we also then compare what’s the MCR for the folks that are maybe 2 years and longer with us versus the MCR for those less than a year. That’s the durational acuity concept that Joe mentioned. It’s really flat between those two cohorts in TANF chip. It’s pretty flat on ABD. It’s a really stable population. So it’s up a little in expansion. On the percentage of members with no claims, another one that’s good to look at. TANF chip pretty flat, ABD, once again flat. We’re seeing a little bit more in expansion. So could you argue that there is going to be a little bit of pressure within expansion? Possibly, but at third of the overall Medicaid book, any impact there gets diluted. So we really don’t see this as a big headwind.
Operator: The next question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Maybe just continuing to look – triangulate around the reverification question, so when you’re giving those numbers for next year, are you assuming the full impact of the reverification plays out next year? I know some of your peers have talked about states taking as much as 10 months to gear back up fully, and therefore, you would sort of have a partial impact next year and the full impact annualized in 2024. Can you – those numbers you threw out are that – is that the full impact, or is that a partial year and you expect more spillover into ‘24?
Joe Zubretsky: Two concepts, A.J., it’s Joe. First, we always forecast and plan according to the status quo and since the PHE, right at this point will end in October, that’s our planning assumption. We all expect it to be extended to the end of the year, but that’s a separate issue. As we build up our models on a state-by-state basis based on conversations with the state and how they plan to execute the redetermination process, so the buildup of what we do is very much bottoms up. We do, in our forecast. Most of the impact is 2023, some of it spills over into 2024. The key numbers are $3.2 billion of Medicaid revenue gained as the 750,000 membership growth occurred. It will ultimately settle at $1.6 billion and that will roll out mostly in 2023 at $1.2 billion or $400 million spilling over into 2024. Mark, any color to add?
Mark Keim: Yes. A.J., I would just always remind people to do the member month math because it gets complicated, right. If the PHE ends in October, the stipulation is that states have a year from the end of PHE to be done. So, they have got to be done next October. But if you look at the member months, it’s as Joe mentioned, I have got $1.2 billion of headwind in for ‘23 and another $400 million in for 2024.
A.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks so much.
Operator: The next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Nathan Rich: Hi. Good morning. If I could ask a two-part question on the 2023 guidance that you gave. For the 10% growth in premium revenue, and obviously, that excludes redeterminations, if you back out the impact of acquisitions, it looks like low-single digit revenue growth. Could you maybe just talk about how that breaks down by line of business? And then you mentioned having industry-leading margins in – I think doing the quick math on the premium revenue outlook and earnings it looked like you were kind of continuing to be at the top end of that range. So, could you maybe just talk about margin potential from here as we think about the next several years?
Joe Zubretsky: First on the growth assumptions, we have included a modest, but early view of our organic growth trajectory for next year. If you look back at our Investor Day models, in Medicaid, we say that just by being in Medicaid with premium yield and additions to the Medicaid roles, we are expecting 4% growth. In Medicare, that same phenomenon, yield and growth in the Medicare population, both on agents and penetrations of managed care, will add about 7%. So, when we talk about organic growth, we are talking about merely yield and the growth in the market. And if you weight that at 80% and 13% of revenue, you are talking about perhaps 5% growth just by being in those markets. Then of course, we have our strategic initiatives, which are only halfway done. We are only halfway through 2022. So, we have far more to do on building the book of business for next year. So, we are really happy that at this early stage between our strategic initiatives and an early view of organic growth, we are already accounting for 10% over the 2022 baseline. Your second question again?
Nathan Rich: Yes, sorry, just on the margin opportunity, given that the business is kind of operating today at the high end of the long-term target.
Joe Zubretsky: Well, one of the reasons why we settled in at $17.60 for our guidance is – let’s frame where we are. We just printed [indiscernible], revenues growing at 18%, earnings per share growing at 34% on both a six-month and a three-month basis, our pretax margins are 5% and after-tax margins are at 3.7%, and we did that by outperforming the ranges of our MCRs, which produce best-in-class industry margins. So, to continue to forecast that level of outperformance going forward, we thought was a bit imprudent and perhaps too aggressive. So, we were purposely conservative to merely forecast the rest of the year as operating within our long-term target MCR ranges. We are going to end the year at 4.5% pretax margin, 3.3% after-tax and MCRs squarely in those long-term targets, which again produce best-in-class industry margins. We are always looking for ways to improve the performance of the business. We mentioned two very significant operational catalysts going forward, the renegotiation of our pharmacy contract and the fact that we are moving to a permanent remote work strategy. So, we are constantly working the system to try to find ways to attain fixed cost leverage, drive down our G&A ratios and perform at the top end of our long-term ranges for the MCR.
Nathan Rich: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Kevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. I guess one quick clarification and then from the actual question. When you said 10% revenue growth for next year, then you said partially offset by redeterminations. Was that 10% number including those, or are you saying it was 10%, kind of giving us a sense of how you normally grow, but then net, it will be a little bit less than 10% because of those other items?
Mark Keim: Hey. Good morning. It’s Mark. The 10% is the announced, but not closed acquisitions of AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin as well as that organic growth concept that Joe described, the 4% in Medicaid, more like the 7% in Medicare. The other items then are adjustments, but they are a little vague at the moment. We are still working through those.
Kevin Fischbeck: Okay. So, it’s 10 minus something. That’s how to think about it right now. Okay. And then, I guess as you think about the COVID impact. I guess I am struggling a little bit with how you talk about the cohort impact because it seems like it’s a little bit different than how some of your peers are talking about the COVID impact because, like with Q2, you seem to be saying that COVID was a headwind, but that you were able to offset it with medical management. Where most of the companies seem to kind of be saying, for whatever reason, volume didn’t come back the way that it normally does in Q2 and they are being cautious in the back half of the year. You are still being cautious in the back half of the year. But just tying to understand exactly what you think happened in the quarter. Was it an industry-wide phenomenon, or do you kind of view like your controlling trend below and it’s kind of more outperformance or trying to be more sustainable versus maybe a blip in how people use utilization during COVID troughs and peaks and therefore, maybe a little bit less clear about what happens in the back half? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, Kevin. We are pretty disciplined in how we measure the COVID impacts, both the direct cost of COVID-related care and the offsetting curtailment. It’s been uncanny that as COVID infection rates spike, and therefore, the direct cost of COVID care increase, the offset of utilization curtailment has pretty much offset the direct cost of COVID-related care. Now, you are never sure whether that’s going to continue to be that highly correlated. But as I look back over every quarter that – during the pandemic, that has basically been the case. So, for the most part, our COVID cost is about two-thirds the corridors, the three remaining corridors, and one-third the net effect of COVID direct offset by curtailment.
Mark Keim: Yes. Just to build on that, our definition of the net effect of COVID has been consistent across the 2.5 years here of the pandemic. As Joe mentioned, it’s about two-thirds corridors and then the rest is COVID inpatient direct, which we can measure and then the offsetting curtailment of certain services where we are just not seeing that. We are seeing that relationship be very consistent. We laid out the different impacts line of business by line of business. You saw our Medicaid and marketplace businesses had a relatively light impact. Medicare was a little higher at 370 bps. That’s been typically tracking more around 200 bps. So, that one is just a little bit higher. Line of business to line of business, it bounces around. But across the portfolio, it’s pretty much tracking where we would expect. We are still at that $2.50 for the full year.
Joe Zubretsky: I was going to say the final proof point is our effective medical cost management actually contain utilization in areas that were unaffected by the COVID infection rate, which would suggest that our utilization routines, our payment integrity routines, all the things we do to effectively medically manage a population are working in areas that were unaffected by COVID. So, we are operating well and managing medical costs very, very well in areas unaffected by COVID.
Kevin Fischbeck: I guess the thing I don’t understand about the corridor comment because if you are at or above your target margin in Medicaid, but you are saying that when corridors go away, then that we should think about you permanently being able to operate above the Medicaid business? Because it seems like you are already at your peak margin in Medicaid. So, if corridors go away, then you would be – and that’s the base to be thinking about going forward, that you are going to be permanently above that. So, I just – I am just talking a little bit with kind of how to think about corridors being the net COVID.
Joe Zubretsky: We understand the math behind that. The simple math is if you take our embedded earnings and just convert it to actual earnings, it would suggest that the margins pop slightly north on a pretax basis of the top end of our range. But two things, one, embedded earnings is in guidance, and two, it doesn’t all emerge at one time or within 1 year. Now, with respect to the corridors, there is only three that matter that remain, and one of them has already been eliminated for October. The two that remain are Mississippi and Washington. And if they persist beyond the pandemic, then they are part of the earnings baseline, and we will live with them for a longer period of time. But there is –we are pretty optimistic that they will fall away over time.
Mark Keim: And Kevin, just to put a point on that, that means that 15 of our 18 Medicaid states are not constrained by corridors. And that’s part of where our margin story is.
Kevin Fischbeck: Alright. Great. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Hall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Michael Hall: Hey. Thanks guys. So, just real quick first on the risk corridor. So, 15 out of 18 that aren’t constrained. But – so you don’t have any long-standing risk corridors that are pre-COVID in any of those other 15 states?
Mark Keim: We do. That last conversation was specifically around the net effect of COVID and COVID-related corridors. Pre-pandemic, a number of states had different mechanisms that did constrain some profitability, but that’s more our legacy profile. So, we are talking here specifically about COVID era corridors.
Michael Hall: Got it. But presumably, you are in a net payable position in the other 15 states in some of them, right?
Mark Keim: To a small degree, yes, and that changes year-to-year.
Michael Hall: Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then my real question. So, it looks like you guys are now expecting low-single digit margins this year for exchange. But heading into the quarter, and I guess even this year, the shift of silver focused pricing efforts, there are seemingly a lot of confidence in improving to mid-single digits. But MLR this quarter, even without the risk adjustment payable, is still much higher than the Street at 85%. And now year-to-date, you guys are tracking the mid-80s, just curious what happened there? You mentioned higher core utilization. What are the dynamics you are seeing and or there is just some mispricing related to that.
Joe Zubretsky: Well, I mean in summary, we are 200 basis points to 300 basis points off on 7% of our revenue, so putting it in perspective, which we are not happy about. We want to operate in the low-80s. The business breaks even at 85 and we are projecting to do 84 or better for the year, which would be modest profitability. First and foremost, we repositioned the book of business. That was the tall order for 2022, keep it small 7% of revenue. Keep it silver, 75% of our membership is now silver membership. Keep it stable, two-thirds of our membership is now renewal membership when that was completely as the opposite in prior years. So, we have the book of business positioned very, very well. Now, we will work on the 200 basis points to 300 basis points of pressure that is pressuring our MCR. And with the pricing we put in for 2023, on average, 13% to 14% in some states higher, we feel good about getting to those mid-single digit target margins.
Michael Hall: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
George Hill: Yes. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I was just going to ask you about the new contract with CVS. I don’t know if there is any chance that you can kind of quantify savings opportunity looks like or if there is any meaningful change in the scope or the services that are being provided or…?
Joe Zubretsky: No change in the scope of services. We have a very good balance between what we operate and what they operate, no change in that. The agreement was extended through 2026. We are not going to talk about the pricing of it. We obviously wouldn’t have mentioned it if it wasn’t an earnings catalyst. But 15% to 20% of our medical cost is pharmacy-related. And the pricing decrement we received was, in our view, noteworthy to discuss as an earnings catalyst for 2023 and beyond. But at this point, we are not going to actually size the pricing.
George Hill: Okay. So, maybe sizing the pricing isn’t the right way to think about it. But is the – if we use that range, is there a way to think about how we should think about like what the change to MLR can be as it flows through the income statement, or I guess just kind of any way to kind of quantify the earnings contribution you guys not necessarily the pricing on the contract?
Joe Zubretsky: Well as I said, at this point in time, we have sized the size of the contract, $4 billion to $5 billion a year of pharmacy spend. But no, we are not yet prepared. When we give 2023 guidance, the CVS Caremark contract would likely be a meaningful contributor to that guidance, and we will potentially talk about it specifically then.
George Hill: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The last question today comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Steven Valiquette: Hey. Thanks. Good morning guys. I was also going to ask about the exchange business, but a lot of that was covered. I guess the follow-up question around that, though, Joe, when you kind of mentioned those 13% to 14% premium increases that you put in place, how does that stack up relative to your medical cost trend expectation for exchange book for next year? And something that you are mainly focused on margins, but I guess do you expect profit growth within that book the way it stands right now for ‘23? I just want to confirm that. Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Yes. Our strategy for the marketplace business is to target mid-single digit pretax margins and let the revenue float up and down accordingly pursuant to that pricing strategy. Based on the early read, where we actually now have seen competitive pricing, the price increases we put in, in a handful of markets remained very competitive. If we are number one or number two or a close number three or four in the market, we have maintained that position. So, the early read only in a handful of markets is that not only do we believe our pricing has appropriately captured trend, but we maintained our competitive position. So, the book of business shouldn’t materially change.
Mark Keim: The only thing I would add to that is now that we understand current year performance, the base period that we are jumping off we feel much better about. So, we are pricing in a trend that we feel good about going into 2023. Joe mentioned the 13% average rate that we are putting into the market. The only other thing that maybe isn’t obvious as you build your model is that the assumption in there on risk adjustment, right. Those are the three big drivers trend, the changes in risk adjustment for the underlying acuity of the population, and of course, price. You put those things together, and we feel very well positioned for the return to that mid-single digit pretax next year.
Steven Valiquette: Got it. Okay. Alright. Thanks.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. This concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-28 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Molina Healthcare First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And I'd now like to turn the conference over to Joe Krocheski, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Joe Krocheski: Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare's first quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim.  A press release announcing the first quarter earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be made available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made are as of today, Thursday, April 28, 2022, and will not be updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our first quarter 2021 press release. During our call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding current 2022 guidance, our growth strategy and expected growth, our RFPs positions, the COVID-19 pandemic, our acquisitions, our future margins and embedded earnings power and our long-term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the Risk Factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report for the 2020 year filed with the SEC as well as the Risk Factors listed in our Form 10-Q and our Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?
Joe Zubretsky: Thank you, Joe. And good morning. Today, we will provide you with updates on several topics: our financial results for the first quarter 2022; our full year 2022 guidance in the context of our first quarter results and our growth initiatives and the reaffirmation of our strategy for sustaining profitable growth.  Let me start with the first quarter highlights. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of $4.90 with adjusted net income of $288 million. First quarter premium revenue grew 19% year-over-year to $7.5 billion, driven by strong membership gains in Medicaid and Medicare. Our 87.1% consolidated MCR in the first quarter is squarely in line with our long-term target range and demonstrates strong operating performance even as we continue to navigate pandemic-related challenges. In the quarter, the net effective COVID increased our consolidated MCR by approximately 50 basis points, decreasing net per diluted share by approximately $0.57. Within the net effect of COVID inpatient COVID costs in the quarter were the highest since the beginning of the pandemic, surging in the month of January and then steadily subsiding throughout the quarter. These costs were mostly off by COVID related utilization, curtailment and effective medical cost management. Despite the continued pandemic-related impact, we produced an adjusted after-tax margin of 3.7%, a very strong result that is at the high end of our long-term target range and consistent with normal seasonal patterns. Turning now to highlights by line of business. In Medicaid, we ended the quarter with approximately 4.6 million members an increase of approximately 700,000 or 18% year-over-year. This strong performance drove 24% Medicaid premium revenue growth year over year. Increased membership was the balanced result of our recent acquisitions and organic gains supported by the redetermination pause. In the first quarter, we continued to generate excellent margins in our Medicaid business with a medical care ratio at 88.1%, which is in line with our long-term target. The enduring highlights of our flagship Medicaid business are as follows. Our diversified portfolio of 18 state contracts provides for excellent distribution of risk related to rate setting and contract reprocurements, actuarially sound rates prevail, and the rate setting process establishes a credible medical cost baseline with forward trend and benefit changes. Poor medical cost trends remain stable and well controlled. The few remaining COVID risk-sharing corridors continue to capture some of our outperformance, but we expect these to be eliminated over time. And we continue to execute our growth strategy. Our in-state market shares are large enough to be relevant to our state customers, yet small enough to support significant growth opportunity. In Medicare, we ended the quarter with 148,000 members or 17% growth year-over-year, with related premium revenue growth of 18%. Our performance was driven primarily by organic gains and our D-SNP and MAPD products as we continue to increase our market share and our existing footprint and expand geographically to match our Medicaid footprint. Our reported Medicare MCR was very strong on the quarter at 86.5%, which is below the low end of our long-term target range, even after absorbing 190 basis points of COVID-related pressure. In marketplace we ended the quarter with 371,000 members. This result is higher than previously projected, driven by higher-than-expected effectuation rates during the later stages of open enrollment. The declines in membership and premium from prior year are consistent with our previously communicated strategy to reposition the book of business and its risk profile. Our marketplace business is now more appropriately sized in the overall portfolio. Our first quarter marketplace MCR was 78.6%. This result is in line with our long-term target, even after absorbing 270 basis points of COVID-related pressure and reflects the successful implementation of our strategy to restore this business to target margins. As Mark will discuss in a moment, the favorable mix of renewal membership and the silver-tier products, gives us great confidence that we will achieve our 2022 margin goal. In summary 2022 is off to a very strong start. Medicaid, our flagship business, representing 80% of revenue, continues to produce strong, predictable operating results, and cash flow.  Our high acuity Medicare niche serving low-income members continues to grow organically and exceeded our long-term target margins. In marketplace a complimentary product in our government subsidized strategy is now well-positioned for success at 7% of total company premium revenue. Turning now to our 2022 guidance, beginning with premium revenue. We now project premium revenue to be approximately $29.25 billion or approximately $750 million above our previous guidance. Our revenue growth rates are consistent with our long-term targets. Specifically, our updated premium revenue guidance now includes approximately $400 million of additional Medicaid revenue resulting from the extension of the public health emergency from April to July and the associated suspension of membership redeterminations. Approximately $100 million of marketplace revenue resulting from stronger open enrollment as we now expect to end 2022 with approximately 270,000 members. And approximately $250 million related to state-based passthrough revenue payments. As in the past, we have excluded from our premium revenue guidance, any impact of the AgeWell acquisition, which we expect to close in the third quarter of this year. Turning now to earnings guidance: We are increasing our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance to know less than $17.10. Specifically our increased 2022 earnings guidance reflects the favorable impacts of strong first quarter performance, underlying strength in the business in the rest of the year, the margin associated with the increase in our premium revenue, the combination of which is largely offset by a $0.50 per share increase in projected net effect of COVID. We have remained cautious in forecasting utilization trends in the remaining nine months of the year. Due to the uncertainties of COVID, and related utilization curtailment as well as core medical cost trend we believe at the end of the second quarter our membership will have seasoned enough to allow us to fine tune our forecast of COVID related medical cost and core medical cost trend. We are confident in our 2022 outlook that features revenue growth rates consistent with our long-term targets, and after tax margin at the midpoint of our long-term guidance range and strong earnings per share growth of 26%. Turning now to an update on our strategy for sustaining profitable growth. Building on our momentum from last year, we are off to a strong start in 2022. Based on our past track record, we are confident in successfully retaining the Medicaid contract that are currently in a procurement process. Our RFP responses have been submitted in Mississippi and California and are pending evaluation and subsequent award announcement. The Texas STAR+PLUS RFP has been issued by the state and our response is currently being developed. We have a high degree of confidence in retaining these contracts as a result of our operational and clinical excellence, standing and reputation, innovation and the demonstrated ability to write winning proposals. At the beginning of the year we successfully launched our Medicaid plan in Nevada, adding a new state to our footprint and 125,000 members. With multiple RFP opportunities over the coming years, we remain confident in our ability to win additional new state contracts. We have one new state proposal pending in Rhode Island and many other new state business development opportunities well in process. Our M&A platform continues to execute at a high level. On January 1st, we closed on the acquisition of Cigna's Texas Medicaid business, deepening our service offerings in the state and adding 44,000 high acuity members. Our acquired businesses are achieving or exceeding their earnings accretion targets. The pipeline of acquisition opportunities remains robust. We are confident in our ability to drive continued value from this important dimension of our growth strategy. The company's performance continues to validate our long-term strategy and its value creation and potential. We can and will grow the top line at 13% to 15% per year on average over time by a combination of market share gains, new contract wins, footprint expansion and of course bolt-on M&A. We can achieve this growth and maintain pre-tax margins in the range of 4Tto 5%. Rates are stable and our effectiveness at medical cost management while ensuring optimum quality has been consistently demonstrated. A number of external factors are combining to support government sponsored healthcare. In particular demographics, economic disruptions and political priorities are working together to generate meaningful tailwinds for the industry. And finally, our strong cash flow generation gives us ample capacity to invest in new capabilities and acquisitions. Our strategy is sound validated with each quarter's performance and will continue to be valued creating. As I conclude my remarks, I want to express my continued gratitude to our management team and to our nearly 14,000 Molina colleagues, their skill, dedication and steadfast service form the foundation for everything we have achieved and everything we will achieve in the years to come. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Keim for some additional color on the financials. Mark?
Mark Keim: Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss some additional details of our first quarter performance. I will then turn to the balance sheet and some thoughts on our 2022 guidance. Beginning with some detailed commentary of out our first quarter results, the total company net effective COVID reduced net income by $0.57 per share and added 50 basis points to the consolidated MCR. This result was largely consistent with our expectations. However, the impact varied by lines of business with minimal impact on Medicaid and larger impacts on marketplace and Medicare. In Medicaid our reported MCR was 88.1%, a strong result that was in-line with our long-term target. For the quarter the net effective COVID was a modest 10 basis point increase to our reported MCR as the high volume of inpatient stays and COVID related corridors we're largely offset by curtailment of utilization. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 86.5% better than our long-term target. During the quarter, the net effect of COVID increased our reported MCR by 190 basis points. This pressure was more than offset by favorable risk adjustment and product mix. In marketplace our reported MCR was 78.6%, this result was in line with our long-term target despite absorbing 270 basis points of net effect of COVID. Our reported MCR was also influenced by our strategy of focusing on silver products, which experienced less MCR seasonality than bronze products due to lower deductibles. Silver members, as a percent of our book increased from approximately 50% in the first quarter of 2021 to 75% in the first quarter of 2022. Additionally renewal members now comprised two-thirds of our membership, up from one-third last year. These factors combined with a more limited SEP in 2022 give us continued confidence in restoring margins to our mid-single digit target in 2022. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 7.1%, reflecting increased temporary of labor costs due to industry-wide hiring challenges and some one-time items. We expect our full year 2022 G&A ratio to be consistent with our long-term target. Turning now to our balance sheet: Our capital foundation remained strong. We harvested $115 million of some bestiary dividends in the quarter and our quarter-end parent company cash balance was $250 million. Debt at the end of the quarter was 2.1 times trailing 12-month EBITDA. Our debt-to-cap ratio is 46.3%. However, on a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.8 times and 43.5% respectively. These metrics reflect a conservative leverage position and ample cash capacity for additional growth and investment. Turning to reserves: Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and we continue to be confident in our reserve position. Days and claims payable at the end of the quarter was flat sequentially at 51 days of medical cost expense. Finally, a few comments on guidance. We have increased our 2022 adjusted earnings guidance to no less than $17.10 per share. We continue to project slightly more than half of the year's earnings in the first two quarters. In addition, we have increased our view of embedded earnings by $0.25 to $2.75 per share. The increase is driven by the higher net effect of COVID we are now expecting this year, partly offset by moderately higher impact from redetermination that we expect next year stemming from the extension of the public health emergency. As a reminder, this embedded earnings power does not represent 2023 guidance, but rather an accounting of drivers that are temporarily suppressing our earnings profile, and our current projection of the impact of Medicaid redeterminations post 2022. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ben Rossi: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question here. Ben Rossi filling in for Matt. I just wanted to ask about the exchange. So as a follow-up to the expected revenue number attrition for marketplace, which decreased about 30% for premiums and about half membership enrollment from year-end last year, can you help us think about how trends and marketplace margins were impacted by the diverse selection dynamic this past quarter compared to where margins sit at the end of the year? Because you previously mentioned last call about a possible 7 to 8 point increase during the quarter. I'm just curious on how that progress is coming along. And where do you think the rate of about 1.5% to 2% monthly attrition is still representative for the group?
Joe Zubretsky: Hi Ben, this is Joe. The marketplace business is now perfectly positioned to achieve our mid-single digit pre-tax margin target for the year. I will tell you it's very difficult to make comparisons year-over-year given the substantial mix shift that we orchestrated from 2021 to 2022. So some data points are 78.6% MCR in the quarter was burdened by 270 basis points of COVID – so on our ex-COVID basis is closer to 76 that will light grow for seasonality during the year modestly. And we believe we'll achieve in the middle of our long-term target range at 79% for the full year. We're confident in that, as Marc said in the prepared remarks because of the mix of renewal membership versus new membership, which is now two-third renewal, one-third new. The mix of silver versus bronze, which is now 75/15 and last year it was 55/45 and the fact that the SEP period last year took all comers. There were no income cutoffs and this year we believe the eligible population for SEP has been basically reduced by half due to the limitation on income to 150% of FPL. So year-over-year comparisons are very, very difficult given the dramatic orchestrated shift in the book. The business is now very, very well positioned to achieve our mid annual digit pretax margin for the full year.
Ben Rossi: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Kevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. I just wanted to clarify the comment about how MLR has performed versus your long-term target in Q1. Is that basically a comment that you'd expect the years MLR to come in as expected because some businesses, I guess, particularly the exchanges have that seasonality where you'd expect Q1 to always be the lowest in the quarter, and therefore almost always be below your target MLR for the year? Or are you saying it's below your target MLR for Q1? Just trying to understand if you're telling us that this will persist to the rest of the year or just whether Q1 was a good quarter?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure. Kevin, it's Joe, and then I'll kick it to Mark. Yes, there is some modest seasonality to the business. In fact, I would say that the seasonality and marketplace is much more dampen than it has in the past due to the higher silver mix that we have one data two. The answer to your question is both, we're hitting our long-term targets both on the quarter and we expect to hit them for the full year, although there's 70 to 90 basis points of seasonality from the front end of the year to the back end of the year. Mark?
Mark Keim: Yes, that's exactly right, Joe. The answer is both within the quarter all three lines of business were in – within the long-term guidance. In fact, Medicare was better and they're all tracking to be squarely in the middle of long-term guidance on a full year basis and of course that's reflected in our full year guidance Operator?
Operator: The next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Steven Valiquette: Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody. So yes, just regarding the COVID impact on MLR across all your books of business in the first quarter, it was obviously pretty low on Medicaid, but then much higher on Medicare and marketplace. I guess I'm curious which one of the three COVID impact trends really surprised you the most in the first quarter? And also as we think about that the extra $0.50 of EPS headwind in the guidance for 2022 from COVID, is there any bias for that to be skewed towards any of the specific books of business? Or is that just too hard to predict right now? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Hi, Steven, it's Joe, and then I'll kick it to Mark for some additional color. The net effect of COVID was slightly higher than our expectations in the quarter. I remind everyone that we calculate or estimate the net effect of COVID as being the direct inpatient cost of COVID related care offset by an estimate of what we believe to be utilization curtailment due to the pandemic. And furthermore the effect of our outperformance in the states that continued to carry the COVID related corridors forward. That's how we calculate the impact. For the most part in the recent past we've seen the direct cost of COVID related care, which were very significant in the quarter. It surged in January and was significantly reduced in both February and March, pretty much offset by curtailment, not totally but pretty much. And then of course our outperformance, which we continue to enjoy in the states that have carried for the corridors, continues to be captured by the corridors. So it was a little higher than expected and the reason we increased our estimate for the full year is you're never completely comfortable that curtailment will always be a direct offset to COVID related care. And to the extent it doesn't, we wanted to be conservative with our outlook for the year.
Mark Keim: Yes. And just to build on Joe's comments, clearly in Q1 we saw higher net effective COVID as a percentage or in the MCR in Medicare and marketplace. As Joe mentioned the increase of $0.50 across the rest of the year really about some certainties and some conservativism about the outlook for the cost of COVID in-patient in the related curtailment. Where that might manifest? We've typically seen a little more in Medicare and marketplace, but it can move around among the lines of business but I think that's a pretty good overview of our outlook.
Steven Valiquette: Okay. That's great. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Justin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on your comments around the $2.75 of kind of pent-up earnings. And as I look at your – as I look at your run rates from an EPS perspective, it looks like your margins are towards the or pinned to the higher end of your old target rates across the book. One is that right or do you feel like you've still got some room to the high end? And if so, if you are at the higher end, do you feel like you have upside to those margin targets? Do you feel like there's further room in terms of earnings power or should we look at that $2.75 as being more cushion again something that could happen, like state rates, get a little tougher or what have you?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure. Justin, its Joe, and then I'll turn to Mark for some color. But we are operating in the first quarter given the seasonality of the business, at the high end of our margin range we produced an after tax margin of 3.7% on a pretax margin of 4.9%. For the year, as I just suggested with the MCR seasonality commentary that that will moderate to where we estimate in our full year guidance of pretax margin of approximately 4.4% and 3.3% after tax in the middle of the range. So yes, if you then take embedded earnings purely without any other puts and takes for future forecasting and guidance; it would bring you higher in the range, which is entirely possible. But as you suggest our embedded earnings guidance is not a forecast. Our embedded earnings estimate is not a forecast and is not guidance. And yes, it could move us the top end of the range or act as a buffer against other things that we need to forecast in the future.
Mark Keim: That's right, Justin. So as Joe mentioned, guidance is smack in the middle of the range, 3.3% is in the middle of the range of 3% to 3.7%, so next year that's $2.75 is certainly upside. The flip side as we grow our business, we stack on M&A, we add new procurements. Those tend to come in a little lower in margin in the early years, and you've always got the impact of organic. So what we always say is it's certainly not guidance. It's just an accounting of some of the things that are depressing earnings this year. There'll be other things to add in next year, but it's certainly a good tailwind into 2023.
Justin Lake: All right. Thanks for the color.
Operator: The next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Nathan Rich: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more on what drove the higher COVID headwind estimate that's now incorporated in guidance. And it seems like it may you related to just a more conservative forecasting on non-COVID utilization trends. I was just wondering if you could kind of go into more detail on what you've seen in March, as COVID cases have died down and how we should think about kind of the 2Q and the go-forward there? Thank you.
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, Nathan. The first thing I would say is when I say it subsided during the quarter, it did so dramatically. Our COVID direct cost of care in January were the highest since the beginning of the pandemic. In February those costs were cut to one-third of the January actual and in March cut yet another one-third in March off of February, a dramatic decline. But the BAQ was out there and while the infection rate is high, the severity and the treatment protocols are actually quite light. However, we never know whether it's going to resurge and we wanted to be as you suggested cautious with our outlook for COVID, particularly because in the recent past utilization curtailment has nearly offset the entire direct cost of cover related care. We never have full assurance that that will continue. Our second point, on what we call core medical cost trend, just the routine of cranking up our medical economics engine and truly understanding all the different dimensions of medical costs. We saw nothing in the quarter that surprised us or was unusual. All the things that you've read about and are being reported on where orthopedic procedures coming back with joint replacements, the ambulatory and outpatient settings are back in business, and we're seeing an uptick, but nothing unusual. We see spikes in pharmacy costs here and there; as some of our state single preferred drug lists sometimes promote the use of branded drugs. So nothing unusual and nothing surprising. It's the normal many inflection points here and there, but we wanted to remain cautious. We are hopefully on the tail end of the pandemic and we usually are cautious in our medical cost forecasting and want to see Q2 results before we put a better fine tune estimate on it.
Nathan Rich: Thanks very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Hall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Michael Hall: Hey, thank you guys. Just want to dive a little deeper on redeterminations. So with the resumption of redetermination being pushed out further and further into the year just in terms of timing in cadence of recapturing those lives into your exchange book, as those lives drop off, would you anticipate more of a, I guess like an immediate turnaround on recapturing them or is it more reasonable to assume the [indiscernible] might take couple or a few months to sign up? And on the net impact on those labs, on one hand I know you price for sizeable margin improvement on those new lives, so they should becoming more profitable, but as these lives come onto your book later in the year, it becomes more difficult to properly risk score them. So just want to get your thoughts on that?
Joe Zubretsky: Well Michael, we always characterize the redetermination phenomenon as when it's going to happen is really just a mathematical exercise of when the membership trips and revenue follows, which fiscal years is it going to hit. And right now it's – we're going to enjoy that membership and revenue for a longer period of time in 2022, and more of it will fall off in 2023. I think we think the real key point is how much of it persists beyond the redetermination period. And our forecast is that we grew 750,000 even slightly higher than that of organic growth in Medicaid since the beginning of the pandemic, we forecast to retain half of it. We believe the revenue growth associated with that was $2.9 billion, and we'll continue to have $1.6 billion of that when the re-determined processes complete. We also respect because CMS is now given clear guidance and is concerned with people being orphaned without healthcare, that they've made it a lot easier for us to work with our state customers to warm transfer members off of Medicaid if they're no longer eligible into marketplace and or Medicare, and these are products we continually enjoy. So that's sort of the strategy we have operational protocols in place to handle all this. We are concerned with the individual state's ability to handle a tremendous amount of value, 80 million people going through redetermination and re-eligibility inside of one-year is a huge undertaking. But we are really confident in the forecast that we've given on how much membership we will retain and potentially warm transfer into marketplace. Mark anything on the year-over-year comparison?
Mark Keim: Joe, I think you hit the key points there. The only thing Michael that you also asked about is just the timing of them coming over from redetermination to marketplace, that'll vary. In certain places we have really good operations to proactively reach out to people, help them with their redetermination and to the extent they lose Medicaid eligibility, immediately get them signed up in marketplace. In other cases, members may fall off and after a month or two come back on. So I think state-by-state as the rules slightly vary exactly how those transitions work will vary as well, but I think you've hit the big points.
Operator: The next question comes from A. J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
A. J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Just maybe to continue on discussion about the marketplace is obviously the enhanced subsidies under the ACA are potential to go away at the end of the year if Congress doesn't act. Do you have a sense of how much of your marketplace membership today might be impacted by that? How is that if the possibility that might go away, how is that impacting your thinking about exchanges, recapture, re-verification, and so forth next year? Is there any contingency either in your bid approach or otherwise that you can put in place, and you're thinking about?
Joe Zubretsky: AJ it's Joe. Just at a very, very high level we believe that the impact to Molina's marketplace business will more or less reflect what happens nationally. So, if there's 14 plus million members in marketplace today across the industry, estimates have the enhanced subsidies causing an attrition of slightly more than, but just about three million members back down to 11. I also would remind you that there is this family glitch fix that will move the other way. Estimates say that there's five million families in the United States that might at least be eligible. Our view is probably only 20% of that will actually come back into the product. So, fourteen minus three, plus one, maybe it's a $12 million membership portfolio nationally. And we believe our – we have no reason to believe that our membership will react any differently than that. Look, it's an important product in the portfolio because we consider it to be an adjunct of Medicaid, not only operationally, but strategically. And I think when these members redetermined this year, it's going to be the proof point that if we can warm transfer them into a marketplace product and enjoy their membership for another year or two, then it's position in the portfolio is validated. We like it at 7% of revenue at $2 billion. Maybe that flex is up and down here with these two, industry phenomenon you described. But our goal is to maintain this business at mid-single digit margins. And we will let the revenue flex up and down with the goal of hitting mid-single digit pretax margins.
A. J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Scott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Wanted to stick on the market a place and get your guys’ perspectives just on the sort of broader under [indiscernible].
Joe Krocheski: I'm sorry. We have experienced a technical difficulty here. If you were in a question queue, could you please re-queue? I will unmute Scott Fidel’s line in just a moment, Scott Fidel you are unmuted now.
Scott Fidel: Okay. Thanks. We'll I guess we'll try it again. Hey, good morning. Just wanted to ask about your thoughts on the underwriting cycle in the exchange market that we've seen in the last couple years had considerably more capacity coming into the market, some of that pretty irrational in terms of some of the pricing strategies. And just trying to think about sort of where we're sitting in that dynamic heading into 2023, we've seen one of the most aggressive players in the market already talk about pulling back from a number of their state footprints and clearly losses for several of these [indiscernible] have gotten pretty extreme right over the last year or two. So just interested in how you guys are thinking about the competitive dynamic for the exchange market for 2023. And maybe how that presents itself around some of your strategy around pricing and growth for next year?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure Scott, and then I'll kick it to Mark for color. But as [indiscernible] repeating the strategy is this is an adjunct to Medicaid. It leverages the Medicaid network. And it's a residual market for people that are no longer eligible for Medicaid, but still need subsidies to afford healthcare. We follow our Medicaid foot. So, the strategy is very, very well understood here at the company. And the financial profile again, bears repeating. We will allow revenue to flex up and down, whether it's trend related, whether it's new CMS rules related or whether it's competitive forces, we will let revenue flex up and down with the goal of maintaining this business at mid-single-digit margins, given that the financial complexity of it is, it's more complex than the other products we have in the portfolio.
Mark Keim: Scott, your question is well placed though with many players not having a great experience with SEP, how will they price going is a really good question. As Joe mentioned, we will clearly prioritize our target margins over volume. As Joe said, revenue will flex up, flex down accordingly. But what I like about our strategy is we're in 14 states and I can't predict who is going to price how in any one of those states. We'll put our best pricing out at our target margins. And with the diversification of 14 states, I can't predict any one of them, but across those states we'll be well positioned in some maybe less competitive in others. But we should have a pretty good portfolio outcome at the target margins we're shooting for.
Scott Fidel: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Stephen Baxter: Yes, hi. Thanks for the question. So, it's been a while since the 50% Medicaid retention figure was introduced, I was hoping you could give us a reminder of what your analysis just looks at to arrive at that figure? And then maybe some context about what metrics you're monitoring. Essentially the question is why or why not has this metric changed as a result of the really strong employment market that we're seeing in subsequent quarters and some significant improving the employment levels there? Thank you.
Joe Zubretsky: Sure. Stephen I'll make some preliminary [ph] comments and then kick it to Mark. One of the things we like to remind people when they look at our 50% retention assumption, our membership organically grew approximately 25% since the beginning of the pandemic. If we say we're going to keep half of it that implies a growth rate net of attrition of about 12%. I think what a lot of us forget is that during the period of time if the pandemic never happened, the Medicaid roles will have grown or would have grown anyway, just due the natural growth in the population of the U.S., particularly at the end of the economy, the low wage service end of the economy. So, in our view, the amount of membership we're going to retain from the organic growth during the pandemic is not that much more greater than the natural growth that the industry would have experienced since beginning of the pandemic. Now I'll kick it to Mark about how we went state by state, and really try to drill down and understand the microeconomic effects in each state in order to arrive at our estimate.
Mark Keim: Great. As Joe mentioned since the start of the pandemic, we've organically grown about 25%. If we're going to keep to that, that's about 12%. And if you look at the four or five years that that whole cycle takes, that's growth rate of 2%, 3% a year which is probably organically what Medicaid might have grown at anyway. So, arguably you are right back to where you were if there hadn't been a pandemic. Now, when we look bottoms up and we look at any given state where those members came from, that are in our increased roles, a good component of it is what's sometimes referred to as the woodwork effect, the people that were previously uncovered, but because of the pandemic realized it's a great time to come into the Medicaid pool and get covered, they're certainly going to stay with us. Every time we see a crisis like this the roles of Medicaid move up and never quite go back to where they were. So, at a bare minimum, that woodwork effect will account for some of the increase. And again, over the four to five years, arguably you might be where you were without a pandemic coming out of it, just on normal growth rates.
Joe Zubretsky: And Steven, I also point to even though the unemployment rate national averages really don't mean a whole lot you have to actually look state by state and look at the low wage service economy. That's been ravaged by the economic distress that we're experiencing here in the U.S. That combined with the reservation wage, the wage at which people want to go back to work has increased dramatically. And of course, the great resignation with people just hesitant to go back to work due to other factors. So, the environment in this population certainly suggests that post-pandemic the Medicaid roles will be higher than they were pre-pandemic.
Operator: The next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
George Hill: Yes, good morning. And thanks for taking the question. I guess so this is kind of a broad-based question, but can you talk about how your rate discussions are going with states as you guys contemplate and think about inflation? And maybe just talk a little bit about how Molina kind of sees self-exposed to inflation is clearly a wage pressure internally. Like to what degree does providers wanting exact price kind of take a toll in your book if at all given the Medicaid population? And just like, I ask this question, selfishly, internally, we talked a time about inflation here. We just love to think about how you guys are thinking about inflation impacting kind of your business. And I'd probably ask you to focus on kind of like the ways that might not be obvious, like basically aside from wage pressure.
Joe Zubretsky: Sure. Yes, I'll answer the second part first, because it bears repeating. Clearly, it's been harder to keep our capacity filled and this is industry wide hiring has been very, very difficult. And people are feeling the inflation pressures. And we noted some additional contract labor costs and some additional overtime costs in the first quarter. And people are feeling the stress of the pandemic. We feel that we've been very fair with our population and given them adequate merit increases to key pace with inflation. But we continue to monitor it. Right now, we see no unusual trend or outlook for our labor costs internally. Our biggest challenge is keeping the seats filled and making sure that we never disappoint a customer because we lack the capacity to service the volume. On the medical cost side, we're not seeing it. Now bear in mind the basis, the chassis for our reimbursement is the Medicaid fee schedule. And we're not seeing any dramatic shifts in the Medicaid fee schedules coming out from states. Now, you’ll also negotiate individually a percentage of that Medicaid fee schedule with the individual providers, whether they are physician groups or hospitals. And we're seeing no additional pressure there either. I will tell you that we are comfortable that if we do start to see the inflationary pressures, the real question is, does the rating process keep pace with that? And we believe the answer is yes. States are very much in tune with the trends in medical cost and as are their actuaries. And if we start to see inflationary pressures, the real question is will rates respond? And we believe the answer is yes, they will.
George Hill: That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And our final question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Josh Raskin: Thanks for taking the question. I guess my question will be on Medicare Advantage then this morning, the membership growth remains very strong. I was wondering if you could just speak to where those adds are coming about geographically and from where are they all coming from fee-for-service or competitors. And then just on the yields, it looks like the yields were relatively flat. So, I'm trying to figure out if that's product or geography mix or something else. And I just would have expected a little bit of inflation with risk adjusters. So curious if those were not as additive as expected.
Joe Zubretsky: Well, Josh, our Medicare business is growing nicely. And of course, the margins don't get any better than this. It's a low income, high acuity strategy, MMP anti-SNP and in our MAPD launch, we clearly end the aim, the MAPD product at low-income individual. So, it's a low-income, high-acuity strategy. We grew 6,000 in a quarter up to 148. Some of came in through the Cigna acquisition and the MAPD launch was very, very successful. We have three distribution channels. We have an external broker channel, independent broker channel, captive agent channel and a tele-sales channel. And they are all really working hard to and have increased their productivity here over the last year under new leadership that we have in our distribution channel strategy. So, it's growing very nicely. I mean, the yields are in line with our expectation. Look at the margins in the business at an 85.6% or 86.5% MCR for the quarter and an outlook to be at the bottom end of our long-term target range. And the rate increase that we're getting for next year. We believe our product is competitive, it has all the ancillary services that we allow it to be competitive. Our star ratings are good enough that we can maintain these margins. And we're very, very bullish on the growth prospects of this business over time. We plan to grow it to 158,000 to the end of the year, which would be 10,000 growth just inside of the year.
Operator: We have no further questions. So, this concludes our question-and-answer session, which also concludes today's conference call. Thank you very much for attending and you may not disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-10 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Molina Healthcare Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Krocheski, SVP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Joe Krocheski: Good morning and welcome to Molina Healthcare’s fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina’s President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our fourth quarter earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who are listening to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that remarks made are as of today, Thursday, February 10, 2022 and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our fourth quarter 2021 press release. During our call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, statements regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, the current environment, recent acquisitions, 2022 guidance, our embedded earnings power, and our longer term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K Annual Report filed with the SEC as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and our Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?
Joe Zubretsky: Thank you, Joe and good morning. Today, we will provide updates on several topics; our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2021, our initial 2022 revenue and earnings guidance, and our growth initiatives and reaffirmation of our sustaining profitable growth strategy.  Let me start with the fourth quarter highlights. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of $2.88 with adjusted net income of $170 million and premium revenue of $7.2 billion, an increase of 48% over the prior year. The 88.8% consolidated medical care ratio demonstrates solid performance while managing through pandemic-related challenges. The net effect of COVID increased our consolidated medical care ratio by 150 basis points, decreasing net income per diluted share by approximately $1.50, which is $0.50 more than previously expected.  We managed to 7.4% adjusted G&A ratio, reflecting continued discipline and cost management while making the appropriate investments in our business to fuel growth. We produced an adjusted after tax margin of 2.3%. Excluding the net effect of COVID, our adjusted after tax margin was 3.5%, squarely in line with our long-term target.  We are very pleased with our fourth quarter performance with respect to both the delivery of solid earnings and the focused execution of our profitable growth strategy. The quarter marks the end of yet another very successful year, a year in which we continue to produce a high level of financial performance while navigating the effects of a global pandemic. We executed well and sustained solid operating margins, while driving significant revenue growth.  Now, turning to full year highlight, we reported full year 2021 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $13.54, a 6% increase over initial full year guidance. We absorbed $3.50 of cost related to the net effect of COVID, which was $2 higher than initial guidance, implying $2.80 of improved underlying performance. Excluding the net effect of COVID, our after tax margin was 3.6%, consistent with our long-term target. We generated premium revenue of $26.9 billion, an increase of 47% over our full year 2020 premium revenue and $3.9 billion above our initial 2021 guidance. This strong premium revenue growth was well-balanced between organic growth and bolt on acquisition and is a testament to our successful transition to sustain profitable growth.  From a membership perspective, we ended the year with 5.2 million members, a 1.2 million member increase year-over-year. Notably, this 29% growth across all three segments was enhanced by the suspension of Medicaid redetermination and the special enrollment period in marketplace.  Turning now to our full year performance highlights by line of business. Medicaid, our flagship business, representing 76% of total company premium, produced strong premium revenue growth and stable earnings, as we continue to execute on the underlying fundamentals. For the full year, our Medicaid business achieved a medical care ratio of 88.7% consistent with our long-term MCR target, as moderate net effective COVID was offset by strong medical cost management.  For the year, our diversified portfolio state contracts performed well across all dimensions. Underlying medical costs trend was stable and well controlled, particularly within our growing population of high acuity members, while we continued to deliver high quality care. The right environment was stable and risk sharing corridors recaptured some of our outperformance but many already have been and will continue to be eliminated. For the year, our Medicare medical care ratio was 87.2%, a very strong result, squarely in line with our long-term target range and demonstrating our ability to clinically and financially manage the high acuity members in both our D-SNP and MMP program. This line of business plays an important role in the portfolio, as each year over 30,000 of our Medicaid members turn age 65.  Our marketplace medical care ratio for the full year was 86.9%, well above our long-term target. This reflects the significant cost related the net effect of COVID in our largest geographies, and the high cost impact of the adverse selection related the special enrollment period. Approximately 300,000 members were attracted to our product during this special enrollment period, accounting for 25% of full year marketplace member month. All told, our marketplace performance has been a disappointment. Later, Mark will summarize the steps we have taken in the environmental factors, which will allow us to restore margin to our mid-single digit target in 2022.  You will hear that included in our revenue guidance is a planned reduction in marketplace membership and a related 38% decrease in 2022 marketplace revenue. However, we expect this repositioning of our product to be significantly accretive to 2022 earnings and establish a strong foundation for this business going forward.  2021 was also a very successful year across multiple dimensions of our profitable growth strategy. Specifically, we successfully re-procured our Ohio Medicaid contract, and were awarded a new state contract in Nevada, validating our ability to retain existing state contracts, as well as win new business in new states.  Our M&A engine continued to execute at a high level. During the year, we announced two new acquisition, Cigna’s Texas Medicaid business and AgeWell in New York, for combined premium revenue of approximately $1.7 billion. In October, we closed the New York-based Affinity acquisition, adding over 300,000 members and approximately $1.6 billion of annual premium revenue. And we successfully integrated three previously closed acquisitions representing approximately $5 billion in annual revenue, which continued to provide earnings accretion.  In summary, our full year 2021 enterprise results continue to demonstrate our ability to produce excellent margin, while growing premium revenue and successfully managing through the ongoing clinical and financial impacts of the pandemic.  Turning to our 2022 guidance, beginning with premium revenue; we are very pleased with the continued success of our profitable growth strategy. In 2022, we project premium revenue of approximately $28.5 billion, a 6% year-over-year increase on a reported basis and 14% growth before the effect of regulatory headwinds and the planned decline in marketplace revenue. This is consistent with the initial outlook provided on our third quarter 2021 earnings call. This growth is well-balanced between the new contract win, organic growth in our current footprint and the full annual run rate of our recent acquisition. Incremental to our revenue guidance will be the AgeWell acquisition when closed and any further extension of the public health emergency and the resulting suspension in Medicaid Redeterminations beyond April.  Moving to earnings guidance, our initial full year 2022 adjusted earnings guidance per share is no less than $17 or 26% growth year-over-year. We project a 3.4% adjusted after tax margin, consistent with our long-term target. Our 2022 earnings profile reflects durable and sustainable operating improvement and earnings growth. Included in our 2022 guidance is the realization of $3.50 per share of our 2021 embedded earnings power and additional organic earnings growth, partially offset by the effects of regulatory headwinds. With COVID still providing $2 of earnings per share pressure in 2022 and a few of our acquisition integration not yet fully matured, we still have embedded earnings power remaining to support future earnings growth.  In summary, our 2022 guidance features premium revenue growth of 14% before regulatory headwinds in the marketplace reset and strong earnings per share growth of 26% with key operating and margin metrics squarely in line with the long-term targets we shared at our September 2021 investor conference.  I will now provide a few concluding comments that frame our profitable growth strategy. We remain committed to staying close to the core. We intend to remain a pure play government managed care business, which has very attractive growth characteristics, demographically, and politically. We aspire to provide high quality care to our members, while driving to the lowest cost of delivery to produce attractive margin. We believe we have the right strategy and the right team to execute it. Our strong finish to 2021 and our 2022 guidance position us well and give us great confidence, we can achieve our long-term target of 13% to 15% premium revenue growth and 15% to 18% earnings per share growth on average over time.  As I conclude my remarks, I want to express my gratitude to our management team and our nearly 14,000 Molina colleagues. Their skill, dedication, and steadfast service continued to form the foundation for everything we have achieved, and everything we will achieve in the years to come.  With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials and 2022 guidance. Mark?
Mark Keim: Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. This morning I will discuss some additional details of our fourth quarter and full year performance. I will then turn to the balance sheet and some thoughts on our 2022 guidance. Beginning with our fourth quarter results by segment. In Medicaid, we reported an 88.3% MCR, a strong result that included continuation of costs from the net effect of COVID, offset by strong medical cost management. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 88.3%. During the quarter, the emergence of the Omicron variant had a greater impact on our Medicare population than on our other segments. Focused medical cost management and better than expected risk adjustment offset the net effect of COVID in the quarter.  In marketplace, reported MCR was 92.1%. While COVID infection rates in our marketplace population declined from the peak of the Delta variant in August, the net effect of COVID continued to pressure results in the fourth quarter. The Special Enrollment Period membership, which grew to almost 40% of our marketplace book in the quarter, also contributed to the elevated marketplace MCR.  Turning to full year results, our full year consolidated MCR was 88.3%. This result is modestly above our long-term target, as strong performance in our Medicaid and Medicare businesses was offset by the performance of our marketplace business. Specifically, our full year Medicaid MCR was 88.7%, in line with our 88% to 89% long-term target. Our full year Medicare MCR was 87.2%, in line with our 87% to 88% long-term target. In both Medicaid and Medicare, strong medical cost management, offset the net effect of COVID. Our full year marketplace MCR of 86.9% is well above our 78% to 80% long-term target, and includes approximately 430 basis points of the net effect of COVID as well as approximately 360 basis points from the impact of the Special Enrollment Period.  Turning now to our balance sheet, our capital foundation remains strong. We harvested $218 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, which brought our year end 2021 parent company cash balance the 348 million. Debt at the end of the quarter is 2.1 times trailing 12 months EBITDA. Our debt-to-total cap ratio is 47.8%. However, on a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.8 times and 43.9% respectively. These metrics reflect the conservative leverage position, and ample cash capacity for additional growth and investment.  During the quarter, we redeemed our senior notes due 2022 using the proceeds of our November debt offering of notes due 2032. This refinancing will lower our total interest expense by 50 basis points, and extend our debt maturity towers to 2028 to 2032. More importantly, the transaction marks the final step in our capital restructuring strategy. We have eliminated the costly convertible bonds and addressed all near term maturities at coupon rates well below similarly rated issuers.  Turning to reserves, our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and we continue to be confident in our reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter represented 51 days of medical costs expense, an increase of two days sequentially.  Now turning to guidance, beginning with membership. We ended 2021 with approximately 4.3 million Medicaid members. As discussed, our 2022 guidance reflects the resumption of redeterminations, which we expect will more than offset Medicaid growth drivers and result in 2022 year end membership of approximately 4.1 million members. In Medicare, we ended 2021 with 142,000 members. We expect year end 2022 total Medicare membership of approximately 150,000 members. This reflects strong AEP growth in our MAPD and D-SNP products and the addition of members from our Cigna Texas Medicaid acquisition.  In marketplace, we ended 2021 with 728,000 members. Based on open enrollment, we expect to begin 2022 with approximately 320,000 members, reflecting our strategy to achieve target margins in this business for 2022. Accounting for a limited SEP and normal levels of attrition through the year, we expect to end 2022 with approximately 250,000 members.  Turning now to premium revenue guidance. We expect premium revenue of approximately $28.5 billion or 6% growth. Excluding regulatory headwinds and our marketplace reset, this represents 14% growth over 2021. Specifically, our premium revenue guidance includes the following growth drivers; a full year of the acquired Affinity business, which closed October 25, and the Cigna Texas Medicaid business, which closed on January 1 for a combined $2.2 billion, approximately $1.1 billion of organic Medicaid and Medicare growth in our current footprint, and approximately $400 million for the Nevada Medicaid contract, which began on January 1. Partially offsetting these growth drivers are several headwinds to 2022 revenue growth; 1.2 billion of lower marketplace premium revenue, reflecting our strategy to restore target margins in this business, approximately 400 million related to the resumption of redeterminations, and 500 million from the carve out of pharmacy benefits in our California and Ohio Medicaid contracts.  Consistent with past practice, AgeWell is excluded from our 2022 guidance. We continue to expect this acquisition to close in the third quarter of this year, and will provide $200 million or more of additional premium revenue in 2022 when closed.  Turning now to earnings guidance. We introduced our initial full year 2022 adjusted earnings guidance of no less than $17 per share, reflecting 26% growth over 2021. Our EPS guidance reflects the realization of approximately $3.50 per share of 2021 embedded earnings consisting of approximately $1.50 per share of lower net effective COVID, roughly $0.50 per share for improvement in Medicare risk adjustment, approximately $1 per share, as we attain target margins in Magellan Complete Care and Passport and approximately $0.50 per share for the recently closed Affinity and Cigna Texas Medicaid acquisition.  Our 2022 guidance also includes approximately $0.80 per share of marketplace margin improvement not captured in the lower net effect of COVID. This is offset by the net impact of organic earnings growth and the resumption of redeterminations and the previously discussed pharmacy benefit carve outs. The restoration of marketplace margins to mid-single digits in 2022 will be accomplished through actions already taken. Specifically, we price to a higher medical cost trend, anticipating a more moderate COVID and SEP impact. We redesigned our product offerings, focusing on the silver tier in response to the increase member premium subsidies. Based on recently concluded open enrollment period, we expect to have a higher percentage of renewing members. We also expect a lower mix of special enrollment membership in 2022, based on the revised eligibility rules and our revised product design and distribution strategies. We expect many of these changes will also improve our risk adjustment results.  Moving on to select P&L guidance metrics. We expect our medical care ratio to be approximately 88%. The MCR improvement over 2021 is primarily due to lower net effect of COVID, our actions to improve marketplace performance in 2022, continued progress in medical cost management in our legacy and acquired businesses, and improvement in Medicare risk scores. We expect our adjusted G&A ratio to improve to 6.8%. This reflects discipline cost management, fixed costs leveraged from our revenue growth and mix, offset by continued investment in growth and capabilities. The effective tax rate is expected to be 25.4%. Adjusted after tax margin is expected to be 3.4%, consistent with our long-term targeted range. Weighted average share count is expected to remain flat at 58.4 million shares and we expect that just over 50% of our full year earnings will be produced in the first half of the year. As mentioned, our 2022 guidance includes the realization of $3.50 a share of 2021 embedded earnings, leaving approximately $2.50 a share of embedded earnings power in 2022, comprising the net effect of COVID of approximately $2 per share, which should continue to dissipate and approximately $1 per share, as we attain our target margins on closed deals, including Affinity, Cigna’s Texas Medicaid business and our pending acquisition of AgeWell, partially offset by roughly $0.50 per share a projected Medicaid redetermination impact in 2023. As a reminder, this embedded earnings power does not represent 2023 guidance, but rather an accounting of drivers that are temporarily suppressing our earnings profile, and our current projection of the impact of Medicaid redeterminations post 2022.  This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America, please go ahead.
Kevin Fischbeck: Okay. Great. Thanks. I just wanted to ask about the exchange because that was a surprise for me in this guidance. Can you talk a little bit about how do you think about this business sustainably, just looking back and, I guess, over the last eight years, six of those years, you either grew that business by over 50% or you dropped that business by over 50% in a given year, so very volatile from year to year, it’s hard to see kind of what the strategy is long term. How comfortable are you that this is actually a base that you can grow off of in that low to mid -- sorry, mid to high single digits picture forecasting long term. Thanks. 
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, Kevin. It is Joe. The strategic positioning of the business really hasn’t changed. This is an adjunct to Medicaid. We serve the working poor, we leverage our Medicaid network, we leverage our Medicaid network pricing and our Medicaid footprint. So the strategy hasn’t changed, 90% of our members are fully or partially subsidized. That is the market segment we are approaching. What you’re observing this year is really a capital allocation decision. We never intended to have 728,000 members; that was a function of the Special Enrollment Period, which not only grew membership beyond what anybody expected, but added a significant element of adverse selection. Really what you’re seeing this year is the repositioning of the product, as Mark suggested in his comments, from a pricing perspective, from a structural perspective, from a metallic tear perspective, and from a distribution perspective, to continue to target the working poor and to more emphasize the silver tier that is much easier to price to and to financially manage. So, this is a business where we’re more focused on margin than we are on membership and we will let membership float up and down with our ability to obtain mid-single digit margin. Mark, anything to add?
Mark Keim: I think that’s right, Joe. If you look back to 2020, we were about 318,000 members at the end of the year. 2021 probably would have looked a lot more like 2020, if it wasn’t for the SEP that Joe talked about, which almost none of us in this space knew pretty much at this time last year. Backing out that SEP, 2021 would have looked a lot like 2020. Here we are in ‘22 with an outlook that’s a lot like 2020 and 2021 before the SEP, so I think this level in our portfolio is about the right level, but as Joe mentioned, we will be entirely pricing for margin not for volume.
Kevin Fischbeck: You’re not talking about increased competition or irrational pricing here. This is more of a company-specific decision. I just want to make sure I understand is this a market issue or is it just Molina’s strategy.
Joe Zubretsky: Our strategy is to focus on our Medicaid footprint and to capture individuals who at times income out of Medicaid and have a marketplace product to buy from us at zero premium. That’s always been the strategy. And again, if you look back just a year ago, we’re at 300,000 members and then of course the Special Enrollment Period, added 20,000 to 40,000 members a month while coming on to the to the marketplace roles at a higher acuity. So this is a capital allocation decision. It’s a function of the SEP, it’s a function of the pandemic, and we are comfortable with this business at roughly 7% to 8% of revenue, leveraging our Medicaid footprint, and we think our capital allocation is appropriate as we’ve now repositioned the risk profile of this business.
Kevin Fischbeck: Okay. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Matt Borsch of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Arianna Brady: Good morning. This is Arianna Brady on for Matt Borsch. I was wondering if you could give more detail on the expected timing of the Medicaid redetermination and how much certainty and visibility you have around the process? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Sure. With the public health emergency now having been extended to April, given the notification periods that are required, the first members will not be re-determining, reestablishing eligibility until July 1. We estimate that given that we grew organically, approximately 750,000 members, since the beginning of a pandemic, that equates to approximately $2.9 billion of revenue. We believe that $2.9 billion of revenue will decrease by 1.3 billion to a $1.6 billion residual target and that will happen partially over 2022 and then partially over 2023. Mark, you want to go through the numbers.
Mark Keim: Yeah, just to build on that. So that’s a 1.3 billion decline over time but that’s going to happen over a couple of years. So in my prepared remarks, I mentioned 400 million impacting our 2022 outlook, and the additional 900 million in ‘23. So our target was expectation that we would keep half of these members gain since the start of the pandemic. They’ll come off over time per the public health emergency, and the revenue impacts across the two years are as I mentioned.
Arianna Brady: Great. Thank you. 
Operator: Next question is from Nathan Rich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Nathan Rich: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. I wanted to follow up on the member attrition in marketplace. I guess I’m just trying to think about the 475,000 member decline for 2022 and how that’s balanced between member attrition, potentially due to SEP and maybe the adverse selection that you mentioned, I think, the 300,000 that you saw sign up during that period and any competitive factors that you may have seen in the in the market. And Mark, maybe could help us think about how much marketplace margins were impacted by that adverse selection dynamic in 2021, as we think about where kind of marketplace margins ended the year and the improvement that’s contemplated to get to mid-single digit margins for 2022.
Joe Zubretsky: Well, first on the membership and revenue question, what’s interesting and should be noted, that although membership is down by over 60%, revenue is down by less than 40% because we shifted the book to the silver tier, the silver tier has a much richer product design and therefore revenue flow. So the PMPM revenue on silver is much higher. So the operating leverage is very positive. With respect to the margin, we are very confident on a return to mid-single digit. This produced -- this business -- due to the SEP and a pandemic, this business produced a low-single digit margin loss on $3 billion of revenue in 2021. We expect now to return that to a mid-single digit margin gain on $2 billion of revenue in 2022. So, sort of a seven to eight point increase in margins, a lot of it due to the elimination of the COVID pandemic, and much of it also due to the adverse selection that the SEP produced. Mark, the numbers?
Mark Keim: Yeah, absolutely. So if you look at our membership, as you point out, we’re down some 60% end of ‘21 versus ‘22 but as Joe mentioned, our revenues in marketplace are down 38%. Why the disconnect? Within our new membership is a very different mix of bronze versus silver. Last year, 2021, we had about 41% of our portfolio in bronze, that’ll be down to 15% in 2022. As I’m sure you know the PMPM, the revenue PMPMs are quite different between bronze and silver, they’re about 300 in bronze, and about 550 in silver on average across the portfolio. So that kind of offsets a lot of the volume decline, just on higher PMPMs on those members.  Now on the margins, Joe mentioned last year it’s 86.9 MCR but we’re tracking this year to a 79, which is smack in the middle of our long-term guidance for marketplace MLR. A couple of things that bridges from last year two this year, obviously, we took significant pricing, as we looked into the New Year. Your specific question around what did SEP and COVID cost us? I think we mentioned at a high level in our prepared remarks, we carried across marketplace 430 basis points of COVID last year and 360 basis points from the SEP. So you put those two together that’s 8% of headwind that I’m not expecting in the New Year. COVID, we all have a more optimistic outlook for COVID in the New Year and SEP, the market will be behaved differently this year, the regulations are different, pure people can sign up and our distribution strategy puts us in a different place, I just don’t think we’ll have that exposure. So you get the 8% pricing coming into the New Year. You remove that headwind of COVID and SEP throw a trend assumption on there for what a normalized trend assumption could be and you have a very clear path to that high 70%, 79% MLR I’m talking about.
Nathan Rich: Thanks. Appreciate the detail. 
Operator: The next question is from Stephen Baxter of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. 
Stephen Baxter: Hi. Thanks for the updated view on earnings power. I guess just, first, appreciated actions were required on the exchange business. I guess, how should we think about the foregone membership there is impacting the earnings power dynamics you’ve talked about through 2021? It seems like, in aggregate you’re kind of at the same ballpark as you were before, just trying to make sure I can follow that. And then second, just sort of appreciate if you could provide a little more detail on what’s still in the $2 of COVID pressure at this point. It sounds like maybe you’re getting back $0.50 of the dollar per scores, maybe that’s half -- or excuse me a quarter of it. But we think about the balance, it sounds like you’re saying that all three businesses, I think, will be roughly a target margins. Just trying to understand where you feel like the opportunity still is. Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, Stephen. You mentioned the embedded earnings power, which is not a theoretical construct, we didn’t construct it in the abstract, it’s real. And as we previously disclosed, sitting on top of our $13.50 actual results for 2021, about $6.50 was embedded earnings power. Clearly, with the significant impact of the pandemic, was something reasonable to account for. And because we’ve been so acquisitive, we thought it was also helpful to account for the growing accretion of our closed acquisition. So sitting on top of our $13.50 results in ‘21 was an additional $6.50 in embedded earnings. We have harvested $3.50 of that embedded earnings inside our $17 -- at least $17 plan for 2022. Also, as you suggested, sitting on top of the $17 is an additional $2.50 of continued embedded earnings power, due to the net effect of COVID, due to the Affinity and Cigna Texas acquisitions, which are new to the portfolio and AgeWell will add a little bit as well. So it’s a real construct, the Embedded earnings have been harvested inside the 2022 plan, and some still exists to add to future earnings growth here over time.  And the net effect is COVID, we account for three things. We account for the direct cost of COVID-related care, we attempt to estimate the effect of utilization curtailment due to the pandemic, and then we account for the effects of the corridor. As we previously suggested, the corridors were significant in 2021. We had nine of them that were financially significant that has been reduced to three for 2022. So they linger on into ‘22 in the state of Washington, Ohio, and Mississippi. We have every confidence when the PAHD [phonetic] ends, they too will be eliminated. But that’s really what’s in the $2 net effective COVID for 2022 are the lingering effects of three corridor. 
Stephen Baxter: Thanks for color. 
Operator: The next question is from Michael Hall of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. 
Michael Hall: Hey, thank you guys. Appreciate the color on the exchanges, I understand you’re pretty confident on double digit margin to appears but just wanted to clarify, so a large percent of these lives that were lost, basically, were very low to no margin, maybe even negative margin, so earnings impact was basically negligible. And looking forward, are you now at a place where the portfolio is fully right-sized, you’re ready to charge ahead at 5% to 8% long-term growth a year?
Joe Zubretsky: Yes. Just, again, some additional color, the answer is yes, that special enrollment membership ran at a very high loss ratio. In fact, the volume, it represented about 40% of the member month volume in the fourth quarter alone and 25% for the year; ran at 105% MCR in the fourth quarter and just about 100% for the full year. So that was a significant contribution to our issues this year. As Mark suggested, blend it over the entire year, it was 260 basis points of MCR pressure, so we expect that to completely reverse into next year. The business is positioned where it should have been, pre-SEP. As I said, we follow our Medicaid footprint, we sell to highly subsidized members. Now that we’ve repositioned the mix to more silver than bronze, we have every confident that this is a solid baseline, mid-single digit margins, and probably mid to low single digit growth here over the foreseeable future.
Operator: The next question is from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead. 
Josh Raskin: Thanks. Good morning. I’ve got a bigger picture question around where Molina is in their sort of corporate life cycle. And obviously the turnaround, Joe, since you’ve got there about four years ago, it’s been much more successful than I think anyone expected and feels mainly driven by this big margin improvement and some opportunistic M&A. But it seems as though we’re getting to a point where there are some top line headwinds, and it’s sort of ebbing and flowing. And as you look over the next few years, I’m curious about the plan to extract more value from that membership, not just the embedded earnings that you talked about, but real value over the long term. And are we at a point where scale and maybe other non-insurance-based capabilities become more important? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: It certainly is part of our strategic planning process to look at all opportunities for allocation of capital. And yes, we’re well aware of the capability builds that happen in other companies, we’re well aware of vertical integration with providers. We believe, for the foreseeable future, there is so much growth, both in the demographics, actual membership growth, particularly in the high acuity segment, that we don’t have to look far beyond our ability to take capitated risks, particularly with high acuity members, manage it really well, be a rate taker in Medicaid, grow Medicare, and use this ballast of marketplace, as this residual mechanism, that we don’t need to do much beyond that, to sustain the growth around. We never would have suggested a 13% to 15% revenue growth and 15% to 18% EPS growth by 2025, if we didn’t see enough runway to continue growing the business and in the swim lanes we’re in. So certainly in our strategic planning process, we always look at capability build, we are not going to allocate capital to vertically integrate with providers. For us, we do not think that’s a good deployment of capital. But there’s so much runway with the number of lives that will go managed and particularly the high acuity lives that we don’t need to do much beyond that.
Josh Raskin: Very helpful. Thanks. 
Operator: The next question is from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. 
Justin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions here on the exchanges. First, Joe, going back to the third quarter, you had talked about exchange membership being flat to down. So you certainly indicated that there could be some pressure here, but the fact that flat was in the ballpark, potentially, right the 60% decline is certainly more than I think any of us expected. So I was hoping you could tell us a little bit more about what happened between the third quarter and today that so significantly changed the outlook for the exchanges, like did you cut commissions or something? Is there something structural that you did or is this just pie or turn? What can you tell?
Joe Zubretsky: Well, certainly all the strategies that we were executing for 2022 were in place during the third quarter, they had to be, as we’re going into open enrollment. Yes, membership is down but we withdrew in just about all of our markets the bronze product. Now, how many of those members were going to then take up a Molina-based silver product was a matter of estimation. Would I have hoped to end up with more membership if it was silver? Sure but 320,000 out of the gate is just fine. So as you take a complete product set off the shelf, except in three states where the circumstances are quite different, so basically pull it off the shelf, it was hard to know how much of that membership would have stayed in a Molina product with silver. But the good news is the members that we do have, most of them are renewal members, and 85% of them are silver. So irrespective of where we started and where we ended up, we’re ending up in a really, really good place that portends well for the production of the mid-single digit margin.
Justin Lake: Great. And then I’d love to get your opinion on a couple of things. You talked about the impact of the Special Enrollment Period, both in margins and membership. I’d love to hear your view on like, how sticky do you think that membership is, in terms of 2022, right, if we don’t have those Special Enrollment Period, like what do you think happens with those members? Also, there’s a lot of talk about the fact that with Medicaid redetermination, we could see a lot of those members move from Medicaid over to the exchanges. So, what do you think happens with those two things specifically? And then maybe you can give us your kind of view of what you think the marketplace is going to do in terms of enrollment overall, given all those different swing factors in 2022 versus 2021? Do you think it grows or shrinks?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure. Well, certainly. When insurance is available to you, anytime you need it, you buy it, and it should be no surprise that the effects of the adverse selection were significant. So the question then becomes, what happens to that cohort, a lot of the uptake during the special enrollment period was bronze. So to the extent that that product was one that was affordable, and no Molina bronze product was available, they either renewed with us into silver or didn’t renew us at all. The other fact that’s really important is if the acuity of the member didn’t change, they’re still high acuity, but now we still have them. The fact that we’ve now had them for over a year means that we’ll be able to capture risk scoring more appropriately and the fact that they’re in silver means the risk score will count for more revenue. So the fact that some of these members renewed into the renewal book into 2022 is fine, the number is not very high, but now we have visibility into their acuity, we will be able to capture the risk score and at least earn a silver product.  Long term, my comments are going to really extend to our strategy, which is this is a high subsidy strategy to follow our Medicaid footprint. My view of this has always been and I’m looking -- I was always looking for the right word, it’s a residual market for Medicaid. As members get part time jobs and have an income level just above Medicaid, they’re probably eligible for highly subsidized marketplace product. Our strategy has always been to target that market. Now, our execution has been less than perfect on that but that’s always been the strategy. So this is going to grow with the working poor, with the Medicaid population as people flex up and down. So we think there, as we said, an Investor Day low-single digit growth rate, mid to -- I think it’s 5% to 8%, I think is the right number. And we’re confident that that’s the way the business will grow with a yield that’s probably half of that and membership growth that’s another half of that. But it’s a product that should flex up and down with Medicaid as the Medicaid rolls move up and down. 
Mark Keim: And Justin, it is Mark. The only thing I’d add to that is I think you asked about redetermination as well. As you know we have the projections for some revenue coming off and some members through redetermination, what we don’t have is those members picked up in our marketplace product at the margins we expect to drive here that is all upside to our projections. But we have a meaningful effort out there to pick up the redetermination members in our marketplace and Medicare in some case products through cross sell, which has meaningful upside to the numbers we’ve talked about today. 
Justin Lake: Right. Thanks. 
Operator: Your next question is from AJ Rice of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
AJ Rice: Hi, everybody. Let me just ask you about the Medicaid business. So can you comment on what the RFP pipeline looks like, where the opportunities are, where the defending requirements might be? And specifically, maybe comment on California that’s been in the press lately with discussion about this idea with Kaiser Permanente. Do you think that’s going to be a normal RFP process, from your perspective or are there nuances of difference? And I don’t think you’ve commented on your expectations for the ‘22 average composite rating crease across your state that you’re seeing in Medicaid. And I wonder if I’ve missed that or if you would give that.
Joe Zubretsky: AJ, first, thanks for asking about Medicaid. It’s obviously 80% of the revenue base and we couldn’t be more pleased with the result that the Medicaid team produced in 2021 and the plan for ‘22. I mean, it’s now a total of nearly $24 billion of revenue, $23 billion of premium revenue, and it’s going to operate north of a 3% after tax margin. We continue to win new business. And yes, we do have to retain and defend our existing contracts, as you suggested. The California RFP was distributed just yesterday. We believe the Texas RFP will be distributed late in the first quarter and Mississippi is in the middle of a proposal writing effort, as we sit here today. Most of the other procurements are longer dated, but those are the three, we have a high confidence in all three of them. We run a really well run business in California, we have a great team. As you know, it’s a pretty complex state with respect to how the region’s work.  And yes, I think us and the rest of the managed care industry were disappointed that Kaiser was awarded a no bid contract but it’s not as though it’s some transformational event that’s going to reshape the entire medical landscape, it’s incremental. In fact, most of the impact will be in tooth plan regions where the local health plans have major share. So, high confidence in California, high confidence in Texas. In fact, we say that the fact that the regulatory process for the Cigna acquisition went so well, that it is testimony to the high regard the state holds us in with respect to the STAR+PLUS population.  With respect to new states, as you know, there’s $108 billion pipeline over four to five years. We certainly won’t chase every opportunity in every state. We are very selective as to where we think we can win evaluating a series of criteria. But our proposal writing team, our business development team, are extremely active, and to date have demonstrated a great deal of success with a Kentucky win and Nevada win and defending the Ohio contract. So the business is performing extremely well and at 80% of revenue, it needs to enhance and the outlook for growth, both organically and inorganically, is pretty robust.
AJ Rice: Okay. Any thoughts on the rate increase for ‘22 on average?
Joe Zubretsky: I don’t think we’ve given a specific percentage but the rate increase was low-single digit across in Medicaid across the book. We are comfortable with its actuarial soundness. It has generally kept pace with our view of normalized medical costs trend, which also was low-single digit. So the rate environment is stable. It’s rational, the principle of actuarial soundness and the return to a prospective setting of rates based on a sound medical baseline and the removal of these corridors seems to be happening as quickly as we originally estimated. 
AJ Rice: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. 
Operator: The next question is from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Steven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning, I guess two more interrelated questions on marketplace. You know, first, just with the drop off in membership by 65% from 728 to 250. As we think about the quarterly cadence around that, do you have any sense where that’ll shake out at the end of the first quarter in particular? And then is it possible that the 250 year end number, maybe, it’s just conservative around the progression around all this? And then the second question, maybe just ask it now to this kind of interrelated, with the 65% decline in membership, revenue is expected to decline 38%. As we think about the delta between those two numbers, how much of that is just driven by that shift from bronze to silver versus just premium increases, just trying to get a proxy for what drives the delta between that two, a little more color on that?
Joe Zubretsky: Most of it is the shift from bronze to silver, which is a very significant differential in the PMPM revenues that those products generate. But we did go for it and attain a highest single digit rate increase in that business. In terms of where we start, and where we end, I think we said we started with 323 [phonetic] and 30,000 members, after the whole Annual Enrollment period. We are projecting pre-pandemic levels of attrition, which averaged 1.5% to 2% a month. Now, if that doesn’t happen, we’ll end up with more than 250,000 members by year end. We’re also expecting not to pick up many members during Special Enrollment. As you know, the Special Enrollment Period still exists but the eligibility requirements have been significantly reduced to where only people at less than 150% of Federal Poverty Level income are eligible. So, if we – we won’t pick up SEP members, we’re confident in that and if attrition is at 1.5% to 2% a year, the 250,000 number by year end is about where we will end.
Steven Valiquette: Okay, all right. Got it. Thanks.
Operator: The next question is from Scott Fidel of Stephens. Please go ahead.
Scott Fidel.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just interested if you can give us your initial thoughts on the 2023 MA [phonetic] advance notice? And then just walk us through your capital priorities and how you think about capital appointment at GR in terms of M&A opportunity, buybacks, etc. Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Sure. Obviously, like the rest of the industry, we were pleased with the advanced notice, second year in a row that it looked very attractive on its surface. We’ve grown our Medicare business, even though half of it is demonstrations, which likely won’t grow, the other half is his marketing business and the DSNP product that will grow. And in the fact we are growing from 142,000 to 152,000 members is significant. So we’re really happy with the growth characteristics of the business. We think two years straight of rate increases, give us a lot of room to put the right benefits in the product to rate it appropriately, and to win new business and have margins in the mid-single digit after tax territory where we’re positioned today. So we’re really bullish on our Medicare business and we have a great team that will grow that business here over the foreseeable future, as we said in our Investor Day. Capital deployment, mark?
Mark Keim: So on the capital side, I feel really good about our dry powder. We’re starting off the year with a good cash balance at the parent. Our projected cash flow for the year is strong. And you can see the leverage metrics gives me a lot of room to raise more if I needed. On the M&A side, I’m encouraged by what we’re seeing for the year. Number of things in the hopper right now; of course, they all move at their own speed, we never make commitments about when they might happen but good line of sight on a number of targets, which I’m hoping to deploy the capital against. What Joe and I have always been adamant about, though, is share repurchases, when and where appropriate. There’s some small amount that is just not part of our normal hygiene that we would probably do during the course of the year. Not a big commitment by any means but just on an annual basis, there is some small amount we like to do. Part of that’s, though, a function of what the M&A pipeline turns out on, we’ll have to see how that plays out on the year.
Operator: The next question is from George Hill of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
George Hill: Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I know a lot has been covered here, so I just was going to ask one about the PBM carve-ins. And I guess could you talk about, is the impact that meaningful at all? I didn’t hear you guys called out in the prepared commentary and didn’t have anything on in my notes. So maybe just kind of maybe walk through the mechanics, how does it impact the income statement? Is there any meaningful impact of the financials from the PBM carve-ins?
Joe Zubretsky: I think, you are, George, referring to the PBM carve outs, yes in California. 
George Hill: Carve out for you guys, carve in to the state. 
Joe Zubretsky: Okay. Okay. Thank you. Just wanted to make sure we’re talking about the same thing. Sure, we have a $500 million revenue decrement, in our forecast for the year due to the carve outs, which is a full year of California and a half a year of Ohio. And obviously, there’s margin implication to that. These revenues that are taken out into a fee for service environment generally carry with them the average Medicaid margin. So think of it as the loss of the average Medicaid margins on $500 million of revenue.
George Hill: Helpful. Thank you. 
Operator: And the last question comes from Gary Taylor of Cowen. Please go ahead.
Gary Taylor: Hi, good morning. Most of my questions sort of touched on one way or the other, but just refining a little bit. Do you have any -- on the non-SEC exchange population, do you have any retention figures on that piece versus what it historically look like or it is too early?
Joe Zubretsky: Gary, want to make sure we answer your question. When you say retention, you’re talking about throughout the year our lapse rate or you’re talking about how many members renew from the prior year?
Gary Taylor: The latter. 
Mark Keim: Yeah, we do have pretty good insight at this point, a much better proportion of our starting membership this year is renewal, meaningfully better than say even last year. Part of that is with the smaller book, a number of our members rolled over with us. So we kept a much higher percentage of renewal members this year and that’s a really good thing because we know those members better, we have the history on them and that converts right into risk adjustment, and starting the year with a much better risk adjustment position and obviously being able to code those members right out of the gate. So we feel good about that higher level of renewals, and it does translate into risk adjustments. 
Gary Taylor: Right. And then my second one was on the Medicare risk adjustment headwinds related to the pandemic, I thought at one point, you cited that $1, it sounds like you’re saying you’re going to recoup $0.50 of that in 2022. Does it still mean there’s another $0.50 for that and that’s maybe kind of embedded in your remaining COVID recapture or has the dollar changed or am I just [Multiple Speakers]. 
Mark Keim: No. It’s Mark. Your memory is quite good. We, we used to talk about $1 of Medicare risk score in our embedded earnings. That is we just weren’t able to get out there and do the in-home assessments and the risk scoring during the pandemic the way we had historically, so we were carrying $1. Now the good news is late in the third quarter, especially in the fourth quarter, we were actually able to realize part of that. CMS extended the window for submissions from 2020, which meant we were able to get a little bit more of that into the back half of ‘21. As a result, that dollar fell to $0.50 at the end of the year and will realize that $0.50 in our guidance. So the dollar we used to talk about $0.50 you got in third and fourth quarters, the other $0.50 you’re getting in guidance at it. 
Gary Taylor: Got it. Okay, thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question and answer session and today’s conference. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-28 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Molina Healthcare Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Krocheski. Please go ahead.
Joe Krocheski: Good morning and welcome to Molina Healthcare's third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our third quarter earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who are listening to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that remarks made are as of today, Thursday, October 28, 2021 and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our third quarter 2021 press release. During our call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, statements regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, the current environment, recent acquisitions, 2021 guidance, 2022 premium revenue outlook, our embedded earnings power, and our longer term outlook and expected EPS growth. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report for the 2020 year filed with the SEC as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and our Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?
Joe Zubretsky: Thank you, Joe and good morning. Today, we will provide you with updates on several topics: Our financial results for the third quarter of 2021; our 2021 guidance in the context of our third quarter results; our initial outlook for 2022 premium revenue and embedded earnings power; and lastly our growth initiatives and reaffirmation of our outlook for the future. Let me start with the third quarter highlights. Last night we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of $2.83 with adjusted net income of $164 million and premium revenue of $6.8 billion. The 88.9% consolidated medical care ratio demonstrates solid performance while managing through pandemic-related challenges. The net effect of COVID increased our consolidated medical care ratio by 110 basis points and decreased net income per diluted share by approximately $1. We managed to a 7.3% adjusted G&A ratio reflecting continued discipline in cost management while making the appropriate investments in our business to fuel growth. We produced an after-tax margin of 2.3% meeting our third quarter expectations. Our year-to-date performance metrics highlighted by an 88% MCR, a 7.1% adjusted G&A ratio and a 3.1% adjusted after-tax margin were all squarely in line with our nine-month expectations, despite the significant COVID-related impacts we experienced, totaling $2 per share year-to-date. And we accomplished all of this as year-to-date, we generated approximately 50% year-over-year premium revenue growth, successfully integrated businesses, representing approximately $5 billion in annual revenue and continue to execute on our growth initiatives. In summary, we are very pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. We executed well, delivered solid operating earnings and continued to drive our growth strategy. Let me provide some additional commentary, related to our third quarter performance. As we stated in the second quarter, year-over-year comparisons are less meaningful than they would be in a typical year, due to pandemic-related effects. Therefore, we will again focus our comments this morning on sequential comparisons. In the third quarter, we produced premium revenue of $6.8 billion a 3.3% increase over the second quarter of 2021, reflecting increased membership across our entire portfolio. We ended the quarter with approximately 4.8 million members, an increase of 142,000 members over the second quarter of 2021. We have now grown to serve approximately 800,000 additional members since the end of 2020 a 20% increase. Our Medicaid enrollment at the end of the quarter was approximately four million members, an increase of 53,000 over the second quarter of 2021. This increase was due primarily to the continuing suspension of Medicaid redeterminations, which has resulted in an increase of over 700,000 Medicaid members since the beginning of the pandemic. Our Medicare membership was 138,000 at the end of the quarter, an increase of 8,000 members driven primarily by organic growth as we follow our Medicaid footprint with an enhanced distribution strategy. Our Marketplace membership was 719,000 at the end of the quarter representing growth of 81,000 members over the second quarter of 2021, due to continued lower-than-expected attrition rates and membership additions during the special enrollment period which ended in mid-August. Turning now to our medical margin performance in the third quarter by line of business. Medicaid our flagship business, representing 77% of premium continues to drive premium revenue growth and stable earnings, as we execute on the underlying fundamentals. For the quarter, our Medicaid business achieved a medical care ratio of 89.6%, consistent with our expectations as the net effect of COVID was notable but manageable. Year-to-date our well-diversified portfolio of state contracts continues to perform well across all dimensions. Medical cost trend is stable and well controlled while we continue to deliver high-quality care particularly to high-acuity populations. The underlying rate environment is stable. Risk-sharing corridors continue to capture some of our outperformance, but many have been and continue to be eliminated. We are winning new state contracts and we are consistently finding attractive acquisition opportunities. Moving on to Medicare. Our Medicare results exceeded our expectations. For the quarter, our medical care ratio was 82.8%. Lower net effect of COVID including utilization curtailment and risk corridor true-ups combined with improved risk adjustment revenue served to drive a 490 basis point sequential improvement in the MCR. Our year-to-date Medicare MCR of 86.8% better reflects the underlying performance of this business and demonstrates our ability to clinically and financially manage the high-acuity lives in both our DSNP and MMP programs. Our Marketplace medical care ratio in the quarter was 91.3%. This reflects increased costs related to the net effect of COVID, the impact of the special enrollment period and the natural seasonality of the business. Recall that many of the new members we attracted were in regions disproportionately affected by COVID particularly in Texas. Moreover, we experienced higher non-COVID utilization by members enrolled to the special enrollment period, due to the relaxed eligibility guidelines. Our year-to-date Marketplace MCR was 84.8% and includes over 500 basis points of pressure from the net effect of COVID as well as 280 basis points of impact from the special enrollment period. We remain confident that we can achieve mid-single-digit pre-tax margins in 2022. We will accomplish this through actions already taken and changes to the environment that have already occurred. Specifically we priced to a higher medical cost trend. We redesigned our product offerings focusing on the silver tier in response to the increased premium subsidies and we note the conclusion of the 2021 special enrollment period and the more restrictive 2022 special enrollment eligibility rules. In summary, our third quarter and year-to-date enterprise results continued to demonstrate our ability to produce excellent margins while growing top-line revenue and successfully managing through the ongoing clinical and financial impacts of the pandemic. Turning to our 2021 guidance beginning with premium revenue. At our recent investor conference, we increased our 2021 premium revenue guidance to be more than $26 billion. With our third quarter results and the closing of Affinity, we are now projecting 2021 premium revenue of no less than $26.5 billion, which represents a 45% increase over the full year 2020. We are maintaining our full year 2021 earnings guidance of no less than $13.25 per share. This represents a $0.50 increase compared to the midpoint of our initial 2021 guidance despite absorbing an additional $1.50 per share from the net effect of COVID, revealing an improvement of $2 per share in underlying performance. Excluding the impact of the net effect of COVID, our 2021 guidance results in a 3.4% after-tax margin. This performance is consistent with our initial 2021 guidance and squarely in line with our long-term target margin expectations. We do, however, remain cautious in projecting our fourth quarter earnings due to a variety of exogenous factors, primarily related to the net effects of COVID across all of our businesses. Turning now to our 2022 revenue outlook. At our September investor conference, we provided the components of our initial 2022 premium revenue outlook that delivers premium revenue growth of more than $3 billion over 2021 guidance. Specifically $2.3 billion from already announced acquisitions including Affinity, which we just recently closed and the Cigna Texas Medicaid business, which we expect to close in January of 2022. Organic growth of $1 billion, representing approximately 4% growth across our current footprint. Approximately $400 million for our Nevada Medicaid launch, partially offset by a projected $500 million impact from redeterminations, which we expect to occur throughout 2022. Since then, we announced the AgeWell acquisition. Any incremental revenue from AgeWell in 2022 would likely be offset by pharmacy carve-outs in California and Ohio. A reminder, this 2022 outlook is prior to Marketplace membership changes and any additional strategic initiatives and acquisitions. Bear in mind that our Marketplace approach in 2022 emphasizes margin over membership growth. At this early stage, we expect 2022 Marketplace membership to be flat to down when compared to 2021. No matter where the Marketplace membership and revenue eventually lands, we expect the business to generate mid single digit pre-tax margins in 2022. Turning now to our longer term growth outlook. At our September investor conference, we laid out our strategy for sustaining profitable growth, a strategy that delivers 13% to 15% annual premium revenue growth off of our 2022 baseline. We expect approximately two-thirds of that growth to be organic, driven by a combination of underlying industry growth in a set of specific strategic initiatives that we described in detail. The remaining one-third will be derived from inorganic growth. The achievement, of which is supported by our current track record of M&A execution. Our profitable growth outlook as of sustaining our 4% to 5% pre-tax margins, harvesting the potential for operating leverage and accretively deploying excess capital to deliver a very attractive EPS growth rate of 15% to 18% on average overtime. The components of this growth engine are well established and working. Our year-to-date performance is testimony to the strength of that growth engine. Specifically, the Nevada Medicaid Contract Award speaks to our ability to win new state contracts to drive organic growth, and we continue to participate in additional RFPs we find attractive. And our M&A team continues to deliver. In addition to the Cigna Texas Medicaid business we announced earlier this year, this month we announced the acquisition of AgeWell managed long-term care business in New York for a purchase price of less than 20% of revenue. This acquisition complements our expanding New York footprint, serving high-acuity populations in the state. AgeWell serves approximately 13,000 members, with full year 2020 premium revenue of approximately $700 million. We expect AgeWell to deliver accretion of $0.15 to $0.20 per diluted share in the first full year of ownership. The M&A target pipeline is vibrant, and gives us confidence in continued execution. To recap our strategy, we remain committed to staying close to the core. We are a pure-play government managed care business. We believe the government managed care business has very attractive growth characteristics, demographically and politically. We aspire to provide high-quality care to our members, while driving to the lowest cost of delivery to produce attractive margins in this high-growth industry. We believe we have the right strategy and the right team to execute our sustaining profitable growth agenda. We remain extremely confident, that we can achieve our long-term targets of 13% to 15% premium revenue growth and 15% to 18% earnings per share growth. As I conclude my remarks, I want to express my gratitude to our management team and our nearly 13,000 Molina colleagues. Their skill, dedication, and steadfast service continue to form the foundation for everything we have achieved and everything we will achieve in the years to come. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Keim, for some additional color on the financials. Mark?
Mark Keim: Thanks, Joe, and good morning everyone. This morning I will discuss some additional details of our third quarter performance, and then turn to the balance sheet and some thoughts on our 2021 guidance. Beginning with our third quarter results. The net effect of COVID negatively impacted third quarter results by $77 million or approximately 110 basis points of our reported 88.9% MCR. During the quarter, we experienced higher COVID-related inpatient costs that began to taper off late in September. While the total company net effect of COVID at about $1 per share was very similar to the prior quarter, the components and impacts vary greatly within our segments. Total company MCR is up 50 basis points on several segment-specific items. In Medicaid, the net effect of COVID was a cost of $49 million or approximately 80 basis points of our reported 89.6% MCR. Sequentially, the 60 basis point increase in our Medicaid MCR over second quarter was driven largely by this higher net effect of COVID in the quarter. Our year-to-date MCR is 88.8%. We continue to expect the full year Medicaid MCR to be in the high 80s. In Medicare, the net effect of COVID had a favorable impact of approximately $16 million or 180 basis points of our reported 82.8% MCR. Sequentially, the 490 basis point improvement in our Medicare MCR was driven by two items. Approximately 390 basis point improvement in net effect of COVID, which includes curtailment and corridor related true-ups; and approximately 100 basis points related to improved risk adjustment revenue. Our year-to-date Medicare MCR is 86.8%. We continue to expect the full year Medicare MCR in the high 80s. In Marketplace the net effect of COVID was a cost of approximately $44 million or 570 basis points of our 91.3% MCR in the quarter. Sequentially, our Marketplace MCR increased approximately 640 basis points reflecting several items. Approximately 90 basis points of higher net effect of COVID, roughly 250 basis points from normal third quarter seasonality associated with members reaching their policy deductible limits, and approximately 300 basis points from higher non-COVID utilization by members enrolled through the special enrollment period and higher expected risk adjustment expense. Our year-to-date Marketplace MCR of 84.8% includes over 500 basis points of the net effect of COVID, as well as 280 basis points from the impact of the special enrollment period. Due to the higher-than-expected impact we now expect Marketplace pretax margins for the full year 2021 to moderate to roughly breakeven. We expect our 2022 marketplace pretax margin will be squarely in line with our mid-single-digit pretax margin target. Turning now to our balance sheet. Our capital foundation remains strong. We harvested $127 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter which brought our parent company cash balance to $703 million at the end of the quarter. We have ample capacity to fund the announced acquisitions and additional strategic initiatives. At our current margins, we generate significant excess cash and additional debt capacity. At our investor conference in September, we sized that recurring parent cash capacity at $1.4 billion annually. Importantly as we grow that cash capacity also grows. Turning to reserves. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and we remain confident in our reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter represented 49 days of medical cost expense, an increase of one day sequentially. Prior period reserve development in the third quarter was modestly favorable, but any P&L impact was mostly absorbed by the COVID-related risk corridors. Debt at the end of the quarter is 2.3x trailing 12-month EBITDA. Our debt-to-cap ratio was 48%. However, on a net debt basis net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.6x and 40% respectively. These metrics reflect a conservative leverage position. A few additional comments related to our guidance. We increased our full year 2021 premium revenue guidance to no less than $26.5 billion reflecting the closing of Affinity and growth in all segments. Earnings per share guidance remains at no less than $13.25 per share which reflects the following: the net effect of COVID which we recently increased to approximately $3 per share for the full year, offset by our underlying outperformance and continued caution in forecasting utilization trends in the remaining months of the year due to the COVID pandemic. As previously conveyed, we continue to believe the incremental embedded earnings power of the company is in excess of $6 per share. This is composed of several items: the net effect of COVID of approximately $3 per share that should dissipate as the pandemic subsides; Medicare risk score disruption of approximately $1 per share; and as we obtain our target margins on the closed deals including Magellan Complete Care Passport and Affinity and the pending acquisitions of Cigna's Texas Medicaid business and AgeWell, we expect to achieve additional adjusted earnings per share well in excess of $2. As a reminder, this embedded earnings power does not represent 2022 guidance, but rather an accounting of the dynamic impacts that are temporarily suppressing our earnings profile. There are many other items that will affect our actual earnings guidance for 2022, including several possible scenarios for the impact of Marketplace membership, as well as the ongoing impact of the pandemic and ongoing strategic initiatives. In short, our 2021 earnings jumping off point into 2022 remains very strong. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Matt Borsch: Yes. I was just hoping we could revisit the topic of the redeterminations and how you see that playing out next year? I know you talked at the beginning of the call about 700,000 members that you estimate have an added as a result of redeterminations. So I'm curious, as said, how many of those you think will roll off if not perhaps potentially more and overall timeframe?
Joe Zubretsky: Matt, we are forecasting that when the public health emergency ends and all the redetermination activity is fulfilled that we will end up with half the members we gained during the pandemic. And we say that, because the low-wage service economy has been rapid. The stimulus money is still out there. And time has shown that over past recessions, when Medicaid rolls have swelled, they stay increased when the crisis abates. So we're pretty confident that, membership in Medicaid post-pandemic will exceed Medicaid membership pre-pandemic. Now, over what period is a matter of judgment as you know the PHE is now planned to extend into mid-January, which means the first members with notice periods and membership notification periods the first members are eligible to roll off the books on April 1. So we have forecasted that we will be down $500 million in revenue in 2022, an additional $800 million in revenue in 2023. So the $2.9 billion of revenue gained will result in $1.6 billion of permanent revenue gain, $500 million in 2022, an additional $800 million in 2023, $2.9 billion moving to $1.6 billion.
Matt Borsch: Fantastic. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Josh Raskin: Thanks. Good morning. My question is just on that embedded earnings power that you guys speak to. I'm trying to figure out the cadence of realizing sort of those embedded earnings and COVID feels a little bit like a step function potentially next year. So I'm just curious if there's big sort of step function impacts, or if this is more a series of many, many incremental benefits, and maybe just rough ballparks of sort of how we think about 2022, 2023, 2024?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, Josh. A few of them are a function of time as our acquisitions mature. And then, the wild card obviously is how much COVID will persist into 2022. And so I'll turn it to Mark to give you an accounting of how we see the $6 emerging overtime. Mark?
Mark Keim: Hey, Josh. It's Mark. Just a reminder on the $6, its $3 of COVID $1 of Medicare risk scores and as Joe mentioned $2 of the M&A. So let me add a little color to each one of them. On the Medicare risk scores we should see that $1 next year. Our team can get out there has gotten out there in a meaningful way to produce that $1 next year. So we feel good about that one. On the M&A there's $2. We think about that $2 in two categories. The deals that are already in our P&L probably have another $1 of upside to get to the target margins. That's Magellan Kentucky stuff like that. The other dollar is deals that we've announced or in the case of Affinity just closed but they're not in our P&L yet. About half of that dollar, we should get in the first year -- next year and the other half thereafter. So that's some expectation on the M&A. So then, you're back to the net effect of COVID. And that's the wildcard a bunch of drivers there. Sitting here at the end of October, I don't know that we're ready to give a view on how COVID progresses through 2022. But there's, a couple of things you can think about there. Part of the $3 is in our Marketplace business. And we've had some headwinds this year. We've clearly priced for those headwinds next year. So, we should see some reversal on that within the $3. The rest is going to be a function of what does the pandemic actually do? Do we have another variant? What is the non-COVID utilization and of course the corridors. Everything we know about the corridor so far is quite positive. We have several states -- four states that have terminated the corridors for next year and many that haven't given a formal view yet, but it looks very encouraging. So, a number of drivers around that $3 will we see some of it? I'm pretty sure. But I think it's just a little early to hazard a guess on how much.
Josh Raskin: Perfectly fair. And just one quick follow-up on the risk adjusters. I know you said you're feeling good. I think in your prepared remarks Mark you actually mentioned that you're seeing some benefit already from risk adjuster improvement. And I was curious how does that happen intra-year?
Mark Keim: In Medicare?
Josh Raskin: Yes.
Mark Keim: In particular a couple of things. So, CMS actually extended the window for risk adjustment submission this year which gave everyone the ability to get more work done and more adjustment in. So, that's certainly a good guy. The other thing in Illinois. Illinois expanded their MMP coverage to the full state. They were just a few regions before. So we went in and picked up a number of new members who are coming in really positive on a risk adjustment basis. So two nice drivers for us there.
Josh Raskin: Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Stephen Baxter: Hi thanks. I wanted to ask about the exchanges in your comments on refocusing on the silver plans. It does look to us like you might be pulling back somewhat on the bronze offering in some states. If that's right I would love to understand the thinking there and why you think pulling back versus repricing is the right approach? And just as you think about the comments around maybe flat to down enrollment for next year how much of your exchange book today is coming from products that you will offer next year? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Sure. Yes our repositioning of the product portfolio is really a function of the enhanced subsidies. We can move and our brokers can move members from bronze to silver at zero premium and high subsidies with no additional cost to the member and they get a plan with a higher actuarial value. So, it's better for the member. From our perspective, silver is more flexible and easier to manage. It's easier to develop risk scores and there's more pricing flexibility in silver. So, we're going to emphasize more silver next year than we did this year. Our bronze/silver mix is about 55-45 this year and will be more skewed to silver next year. So that's sort of our mix currently. Clearly, the special enrollment period was another headwind this year. And with the change in the rules that now people eligible -- people that will be eligible are only below 150% of federal poverty means that the membership flows some special enrollment in the industry should be a lot lower. In our case, we estimate about half of what they were this year. We added 200,000 members in special enrollment this year. And with the cutoff at 150% of FPL that's likely to be at least cut half. So, we're forecasting that our membership will be flat to down off the 719,000 this year which means revenue will probably be flat to down. But no matter where revenue lands, it's going to be earnings accretive in 2022. We are very confident in hitting our mid-single-digit pretax margin target next year even on a membership base that's likely to be lower than this year.
Stephen Baxter: Got it. And just as a follow-up to last one. I guess I assume that when you make comments about mid-single-digits that doesn't require the impact of COVID to go to zero. It doesn't require you to necessarily get back that entire 500 basis points. I'd love just to kind of hear about your thought process on how much of that you could continue to tolerate and still achieve the margins? Thank you.
Mark Keim: On that clearly we're carrying 500 of COVID this year. I'm not going to get into our specific pricing assumptions but we clearly anticipate more of that headwind next year as well as just a little bit of what Joe mentioned about on the SEP, but we're pricing in a manner to hit that mid-single-digit pretax.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Hall from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Michael Hall: Hey, thank you guys. So, just a quick question on the 2022 embedded earnings. More of a clarification. It sounds like you mentioned greater than $6 EPS, which it feels like a little bit of an increase in prior activity, which may be coming from pending acquisition margins now well in excess of $2. Is that true? And are you guys seeing better margin performance on acquisitions?
Joe Zubretsky: I think, I'll turn it over to Mark, but yes as we add the acquisitions they're going to be accretive. We're buying them very efficiently. Many of these properties are underperforming. Our integration teams are hitting if not exceeding our accretion targets. So as we add these acquisitions they're going to be accretive. We wouldn't do them if they aren't. But yes, the AgeWell acquisition now that affinity is in the fold has served to sort of increase our forward look on embedded earnings. We still say it's $6 plus. And again how much of that emerges next year and into 2023. We'll wait until we give specific guidance on 2022 in February.
Michael Hall: Got it. And just one more question if I can. On exchanges it sounds like back in your Investor Day you picked up 50,000 lives in line in August. It looks like you gained another 30,000 on top. Could you talk about what you're kind of seeing with special on loan period now having ended? And then just typical exchange attrition with the premium tax credit and maybe some membership recapture from redeterminations do you anticipate at some point returning back to normal attrition level?
Joe Zubretsky: Well, the special enrollment period ended in August. We believe that we'll see attrition between now and the end of the year. It will likely be lower than it was pre-pandemic, but we have 719,000 members now. We'll lose some and probably end the year maybe slightly below 700,000.
Mark Keim: And remember normal attrition for us is about 2% a month. As Joe mentioned this should be a little bit less than that going through the rest of the year, but I think that's a fair outlook.
Operator: The next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Justin Lake: Thanks. A couple of questions. First, can you talk a little bit about the difference in COVID spread for the exchanges versus Medicaid. Obviously you've given a lot on the exchanges, but we think these membership populations is somewhat fungible I guess outside of the duals. But is -- I'm curious why you think that the exchange population is such have to be COVID cause versus the Medicaid population really not being there? And then my second question is just on California Medicaid with the potential we're going to see an RFP here soon. I was hoping you can give us a little bit of an update. I know on your business there in terms of -- I know -- I think you have some business that's direct and then some that's partnered. And how you think this RFP is going to shake out in terms of what the state is looking for? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Sure. Justin on the marketplace and the COVID impacts there are really two factors. One is geography. Our marketplace business just happens to be in places that were hit hard particularly by the Delta variant Florida, Texas, California, Washington. So it follows the geography and follows our Marketplace footprint. The second, we believe is our marketplace population skews younger. Unvaccinated people that are being infected, but the cost of care on an episode basis is actually a bit lower. But the infection rate is high and the younger population that tends to be unvaccinated. So those are the two factors that we cite that seems to disproportionately affect our Marketplace business. On the California RFP, we believe we're very, very optimistic about our ability not only to hold on the business we have but to grow it. As you know we're very strong in L.A. We're very strong at Sacramento and San Diego. We have a nice business in the Inland Empire. We have a great reputation with the state. We perform well. We do all the hard work we need to do with respect to community involvement and charitable giving. We're in really good shape for the California RFP which supposedly at least the latest announcement will come in early 2022 for a contract date for 1/1/24. So we're in good shape in California. We're very optimistic about our prospects not only to maintain what we have but to grow.
Operator: The next question comes from Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Steven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So with the list of action items you're taking to get the Marketplace MLR and the pre-tax margins back on track for 2022 versus 2021, among those pricing probably is the biggest lever. But for the other ones you mentioned, such as, just redesigning the plan offerings and the more restrictive eligibility rules is there any color just on the range of how much those might move the needle on margins? Like could those move margins in the hundreds of basis points, or is it mainly really about the pricing to move your margins by let's call it 500 basis points or so in 2022 versus 2021 in the Marketplace business? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: A little bit of both. I mean, we priced to a medical cost trend in Marketplace that was somewhat reflective of the increased baseline that we experienced this year impacted by COVID. Second, so we priced to an increased medical cost trend. Second, the special enrollment members were experiencing a loss ratio in the mid-90s. And if that membership – some of that membership will renew, some of it will go away. And then of course, next year, the special enrollment period will be targeted at folks with 150% of federal property level incomes are down. So we believe that, the special enrollment period membership will be half or less than half of what it was this year. So all of those factors combined put us in really good shape and producing our mid-single-digit pre-tax margin target for next year, but as I said, likely on membership that is flat to down over 2021.
Mark Keim: And the only thing, I'd add there Steven is, with a big focus on margin rather than membership, we'll have a much higher component in our book of renewals. And the way risk adjustment works is we get much better scores on those renewals, once we've lived with the member for a year or two. So we derive better risk adjustment revenue, and certainly more confidence in the outlook of that revenue.
Steven Valiquette: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Two quick questions. One sort of talk around it on the Marketplace, but a lot of people came on board this year. You said and others have said it, during the extended SEP and it sounds like there may have been some adverse selection there. Do you think these people will re-up next year? Are you assuming the aggregate enrollment on the exchanges is actually down because some of these people won't renew proactively? And then my other question was I know you said, you're up 300 basis points sequentially in non-COVID utilization in marketplace. Can you comment on where you are in the non-COVID utilization relative to 2019 or pre-pandemic or baseline whatever you want to do? And Medicaid, Medicare and I guess even that basis in Marketplace, if you don't mind?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure. I'll try to parse through the various questions. On the first one, we did assume in our pricing that some of the SEP membership would renew, and therefore increased the cost trend that we included in pricing to accommodate that. Now, how many actually do renew and how many just joined because of an episodic health care condition and will leave, we'll have to wait and see. But we did price as though some of those renewal members – some of those SEP members would renew, and we think we've captured that in the medical cost trend we've included in our pricing.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Kevin Fischbeck: Hi. Great. Thanks. I just wanted to go back to $3 COVID impact. I just – I've heard a lot of companies initially sized the COVID Impact number, and then slowly walk back kind of how we should expect it to come back or when we should expect it to come back or almost, if we should expect it to come back. And I just wanted to hear how you guys are thinking. It sounds like the Medicare risk assessment number is relatively clear, but I just want to make sure there's no issues about reinvesting some of that or something like that, so that the net number might be lower. And then, if we should expect you guys to continue to kind of that number for us as we head into next year, and give us an update on where we are versus that $3 number, or does that just get hard to do and you're not going to be breaking that out for us?
Joe Zubretsky: It's – I'll answer the first part of that Kevin, and then I'll turn it to Mark. It's really difficult, because even though our COVID results quarter-to-quarter costing us $77 million and $1 per share seem like it was stable. The stories are quite different. In the second quarter the COVID direct cost of care were less than $100 million and it's twice that in the third quarter. And what ends up happening is when the COVID infection rates are really, really high and it's really intense, you get this counterbalancing impact of utilization curtailment. People fear of contagion of going in for services, hospitals and treating these COVID patients and can't accept discretionary and elective procedures and the like. So the third quarter, actually was one of our highest quarters, if not the highest quarter for the COVID, the direct cost of COVID-related care, but significantly offset with utilization curtailment. And then the corridors the risk-sharing quarters just kind of title through on a very stable basis. It's going to follow the infection rate, which makes it very hard to forecast. As we sit here today, we hope that Delta variant is over. We hope there are no additional variant, but we just don't know that yet. And so as we get closer to February, when we announce our fourth quarter results, we'll probably have a better handle. We will have a better handle on what we think COVID will do in 2022 and we'll announce it then. But the quarter-to-quarter results seem stable on a net basis, but the components are quite volatile, and it just follows the infection rate.
Mark Keim: And just to build on that Kevin, then what you have within what we call the net effect of COVID is the curtailment and the direct cost of COVID that Joe talked about. As a company, those two have worked in tandem so far, but you'll have to take a view on that next year on how this COVID evolved. And do we continue to see curtailment as the offset to that. We all need to take a view on that going into the new year. And then lastly on corridors, that is a component of our total net effect of COVID as well. As I mentioned earlier, we're optimistic that many states have already announced they won't have corridors in the new year, but how much of a continued drag will we have in some of the other states, remains to be seen but we're optimistic on that one. So that was $3 of the embedded earnings around the net effect of COVID. $1 you mentioned, on Medicare risk adjustment. As I mentioned, we continue to be very, very positive on the development of that $1. Remember, the pieces that we gave, aren't guidance. They're embedded earnings, which along with other headwinds or tailwinds can emerge. Medicare is looking pretty good. We'll see that dollar emerge, but don't forget we'll have things like sequestration next year and a few other factors that could add additional headwinds and tailwinds, but we feel good about that dollar.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead.
Scott Fidel: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Interested if you can give us some of your initial observations on how the 2022 Medicare AEP is progressing so far? And just interested in particular with a bunch of those new non-DSNP products that you rolled out for 2022, how those seem to be resonating in the market?
Joe Zubretsky: We think we're in good shape for growth next year. We're not giving a growth expectation on Medicare at this stage. But you're absolutely right, we launched some traditional Medicare Advantage products in some of our DSNP footprint to capture folks who had incomes that didn't allow them to be eligible for DSNP but were low income, using the same network, the same facilities and access to the same type of brokers who operate in those various areas. So, we're really optimistic about our growth prospects as we launched our MAPD products to low-income individuals and our expanded DSNP footprint and additional penetration in our existing footprint. We still do not have the market share that we think we can ultimately obtain in our DSNP footprint. So we're really bullish on the prospects during AEP this year, bearing in mind that we do get to enroll certain people throughout the year as well.
Scott Fidel: Got it. And then just as a follow-up, just interested if we can go back to the Marketplace, and just how you're thinking about the overall market environment for 2022, now that we have all the landscape data out, et cetera. I mean we can certainly see that your pricing is firm certainly relative to the market, as you've been talking about looking to regain margin. Clearly, from the market overall, a lot more issuers right in the market. Benchmark premiums are lower again next year. So, just interested in how you're thinking about the competitive environment and sort of the level of rationality for the marketplace next year? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, Scott. Our strategy is somewhat different than many of our competitors' strategies. What we're targeting are the working poor. We leverage our Medicaid network. We leverage our Medicaid network pricing, and our target market is fully or highly subsidized members. We are not targeting the mass affluent. That's number one. Number two, we did price this year to make sure that we hit our target margins of mid single-digit pre-tax. The way we look at this business is the revenue is going to float up and down with a fixed target margin at mid single digits. We will price for mid single-digit margins, and we'll let the revenue float up and down. The marketplace is a residual market. It flexes up and down with Medicaid eligibility. It's 15 million members nationally strong. We're in great shape in the markets that we choose to play in and our target market is somewhat different than the target markets for many of these new competitors. So, wherever revenue and membership plans for next year, it will be earnings accretive in 2022.
Operator: The next question comes from David Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Windley: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Joe, I wanted to just kind of marry a couple of 4% together. Your -- in your Investor Day, you talked about in your long-term growth expectations for Medicaid kind of 4% growth on the like-for-like base presuming -- I don't think you talked in detail, but presuming some of that enrollment some of that's a little bit of rate. When we look at your assumptions around retention of the redetermination, you're kind of assuming the 375 on your base at the beginning of the pandemic. Also works out to be about 4% per year growth if the pandemic weren't to have happened. I guess, I'm wondering if the elevated retention of these pandemic lives, the redetermination lives is not a little bit of a pull forward on the future or a double dip. And just wondering if you could elaborate on your thoughts around the ability to continue to grow the base 4% even if you retain this higher level of redetermined lives.
Mark Keim: Hey, it's Mark. I'll take that one. So, you're right. On Medicaid, we talked about the base growing at 4%, which is as you mentioned probably half and half between rate and membership growth. That's the market continuing to grow. Now what we stacked on top of that was the headwinds of redetermination. Joe talked through earlier how that was $0.5 billion in 2022 and another 800 million in 2023. So your question gets back to, does that dampen the 2% membership growth? I think it's where you're going. And we don't think it does, because at the end of the day the pool of Medicaid eligible population continues to grow. So yes, you have redetermination, which is addressing people over the last two years, which maybe have lost eligibility. But if the overall pool is growing and we believe it is, we showed a chart at Investor Day that shows every time the country goes through a crisis of one kind or another, these Medicaid roles increase, but they don't go back to where they were. They're sticky at maybe half the growth quite frequently. So we think that overall pool is growing. So we'll have a little bit of a headwind of people from the past losing eligibility, but the pool of new folks coming in and newly eligible continues to grow. So, we feel pretty confident in that outlook.
Joe Zubretsky: David I always say that whether redetermination is a headwind or a tailwind depends on where you're measuring it from. We like to think of it as a value creator, because we measure it from pre-pandemic. The Medicaid roles will be higher post pandemic that may work pre even though year-over-year there might be some choppiness.
David Windley: Got it. Thanks. And just one more question on non-COVID utilization. Are you seeing signs of changing acuity as non-COVID utilization comes back? It's not a topic that's gotten discussed very much.
Joe Zubretsky: No. We -- in many of our markets and in many of our products, it appears to be business as usual, particularly as the Delta variant started to dissipate in late September into October. In August, the Delta variant was really intense and August utilization was very high and we saw some curtailment there. But again, it flexes up and down -- almost routinely flexes up and down with the intensity of COVID infection rate. So in many of our states and many of our products, the curtailment is no longer, but it flexes up and down with the COVID infection rate.
David Windley: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Gary Taylor from Cowen. Please go ahead.
Gary Taylor: Hi, good morning. Just a couple of quick questions. As you were talking about 2022, you laid out some nice potential tailwinds. Wondering if there's anything notable on the headwind side to talk about now? I know you suggested COVID's obviously an unknown. You talked about a couple pharmacy carve-outs that I wouldn't imagine are material to earnings. Otherwise, you would have mentioned it, but any notable potential headwinds we should be thinking about as we're updating models?
Joe Zubretsky: No, I think -- yeah, I would say we've made some judgments around redetermination. Certainly, how much COVID persists into next year that you've identified and then there's just the puts and takes of managed care. Are you capturing -- are you managing medical cost to your trend. But I can't think of an event-driven -- a headwind that is kind of event driven or situationally driven. Just managing managed care, but we have a proven ability to always manage our medical costs to the trend that is embedded in our products and the pricing of our products. So we're pretty comfortable that 2022 could shape up to be a very attractive year for us.
Gary Taylor: Thanks. And then my other question would just be how do we think about the roll-off of the COVID risk corridors impacting seasonality of margins and earnings in 2022? Should we think the earnings become a little more back-end loaded than perhaps they had been pre-COVID?
Joe Zubretsky: Well, four states have eliminated them. Many of the states that are on January one rating cycles have not yet declared whether they will continue them or not. The only one that actually is formally continued into next year is in Mississippi. So it's hard to say. As they're announced either to be eliminated or to persist and whether they persist for a full-year or half year is just largely unknown at this time. So I think your point, is a correct one. It -- whatever happens we'll likely expect our quarter-to-quarter results next year. Whether it's back-ended or front-end loaded, I don't know yet, but the only corridor that actually has been announced that persists into 2022 because their state fiscal year straddles the calendar year is Mississippi.
Gary Taylor: Okay. Thanks, Joe.
Operator: And our last question comes from Mike Newshel from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Mike Newshel: Thanks. So you talked about the adverse selection especially in rolling period this year. Are you worried at all that you might see some similar adverse selection maybe to a lesser degree from the monthly special moment periods for low incomes? And I guess, in the same vein for the Medicaid lives subject to redetermination that you mentioned, would you expect differences in the acuity and margin profile of the half you expect to keep versus the half it goes? 
Joe Zubretsky: No. On the Medicaid, I'll answer the Medicaid question, first. On the Medicaid side we're pretty comfortable that wherever membership goes, how much reduced membership there is because of redetermination, the margins that we're experiencing on the population should be thought of as our portfolio averages. There's actually very little evidence that the acuity of the population shifted all that much. And if it did, some of the states enacted retroactive acuity adjustments that are already embedded in our earnings and then of course, there's the corridors where any favorable experience is given back through the corridor and not through your rates. So we're pretty comfortable saying when you think about membership increases and decreases in Medicaid, due to redetermination we think of it in terms of portfolio averages. On the Marketplace side, we really increased the trend we embedded in the pricing of our product, which I think is demonstrated through some of the filings, you've seen where we really tried to capture not only the higher baseline due to COVID but the higher acuity on what we are experiencing very early in the special enrollment process. And that coupled with the fact that we should have fewer members coming into our membership roles in special enrollment next year. Again gives us great confidence that that mid-single-digit pre-tax margin is attainable. Operator?
Operator: There are no more questions in the queue. This concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-29 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Molina Healthcare Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Trudell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Julie Trudell: Good morning and welcome to Molina Healthcare's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our second quarter earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in our earnings release. For those who are listening to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that remarks made herein are as of today, Thursday, July 29, 2021 and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our second quarter 2021 press release. During our call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, statements regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, the current environment, recent acquisitions, 2021 guidance, our embedded earnings power, and our longer term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report for the 2020 year filed with the SEC as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and our Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to take your questions. Lastly, we want to invite you to attend our Virtual 2021 Investor Day meeting scheduled for Friday, September 17th, where we will share more about our future growth plans and longer term strategy. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?
Joe Zubretsky: Thank you, Julie and good morning. Today, we will provide you with updates on several topics. We will present our financial results for the second quarter 2021, we will update our 2021 guidance, and we will summarize the status of our growth initiatives and outlook for the future. Let me start with the second quarter highlights. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of $3.40 with adjusted net income of $199 million and premium revenue of $6.6 billion. The 88.4% medical care ratio demonstrates solid performance while managing through pandemic-related medical cost challenges that increased the ratio by 110 basis points. The net effect of COVID decreased net income per diluted share by approximately $1. We managed to a 6.9% adjusted G&A ratio reflecting continued discipline in cost management which allowed us to harvest the benefits of scale produced by our substantial growth. We produced an adjusted after-tax margin of 2.9% meeting our second quarter expectations. Our six-month year-to-date performance highlighted by an 87.6% MCR, a 7% adjusted G&A ratio, and a 3.4% after-tax margin were all squarely in line with our year-to-date expectations. This allowed us to produce as projected 60% of our full year earnings guidance in the first half of the year. And we accomplished all of this as we generated approximately 50% year-over-year premium revenue growth and successfully integrated businesses, representing approximately $5 billion in annual revenue. In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter performance. We executed well, delivered solid operating earnings, and continue to drive our growth strategy. Let me provide some commentary highlighting our second quarter performance. First, I note that year-over-year comparisons are less meaningful than they would be in a typical year. The second quarter of last year was the first full quarter of the COVID pandemic and was distorted by the significant positive net effect of COVID that characterized that early phase of the crisis. In contrast, the current quarter was negatively impacted by the net effect of COVID. As a result, sequential comparisons are the more meaningful reflection of underlying business performance and will be the focus of our comments this morning. In the second quarter, we produced premium revenue of $6.6 billion, a 4% increase over the first quarter of 2021, reflecting increased membership across our portfolio. We ended the quarter with approximately 4.7 million members, an increase of 91,000 members over the first quarter of 2021. Our Medicaid enrollment at the end of the quarter was approximately 3.9 million members, an increase of 69,000 over the first quarter of 2021. This increase was due primarily to the continuing suspension of Medicaid redeterminations, although this growth catalyst seems to have moderated. Our Medicare membership was 130,000 at the end of the quarter, an increase of 4,000 and in line with our growth plan. Our Marketplace membership were 638,000 at the end of the quarter, representing growth of 18,000 over the first quarter of 2021 due to lower-than-expected attrition rates and membership additions during the extended open enrollment period. Turning now to our medical margin performance in the second quarter by line of business. Our Medicaid business achieved a medical care ratio of 89%. While we are dealing with the impacts of the pandemic on utilization and medical cost as well as the continuing temporary impact of the risk corridors, we continue to execute on the underlying fundamentals. Our well-diversified portfolio of state contracts across all dimensions of the Medicaid product suite is performing well. We continue to deliver high-quality care at a reasonable cost particularly to high acuity populations. The underlying rate environment is stable. Our hallmark medical management capabilities continue to deliver appropriate clinical outcomes for our members while achieving strong financial results. Our Medicare results were excellent having posted a medical care ratio of 87.6%. We continue to produce excellent MCRs and margins in this portfolio of high-acuity lives in both our D-SNP product and the MMP programs. Although our results were moderately depressed due to COVID utilization and despite the temporary risk score softness for the current year, the underlying results were squarely in line with our expectations. Our Marketplace results have been significantly impacted by direct cost of COVID-related care, as we posted a medical care ratio of 84.8% in the quarter. Many of the new members we attracted were in regions disproportionately affected by COVID including California, Michigan, Texas and Washington. With nearly 500 basis points of pressure on the MCR in each of the first two quarters, we can and should achieve mid-single-digit pretax margins as the pandemic subsides. In short, our second quarter and first half results across the entire portfolio continue to demonstrate our ability to produce excellent margins while growing top line revenue and successfully managing through the ongoing clinical and financial impacts of the pandemic. Turning to our 2021 guidance, beginning with premium revenue. For 2021, we now project premium revenue to be more than $25 billion, a 37% increase over the full year 2020 and a $1 billion increase from our previous guidance. Specifically, our premium revenue guidance now includes Medicaid enrollment benefiting from the expected extension of the public health emergency period and the associated pause on membership redeterminations, which we are now projecting through the end of the fourth quarter. Recall that for each month the public health emergency has extended beyond the month of September, it increases our full year revenue outlook by $150 million. Our updated guidance also contemplates the impact from retaining pharmacy-related premium revenue in California, New York and Kentucky due to postponement of and changes to their respective pharmacy carve-out initiatives and updated Marketplace revenue reflecting the strong enrollment and retention performance mentioned previously. We expect to end 2021 with approximately 590,000 marketplace members. We have excluded from our premium revenue guidance any impact of the Affinity and Cigna acquisitions. We expect the Affinity acquisition to close in the fourth quarter, representing upside to our premium revenue guidance in 2021 and we expect the Cigna acquisition to close in January 2022. Turning now to earnings guidance. We are raising our full year 2021 earnings guidance and now expect to end the year with adjusted earnings of no less than $13.25 per share, an increase from our prior guidance of no less than $13 per share. We remain on track for full year after-tax margins of at least 3%. Specifically, the increase to our 2021 earnings guidance reflects our underlying outperformance, the increase in our revenue guidance and the associated margin, offset by a $1 increase in the net cost of COVID, which we now expect to be $2.50 per share for the full year. We have been cautious in projecting our back half earnings due to a variety of exogenous factors. The Delta variant adds variability to any utilization forecast. While highly contagious, the Delta variant disproportionately affects the unvaccinated. Older and more vulnerable population cohorts have significantly higher vaccination rates. As a result, the Delta variant cases result in proportionately fewer hospital admissions and lower per admission costs, moderating the potential impact. In addition, it remains unknown how quickly and to what extent utilization will return to normal levels. This will depend upon the strength of the economy, consumer behavior provider capacity and the emergence of any new COVID variants. There is an inherent level of uncertainty with regard to new marketplace member acuity levels and their susceptibility to COVID infection and the COVID-related risk-sharing corridors create an added element of variability. Turning now to an update on our growth initiatives. We continue to see many actionable opportunities in our acquisition pipeline, which remains an important aspect of our growth strategy. Our M&A team is fully deployed and is working an active list of health plan targets in our core businesses. Our acquisition strategy remains focused on buying stable membership and revenue streams, particularly focused on underperforming properties. Our M&A integration team is also fully deployed and successfully migrating our acquired properties to Molina operating infrastructure and cost structure, to ensure we deliver the earnings accretion we expected. To-date, we are on track to meet or exceed our earnings accretion commitments. We continue to pursue to new Medicaid procurement opportunities. We have contract winning capabilities, an aggressive in-state ground game and a winning proposal writing platform. We are confident that we will continue to win new contracts that will contribute to our growth trajectory in 2022 and 2023. Finally, some comments about the longer-term outlook for our business. The current rate environment is stable and rational. We now have confirmed data points to support the continued belief that the Medicaid risk sharing corridors related to the declared public health emergency will be eliminated, as the COVID pandemic subsides. Pandemic-related corridors have already been eliminated for the 2022 state fiscal years in California, New York, South Carolina and Michigan, with momentum towards similar outcomes in other states. The current Medicare risk score shortfall phenomenon is temporary, as our 2022 bids did fully account for the current assessment of next year's risk scores. We continue to be bullish about the performance of our acquired businesses. The operational integrations are proceeding as or better than planned and we have high confidence in achieving our original accretion estimates and possibly, even exceeding them. In the context of the pandemic subsiding and our acquisitions maturing, the incremental embedded earnings power of the business, as it exists today, is meaningful. With the increased outlook for the net negative effect of COVID, our incremental embedded earnings power is now more at $5 above our 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance. In short, our pro forma run rate, after the natural relaxation of these temporary constraints, would produce adjusted earnings per share comfortably in the mid-teens and an after-tax margin of approximately 4%. I look forward to sharing more about our future growth plans and longer-term strategy at our Investor Day on September 17. At our Investor Day, we will provide you with an initial 2022 revenue outlook. We will also provide you with an updated view of our long-term targets, for revenue growth for our three lines of business, operating metrics for our three lines of business and enterprise margin, net income and earnings per share expectations. And, as importantly, as has been our hallmark style, we will provide you with our detailed playbook for achieving those results. We will continue not just to declare our goals, but to show you the transparency and specificity, how we will achieve them. Suffice it to say, we are an inherently high-growth businesses and have demonstrated an ability to grow the top line and maintain an attractive margin profile, even during a global pandemic. The political, legislative and regulatory environments are all positive catalysts and the social demographic profile of the U.S. population remains in significant need of the social safety net we manage. As I conclude my remarks, I want to express my gratitude to our management team and our nearly 13,000 Molina colleagues. Their skill dedication and steadfast service, continue to form the foundation, for everything we have achieved and everything we will achieve in the years to come. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Keim, for some additional color on the financials. Mark?
Mark Keim: Thank you, Joe. This morning, I will discuss some additional details of our second quarter performance, and then turn to our growth strategy, the balance sheet and some thoughts on our 2021 guidance. Beginning with some detailed commentary about our second quarter results. The net effect of COVID, negatively impacted second quarter results by $77 million or approximately $1 a share. This increased the second quarter MCR by 110 basis points to 88.4%. The impact was higher than our expectations and negatively affected all three lines of business. We experienced high COVID-related inpatient costs early in the quarter, which tapered off as the quarter progressed. We also saw increases in professional and outpatient costs, which we attribute to what, may be the return to normal pre-COVID utilization patterns. In Medicaid, the net effect of COVID was a cost of approximately $25 million and accounted for a 40 basis point increase that is included within our reported 89% MCR. The first quarter Medicaid MCR had a 150-basis-point benefit due to COVID, which substantially explains the sequential increase in MCR. We continue to expect the full year Medicaid MCR to be in the high 80s. In Medicare, the net effect of COVID was a cost of approximately $17 million, increasing the MCR by 200 basis points to 87.6% in the quarter. The first quarter Medicare MCR was increased by 400 basis points due to COVID. Sequentially, the MCR improved, driven by this lower net effect of COVID and improved underlying performance compared to the first quarter. We anticipate a full year Medicare MCR in the high 80s. In Marketplace, the net effect of COVID was a cost of approximately $35 million, increasing the MCR by 480 basis points. The first quarter Marketplace MCR included a similar impact from the net effect of COVID, which increased the first quarter MCR by approximately 500 basis points. The resulting sequential increase in MCR versus the first quarter reflects the normal seasonality associated with members reaching their policy deductible limits. Due to the higher-than-expected impact from the net effect of COVID in the first half of the year, we now expect Marketplace pretax margins to moderate to low single digits. We expect that when the COVID pandemic subsides, our Marketplace pretax margin will be squarely on target, with our mid-single-digit pretax margin expectations. Turning now to our balance sheet. We received $145 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, which brought our parent company cash balance to $564 million at the end of the quarter. We have ample capacity to fund the announced acquisitions. At our current margins, we generate significant excess cash and additional debt capacity. After funding our announced pending acquisitions, we will have year-end acquisition capacity of over $1.4 billion. At the multiples we have paid in recent transactions, this gives us the ability to drive $3 billion to $4 billion in annualized revenue growth. More importantly, at our current level of performance, this level of acquisition capacity is generated each year. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and our reserve position remains strong. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter represented 48 days of medical cost expense, unchanged from the first quarter. Prior year reserve development in the second quarter of 2021 was modestly favorable, but any P&L impact was mostly absorbed by the COVID-related risk corridors. Debt at the end of the quarter is 2.2 times trailing 12-month EBITDA. Our debt-to-cap ratio was 50%. However, on a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.7 times and 43% respectively. These metrics reflect a conservative leverage position. A few additional comments, related to our earnings guidance. We raised full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance to be no less than $13.25 per share, which reflects the following. Our underlying outperformance, an increase in our revenue guidance and the associated margin, the net effect of COVID expectations which has increased by $1 per share and is now expected to be approximately $2.50 per share for the full year, and continued caution in forecasting utilization trends in the remaining six months of the year due to the COVID pandemic. In a typical year, the seasonality of utilization and timing of open enrollment periods resulted in third quarter earnings being higher, than fourth quarter earnings. However this year, we expect second half earnings to be distributed more evenly between the quarters, due to the net effect of COVID and particularly the impact of risk sharing corridors. As Joe discussed, we believe the incremental embedded earnings power of the company is in excess of $5. This is composed of several items. The increased net effect of COVID, which is now expected to create a $2.50 per share decrease, that should dissipate as the pandemic subsides. Medicare risk score disruption that created approximately $1 a share overhang; and as we obtain our target margins on Magellan Complete Care and Kentucky, and once Affinity and Cigna acquisitions are closed and synergized, we expect to achieve additional adjusted earnings per share of at least $2. This embedded earnings power does not represent 2022 guidance, but rather an accounting of the dynamic impacts that are temporarily depressing our earnings profile. There are many other items that will affect our actual earnings guidance for 2022 including several possible scenarios for the impact of Medicaid membership redeterminations. In short, our 2021 earnings jump-off point into 2022 is very strong. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead Kevin.
Kevin Fischbeck: All right, great. Thanks. I wanted to maybe just dig into that last comment about the earnings power. And I guess your point about potential offset from redeterminations. Is there any framework that you guys have that you think would be helpful to think about how much redeterminations is adding to this base number, and how to think about the timing of when that might roll off?
Joe Zubretsky: Kevin this is Joe. Over the net last number of months, we have formed a view of what's going to happen with the suspension of the redetermination pause. And the way we now characterize it, we believe that this will be a very organized and orderly approach to move any members that are no longer eligible for Medicaid into the uninsured population or other forms of insurance. Aside three things. One, there is a reasonable possibility that the federal government actually extends the public health emergency. Second, many states are actually applying for types of waivers to manage their populations in different ways. Illinois has suggested to CMS that they want to continue the public health emergency for another year. New Jersey wants to redetermine its members on their anniversary day. So we believe that this is going to be a very, very orderly transition. Nobody wants to have Medicaid members stranded without coverage. Bearing in mind, we have over 70 million members nationally that need to go through a redetermination process and the states just do not have the capacity to do this in the mandated six-month period of time, which suggests to us that the government and CMS may actually relax that standard and allow for more time to transition these members. So we're looking at this as a protracted, orderly event over 2022 perhaps even into 2023 to make sure that all Medicaid members who are no longer eligible have the opportunity to age into the D-SNP product to income up into a highly subsidized marketplace product or as they obtain work end up in the employer sponsored insurance marketplace. We will provide a variety of scenarios of what that might look like for 2022 at our Investor Day on September 17th.
Kevin Fischbeck: Okay. That's really helpful. I guess maybe just to wrap that up then. How do you think about the margin on that business? I guess in general you would think that anyone redetermined is probably a better risk pool and therefore a little bit higher margin, should we be thinking about it that way, or are there offsets to be considering there?
Joe Zubretsky: There are offsets. There is no question that if you look at medical economic data or actuarial data that generally speaking duration of membership causes acuity to decline, the level of acuity to decline. There's no question about that. The longer they're on the roles, the less acute they are. Two factors as you referenced offsets. One, many states took that into consideration in setting rates. So it's already in the rates that we have a lower acuity population. And second, bear in mind that while the volume won't get picked up by the risk corridors, any excess margin on those members is surely picked up by the risk corridors and 30% of our revenue is already in the 100% tier. So, yes, I would look at -- there is a margin on those members, but the margin is likely no more than a low-single-digit target margin. But we view that as accreting off the books over a very long period of time in a very orderly fashion as I suggested. But I -- the way we look at it is the margin on those members is no greater or less than the average margin of the portfolio.
Kevin Fischbeck: That’s helpful. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Matt Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead Matt.
Matt Borsch: Yes, good morning. Thank you. I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit more about the utilization and medical cost components during the second quarter. Specifically, I'm trying to understand, how the direct cost of COVID, have evolved in Marketplace and Medicaid relative to the non-COVID, if you're able to talk about non-COVID relative to sort of normal baseline? I'm just a little confused on, how much pressure you're getting directly from COVID in particular.
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, Matt. Let me start with what we call just traditional normal utilization of healthcare services. We believe and the data supports it, that the healthcare system is coming back to operating at full capacity, not greater than full capacity and not lower, but at full capacity, which means utilization, all those types of procedures the elective and discretionary procedures wellness visits, preventive care, primary care visits for checkups are all coming back to pre-pandemic levels. In fact, in our forecast, we actually trend off of 2019 medical cost data to make sure, that we appropriately capture pre-pandemic utilization. In our forecast for the entire year, we trended off that full utilization baseline. So we are assuming that the system has reverted back to pre-pandemic levels of utilization, for all those types of services that were either deferred or eliminated during the pandemic. Now with respect to COVID, the situation while similar is actually somewhat different today, than earlier in the pandemic. We are seeing the Delta variant and the Delta variant is affecting the unvaccinated. The unvaccinated tend to be younger and healthier, than folks that were vaccinated. So while we're seeing prevalence of Delta variant COVID infection rates, fewer of those incidents are requiring hospital stays. So much of the care is being provided in an outpatient ambulatory setting. And the cases that do require an admission, the length of stay is shorter. There is a lower incidence of ICU utilization which is expensive and lower utilization of ventilator which suggests lower acuity. So while we're seeing a prevalence of Delta variant COVID-related cases, the severity of those cases is a lot lower than the severity of the cases earlier in the pandemic. During the quarter, we experienced about $95 million of COVID-related direct costs of inpatient care during the quarter, but it really tapered off. It was about $50 million in the first month of the quarter about $30 million in the second and about $15 million or so in the last month of the quarter. We expect that to research. The Delta variant infection rate is popping particularly in states that have low vaccination rates. And in our full year forecast, we have forecasted forward, a continuation of COVID-related cost of care, at a certain level. Hopefully, that's helpful to your analysis.
Matt Borsch : Yeah. It's very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from A.J. Rice from Crédit Suisse. Please go ahead, A.J.
A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi everybody. Maybe just to drill down a little bit on the public exchanges and what you're seeing in the marketplace environment. Is -- it sounds like the costs are running a little bit ahead or somewhat ahead. And it sounds like, a lot of that is COVID related. But can you talk about why that is you think? And also is the demographics of the new enrollees you've seen over the course of this year, different than those that are traditionally been attracted to a Molina public exchange product?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, A.J. The first thing I would say is, the infection rate is very geographically correlated, it's probably the best word to use and so, while we wrote a lot of new membership in Texas, Washington, California, Mississippi where the infection rates are high. So we wrote new business, at the beginning of the pandemic, not knowing and not realizing that pandemic is going to last this long and persist this long. So granted, we wrote new membership purposely wrote to grow, at the early stages of the pandemic and the pandemic has persisted longer than anybody imagined. Second, any product that has an extended enrollment period or a special enrollment period has the aspect of inviting adverse selection. If you can buy insurance anytime you want, you can buy it when you need it. Now we don't think the adverse selection bias in this population was that high, but it's there. And if you're writing with a selection bias into markets that are COVID prone you're going to get COVID cases. And when you strip it all back, a 500 basis points of pressure in each of the first two quarters is the reason we are running in low-single-digit margins and not mid-single digit. And we absolutely believe as the pandemic subsides we'll produce an 80%-ish MCR for the entire year and be squarely in line with those low-single-digit margins and able to lift that into mid-single-digits into 2022.
A.J. Rice: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: The next question comes from Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead, Steven.
Steven Valiquette: Hey, thanks. Good morning everybody. So, I guess just in relation to the Medicaid redeterminations being pushed out. I guess on the one hand you mentioned the incremental $150 million of revenue for every month of extension which I think you also stated several quarters ago. Then you mentioned again today that the impact has moderated somewhat. I think you talked more about a $300 million to $400 million incremental revenue opportunity in the remainder of 2021 last quarter, if it's delayed further. So I guess I wanted to just confirm that within the $1 billion revenue guidance increase for this year how much of it is tied to the redetermination just to triangulate all the numbers? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, I just said in my remarks partially due to redeterminations the Marketplace and the pharmacy carve-outs. I'll turn to Mark to walk you through the bridge. 
Mark Keim: Yes. So on the incremental $1 billion that we're talking about $450 million is the simple math on three additional months of the redetermination 3x $150 million. We've also done better on marketplace as you've seen in our numbers both on OEP and SEP. We've picked up additional members as that market grows. That's probably another $150 million on full year. Then as we mentioned some of the pharmacy carve-outs there were three states: California New York and Kentucky all of which extended any view on carve-outs which gave us about another $400 million. So you put those numbers together that's your $1 billion in upside. 
Operator: Steven does it answer all your questions? Do you have any further questions? 
Steven Valiquette: That's good for me. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, Justin. 
Justin Lake: Thanks, good morning. Appreciate the comments on the RFP pipeline Joe during your prepared remarks. Just hoping you might be able to give us a little more color there in terms of what are some of the key RFPs we might be focused on over the next 12 to 18 months? And then anything on how you think California shapes up? I know that's probably a couple of years out from any kind of decision, but obviously an important state. 
Joe Zubretsky: Sure Justin. Well as I said, we continue to be very bullish on our prospects in these open procurements in new states. And there are a couple of states that we believe Ohio and Michigan which will be putting behavioral and LTSS into managed care sometime in the near future. And those are states where we already have entrenched relationships and feel very good about it. But on the new, new '22 Nevada, Rhode Island, Georgia, Iowa, Tennessee is out there. Now we may or may not bid on all of those. They have to be sequenced appropriately with reprocurement bids and other things we're working on. But those are four to five -- Georgia if I didn't mention it those are the four or five that come to mind over the next three or four years. And based on our track record we feel we have contract winning capabilities a great proposal writing team. And we've really, really amped up our in-state round game building those relationships years and years in advance of the procurement in order to really understand the state program and to have those relationships that are so important to a state contract. Your last part of your question sorry, was California. Look they've announced a year-end dropping of the RFP. We've been working on it in 2022. So we're working on that timeline. But these things have been delayed before. It's the first reprocurement in California I think in over a decade. I'm pretty sure about that. It's a complicated state. Every state as you know has a different managed care model. But we do really, really well in L.A., in Sacramento, in San Diego, the Inland Empire and we have every reason to believe that not only do we have every opportunity to defend our current positions but to actually grow in a few other counties where we currently don't play. 
Justin Lake: Thanks for the color.
Joe Zubretsky: You’re welcome, Justin.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead, Dave.
Dave Windley: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. In your Quantification of the $5 of earnings power I think the last couple of dollars were from fully synergizing acquisitions. I wanted to make sure, I was clear on whether that was just counting those that you've completed, or if you were also including those that you talked about completing at the end of this year and early next year? So that's my first question. 
Joe Zubretsky: Dave there's a little bit of both and I'll kick it to Mark for the actual bridge. 
Mark Keim: Yes. So recall the numbers total around $5.50, $2.50 of that was the net effect of COVID. We talked about the Medicare risk scores. You're pointing to the remaining $2 of M&A upside. Dave that splits evenly between $1 of incremental run rate on MCC in Kentucky. Those are the ones that are already in current year performance. So in their second year, they'll mature to their full run rate that gives you $1. Then, the ones we've announced but not closed, will be in next year's performance that will give you the remaining dollar.
Dave Windley: Got it. And then, Joe you talked about, and I think you really touched on this maybe last time, but talked about the risk corridors going away and that you feel pretty comfortable that that's going to happen. In thinking about, the states kind of heads they win, tails you lose on this that they put the risk corridors in to get money back when you were underspending. But, in the event that the utilization bounces back and your overspending on medical costs they've taken them away, is that -- how do you protect against that risk?
Joe Zubretsky: It's a really good question, because as you know, these risk corridors by rule have to be symmetrical. So anything you potentially give up on the upside, you get on the downside. Look, the targets have been set at a point where as a company our operators, Mark Keim, our Financial Officer, myself don't even think about winning -- getting money back on the downside. It's possible, but we think the -- not we think, we know there's lots of non for profit players that may get checks from the state governments, because they're operating above. We are not operating anywhere near that target, which is why our corridors are substantial. We have some of the highest margins in the industry in many of our states, and therefore whether $1 of outperformance is related to COVID or just skill. You get it back in the corridor, if you're in 100% tier. So, we don't think about being protected on the downside, because we have -- we're not skating that close to the edge at all. And if we were, and that's just a different set of problems that we're not operating in an excellent way, we're nowhere near that territory. So, we're not at all relying on or put value in the upside protection of the corridors.
Dave Windley: Got it. Thanks. And then a quick last one. You talked about the quantification of your buying power for new plans and fairly substantial amount and the ability to regenerate that as your cash flow. Where does your infrastructure stand? Are you making steady investments in infrastructure to be able to onboard that much revenue, or do you face a step function at some point in the next couple of years?
Joe Zubretsky: I'll give you a quick answer and then kick it to Mark, but we have a fully ramped up integration team. And our analysis is we have lots of runway many billions of dollars of revenue to add in our current infrastructure with our current cloud-supported applications, our data centers which are now moving to the cloud. The entire infrastructure physical infrastructure, application infrastructure, all the on-the-shelf applications we use, all have the scalability to take on billions of dollars of additional revenue without hitting a step function. It's a question I've been asked before and one I look at very seriously. There's not a big bang technology redo here because of our acquisition strategy. Our platforms can handle the additional scale.
Dave Windley: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead, Scott.
Scott Fidel: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask a question just on going back to the Marketplace, and just thinking about philosophically how you've approached the pricing strategy for 2022, targeting -- wanted to get to that, mid-single-digit margins that you feel that you have underneath the COVID impacts. But, just interested as we think about how you sort of input it sort of continued COVID impact into next year, potential acuity dynamics relating to the members that came in this year, particularly related to some of the extended Biden SEPs. And then, I guess just game theory to around the competitive environment with some of these newer players in particular, having been more aggressive on some of the pricing strategies. Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Sure. This is a business, the Marketplace business, putting a frame around it. First of all, it's a strategic adjacency to Medicaid. It follows our Medicaid footprint. It leverages our Medicaid network, both in terms of network adequacy and pricing. So it's very much attached to the Medicaid business. The marketplace business will follow the Medicaid footprint. So, strategically it fits. At just over 10% of revenue, it's sort of in line with an adjunct, an adjacency that fits nicely into the portfolio. So we like the position it has. To your point about 2022, you manage this business for margin first and membership later. Because it's a blind bid business, where you're being against competitors not knowing exactly how they're going to bid, you have to be careful. And so, when we established our 2022 bidding strategy, I'll stay away from geographic detail, because I'd be giving away proprietary information, we pretty much used the higher cost baseline that we've been experiencing here early in the year. Now, that means somebody else took a flyer on it and decided that as the pandemic subsides all this cost goes away and they beat us on price fine. We'll give up the member and we'll make sure we have mid-single-digit margins. So in this business, because of the blind bid strategy, because of the inherent movement of members, who will move for price we are pricing for margin over membership, but we believe we will continue to have a very robust and profitable business into next year, but again following our Medicaid footprint. 
Scott Fidel: Got it. Thanks. And then just one follow-up question. Just given some of these unique dynamics particularly relating to the corridors when looking at the balance of PPS that you're expecting over the rest of the year, any insights you're willing to provide us just in terms of how the split may look between 3Q and 4Q?
Mark Keim: Sure. In a typical year, you'd see a little better margin in the third quarter and a little taper off into fourth. In my prepared remarks, what I said is that, we expect to see more of a level dynamic between Q3 and Q4. Partly, it's – the utilization patterns just aren't like what we've seen in a normal year, right? What we've got continuing COVID potentially the Delta variant going into Q3 here. But the other thing is just the leveling effect of these corridors will level out the performance from one quarter to the next. So not quite the normal seasonality you'd expect to see. You might model something a little more level between the quarters.
Scott Fidel: Okay. Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead, Josh.
Josh Raskin: Thanks. Good morning. I want to get back to the sort of scalability question. You look at the quarter and you added $280 million of revenues and G&A was only up $11 million. And I know, typically, we hear about new revenues coming in at less profitable levels and I know a large majority of that's on the MLR line and not necessarily the G&A. But just trying to figure out you guys are now at an industry-leading level. And so how sustainable is that G&A? And do you think there's investments needed in certain areas? And maybe more specifically just where are the – is it cost savings that are coming, or is it really just leverage on new revenues?
Joe Zubretsky: Josh, we continue to be disciplined on the cost line. And when we talk about fixed cost leverage, our hope is not a strategy. You don't hope that it happens you actually manage through it. You bring on the Cigna book of business an additional $1 billion of revenue. We can run it with half the people that we're running it before, because of our presence in Texas. And at the corporate headquarters, you don't need to add more accountant's lawyers and HR people in order to manage the business. So we have a zog and nog strategy in terms of corporate overhead. And when we're bringing on bolt-on and tuck-ins in our existing geographies, we make sure that, we appropriately resource the business to make sure that every member and provider is getting the service they need for that we use local scale and only take on the variable cost to run the business. And Mark and his finance team and the operators are really disciplined about doing that, which is why we've said many, many times and we'll say it again on the 17th that whatever MLR pressure exists in this business, and its managed care, so it always exists, we believe can be overcome, if we're successful in our growth strategy with fixed cost leverage. And we're already starting to drive our SG&A ratio down below 7% on a consolidated basis. It's a lot lower than that in Medicaid. And obviously, Medicare brings it up. Medicare has a mid-teens G&A ratio. So the mix effect will affect that. But we have every intention of driving this ratio, given our growth trajectory down to the 6s.
Josh Raskin: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, Stephen.
Stephen Baxter: Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Just similar to how you broke down the incremental premiums that are included in guidance. It seems like, there's an implied $1.25 of incremental earnings power, when you think about raising the guidance and flagging the extra dollar from COVID. So I was wondering, if you could similar to how you talked about the extra $850 of Medicaid revenues and extra $150 million of exchange premiums inside of that. Any sense of what the extra $125 million breaks down to in terms of the drivers there? That would be helpful. Thanks.
Mark Keim: Sure. I'll take that in a couple of chunks. Obviously, the headwind there was the dollar of incremental net COVID. So offsetting that's $1.25 of upside, right? It's probably broken into two components. I think about $0.80 of that $1.25 just relates to that $1 billion incremental revenue, we talked about. Maybe an additional $0.45, it's just on our underlying performance a little bit in the front half of the year and what we see for the second half of the year. And that's things like our payment integrity programs our UM our CM, and some of that SG&A discipline that Joe was just talking about. So the $0.80 on the $1 billion to $0.45 just our underlying performance that gets you to about $1.25.
Joe Zubretsky: And the point you made is really an important one. Even though the guide is optically only $0.25 higher on, if you want to normalize for COVID, we're adding $1.25 really true earnings performance and margin on revenue, which is a really good trajectory as a jumping off point into 2022.
Stephen Baxter: Thanks. And then just one follow-up on the question Kevin asked before about redeterminations. When you talk about the overall redetermination population, you're not really thinking that's going to carry a different margin than the broader Medicaid book. Are you talking about a gross margin or an operating margin? And I guess how do you think about dealing with SG&A deleveraging potential for that population? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: We did -- I mean we did have to take on additional resources to service the increased population. So it's not as though we leveraged the complete infrastructure and therefore it's only contribution margin it's going to leave we will have some SG&A that we'll be able to depart the company. We took on contract resources. We worked overtime. We added resources in our call centers and our clinical services and those will be able to be relieved when that membership -- when that membership attrits. And again the point I want to make is we're at 680,000 members up organically since the beginning of the pandemic. That number is likely to be 750,000 by the end of the year. It's not going to the zero. The structural level of unemployment particularly in the lower rate service economy that economy was far more stressed than the average economy. The stimulus checks and the unemployment benefits are still out there. And that number is just not going to zero. Now where it lands we don't know, but we believe and it's been proven over 35 years that any time there's been an event usually some type of economic event or a recession where Medicaid enrollment has swelled that -- post event, the membership, the enrollment nationally has stayed at an increased level for years after the crisis has abated. So we're pretty comfortable in saying that 750,000 are likely to be up will not go to zero. Where it lands we don't know but the unemployment rates in many of our states particularly in the low wage service economy are still quite high.
Mark Keim: And the only other thing to sprinkle on top of that is we'll talk more about this at Investor Day, but as that redetermination the revenues from that obviously form a headwind. You talked a little bit about G&A leverage component. But don't forget that will be offset with our growth initiatives our new M&A right? We've got two deals that will affect next year, new procurements and our other organic growth initiatives. So it's still a growing revenue pie and still a very attractive G&A proposition.
Stephen Baxter: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-29 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Molina Healthcare First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. All participants will be in a listen only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Julie Trudell. Please go ahead. 
Julie Trudell: Good morning and welcome to Molina Healthcare's first quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our first quarter earnings was distributed after the market close yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30-days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of the presentation, we remind you that the remarks made herein or as of today, Thursday, April 29, 2021, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our fourth quarter 2021 press release. During our call, we will be making certain Forward-Looking Statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding to the COVID-19 pandemic, the current environment, recent acquisitions, 2021 guidance and our longer-term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report for the 2020 year filed with the SEC, as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and our Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open up the call and take your questions. Lastly, we want to invite you to attend our virtual 2021 investor day meeting scheduled for Friday, September 17, where we will share more about our future growth plan and longer term strategy. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?
Joseph Zubretsky: Thank you, Julie and good morning. Today, we will provide you with updates on several topics. We will cover our financial results for the first quarter 2021. We will update our 2021 guidance in the context of our first quarter results and we will then provide an update on our growth initiatives and outlook for the future. Let me start with first quarter highlights. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of $4.44 with adjusted net income of $260 million and premium revenue of $6.3 billion. Our results for the quarter were strong across many dimensions. The 86.8% MCR demonstrates solid cost management fundamentals particularly in light of some of the challenges presented by the pandemic. We managed to a 7% adjusted G&A ratio as we continue to reinvest the benefits created by our strong enterprise wide fixed cost leverage in our growth initiatives. We produced an adjusted after tax margin of 4% squarely in line with our long term targets in exceeding our first quarter expectations. Our $4.44 adjusted earnings per share in the quarter were a 47% increase over the first quarter of 2020 and we accomplished all of this as we are generating 47% year-over-year premium revenue growth and successfully integrating businesses representing approximately $5 billion in annual revenue. In summary, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance as we executed well, delivered solid operating earnings, and continued to deliver on our growth strategy. Let me provide some commentary highlighting our first quarter performance. Premium revenue was $6.3 billion, a 47% increase over the first quarter of 2020 reflecting increased membership, in line with our expectations in both Medicaid and Medicare and exceeding our expectations in marketplace. We ended the quarter with 4.6 million managed care members, an increase of 573,000 over the fourth quarter 2020. Our Medicaid enrollment at the end of the quarter was 3.9 million members, an increase of 260,000 over the fourth quarter of 2020. This sequential increase was the result of strong organic growth of 63,000 members, as the suspension of redetermination in a slowly recovering economy continued to positively impact Medicaid membership. Although this growth catalyst seems to have moderated and growth of 197,000 members from the acquisition of Magellan Complete Care which closed on December 31. Our Medicare membership was 126,000 at the end of the quarter representing growth of 11,000 over the fourth quarter of 2020 which was primarily related to our acquisitions. Our marketplace membership grew by 302,000 in the quarter to 620,000, exceeding our initial forecast of at least 500,000 members. This growth was driven by several factors; strong product design and competitive pricing, effectuation rates substantially higher than historical averages, lower than expected natural attrition rates, and the extended open and special enrollment periods. Turning now to our medical margin results for the quarter. Our first quarter 2021 MCR was 86.8%, reflecting modest COVID related utilization curtailment, severe winter weather, and the absence of a traditional flu season offset by the direct costs of COVID related care. While the net effect of COVID for the total company was negligible in the quarter in line with our expectations, the impact varied by line of business. Our Medicare and marketplace businesses experienced a disproportionately negative impact from the net effect of COVID exerting pressure on their respective MCRs. This was offset by a modest favorable net COVID impact in Medicaid. Some additional comments on performance by line of business. In the Medicaid business, we achieved an 87.5% medical care ratio for the first quarter performing in line with our expectations. In addition to the external factors mentioned previously, which were unusually favorable in the quarter, the medical care ratio was also supported by our performance and utilization management and payment integrity. A portion of our Medicaid outperformance was recaptured by the risk sharing corridors and impact which was well within our expectations. The corridors are designed such that they will act as a buffer to absorb some of the over and underperformance related to medical margin no matter how that performance is derived. Our Medicare business produced a medical care ratio of 90.3% for the first quarter. The medical care ratio was negatively impacted by higher than expected direct costs of COVID related care and the temporary industry wide challenge of risk score capture, which results in risk scores that do not fully reflect the acuity of the membership. The Medicare business performed as expected when normalized for these two discrete impacts. Finally, our marketplace business experienced a medical care ratio of 77.3% for the first quarter. The medical care ratio was negatively impacted by higher than expected direct costs of COVID related care as the COVID infection rate resurged in many of our marketplace geographies. We did however, achieve our pre-tax earnings target due to the increased membership volume. We continue to effectively manage our resources. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 7%, identical to the 7% reported in the first quarter of 2020. Our performance reflects disciplined cost management and the benefits of fixed costs leverage produced by our substantial growth offset somewhat by the higher than targeted DNA ratios of our acquired businesses which will improve as our integrations progress. We are pleased with our first quarter results as we continue to demonstrate the ability to produce excellent margins while substantially growing top line revenue and managing through the ongoing effects of the pandemic. Turning through our 2021 guidance, beginning with premium revenue. For 2021, we now project premium revenue to be more than $24 billion a 31% increase over the full year 2020 and a $1 billion increase from our previous guidance. Specifically, our premium revenue guidance now includes Medicaid enrollment benefiting from the expected extension of the public health emergency period, and the associated pause on membership redeterminations, which we are now projecting through the end of the third quarter. Recall, we had said that for each month public health emergency is extended beyond the month of May it could increase our full year revenue outlook by $150 million and updated marketplace revenue reflecting the strong enrollment and retention performance mentioned previously. We expect to end 2021 with slightly more than 500,000 marketplace members in marketplace premium revenue growth is now expected to be over 50%. We have excluded from our premium revenue guidance any impact of the affinity and signal acquisitions. We do expect these transactions to close this year representing upside to our premium revenue in 2021. In summary, we are very pleased with our growth trajectory. Our growth is well balanced between a new contract win, organic growth, bolt on acquisitions, benefit expansions in our existing geographies, and greater penetration of our marketplace in Medicare products in our Medicaid footprint. Turning now to earnings guidance. We are raising our full year 2021 adjusted earnings guidance to be no less than $13 per share, an increase from our prior guidance of $12.50 to $13 per share. Specifically, the increase towards 2021 earnings guidance reflects the favorable impacts of the increase in our revenue guidance and the associated margin, the first quarter earnings outperformance, and the combined effect of other individually minor impacts such as the sequestration delay in Medicare. We have however, hedged our guidance due to a variety of exogenous factors. First and foremost, we are still in a pandemic which introduces a level of uncertainty with respect to any healthcare utilization forecast. We have continued to be cautious in forecasting utilization trends in the remaining nine months of the year as the COVID pandemic subsides. How quickly and to what extent utilization rebound will depend upon the strength of the economy, consumer behavior, provider capacity and the level of COVID infection rates. With respect to forecasting, our marketplace utilization trends we recognize there is an inherent level of uncertainty with regard to new member acuity levels which we will monitor closely and the risk sharing corners create an added element of variability. While any individual stake corridor can be a buffer to that state over or underperformance predicting in which states over or underperformance may occur can create an element of forecasting variability. Turning now to an update on our growth initiatives. We are very pleased to have been rewarded our major Medicaid contracts in the state of Ohio. We were awarded contracts in all three regions in the state maintaining our statewide presence. This re-procurement win is a testimony to our excellent service, innovative programs, strong relationships, and our reputation as a business partner that can be counted on. While Ohio did introduce at least one additional player to the statewide program, continuity of care is of the utmost importance to a Medicaid program. As such, we have every reason to believe our current business profile should not materially change. The agreement to acquire Cigna STAR+PLUS membership is yet another example of an accretive, strategic bolt on acquisition. The business serves approximately 50,000 ADB and MMP members across three regions in Texas. Full year 2020 revenue is approximately $1 billion. With a modest purchase price of $60 million, we project the acquisition will deliver returns well in excess of our cost of capital, benefit from local and enterprise operating leverage and will be immediately accretive. The expanded presence in Texas should position us well and the re-procurement should the state proceed with that process. Finally, some comments about the longer term outlook for our business. The current rate environment is stable and rational. We continue to believe that the Medicaid risk sharing corridors that were previously introduced are related to the declared public health emergency and will be eliminated as the COVID pandemic subsides. We continue to be bullish about the performance of our acquired businesses. The operational integrations are proceeding as or better than planned, and we have high confidence in achieving our original accretion estimates and possibly even exceeding them. In the context of the pandemic subsiding and our acquisitions maturing, the embedded earnings power of the business, as it exists today is at least $4 higher than our adjusted earnings per share guidance. The emergence of embedded earnings combined with our future growth creates a very attractive earnings growth outlook. Our first quarter performance demonstrates that our growth plan is working well. We have built sound operational infrastructure, which allows us to operationally execute and maintain these attractive margins. We have reinvigorated our platforms to drive organic membership growth. We have built winning RFP and M&A capabilities that have catalyzed our growth and accessing new opportunities and we continue to focus on capital allocation and free cash flow generation to create shareholder value. The political, legislative, and regulatory trends are positive for the businesses we are in and our management team is well established, disciplined, and laser focused on our mission to serve members and shareholders. I look forward to sharing more about our future growth plans and longer term strategy at our investor day in September. As I conclude my remarks, I want to express my gratitude to our management team and our nearly 13,000 Molina colleagues. Their skill, dedication and steadfast service formed the foundation for everything we have achieved and everything we will achieve in the years to come. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Keim for some additional color on the financials.
Mark Keim: Thank you Joe. And good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss some additional details on our first quarter performance, and then turn to our growth strategy balance sheet and some thoughts on our 2021 guidance. Beginning with some detailed commentary about our first quarter results there was virtually no incidence of the normal flu in the first quarter. Historically, a normal flu season would have resulted in $25 million to $40 million in medical costs in the first quarter. Severe winter weather resulted in unusually low utilization in many areas of the country in the month of February. While it's difficult to separate weather effects from other effects, there's no question it had an impact on the month. To the extent the types of services not utilized during the time are elective and discretionary, that utilization will likely begin to rebound. Much of the impact is timing. Well, the net effect of COVID wasn't aligned with our expectations and negligible to the quarter in total, the impacts were varied across our lines of business. We experienced higher direct cost of COVID related care in January, which then tapered off as the quarter progressed. We saw some pockets of non-COVID related utilization increases, but overall utilization was in line with expectations. In Medicaid, we generally experienced a modest utilization curtailment on inpatient and outpatient services. A significant portion of the resulting medical margin outperformance was recaptured by the COVID risk sharing corridors in several states. In contrast, our Medicare and marketplace businesses experienced disproportionately negative impacts due to an increase in direct cost of COVID related care in the quarter. The year-over-year MCR comparisons in these lines of businesses are less meaningful, as the current quarter includes these impacts from COVID and the first quarter of 2020 does not. In Medicare, the net effect of COVID increased the MCR by approximately 400 basis points in the quarter. In addition, the Medicare MCR was negatively impacted by the temporary challenge of risk scores that do not fully reflect the acuity of the membership. This is an industry wide issue that we mentioned when we gave our initial guidance. We're expecting COVID to dissipate through the year and anticipate four year Medicare MCRs in the high 80s. Marketplace experienced the high level of COVID cases early in the quarter which moderated throughout the quarter. Several of our markets were disproportionately impacted by COVID as a result of higher local infection rates. The COVID impacted marketplace increased the MCR by approximately 500 basis points in the quarter. With that said we expect the net effect of COVID to subside and continue to expect full year pre-tax margins in the mid single digit. I will now provide some commentary on our growth strategy beginning with M&A. Last week's announcement of our intent to acquire a Cigna Texas Medicaid and MMP business marks our fifth acquisition since our pivot to growth, ultimately reflecting the addition of 7 billion in annualized revenue. The Cigna transaction is expected to increase our Texas membership by 50,000, provide approximately a billion in annualized revenues, and drive accretion of at least $0.40 per diluted share in the first full year of ownership. This transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2021 and it's not included in our full year 2021 guidance. We now expect the Affinity transaction to close in the third quarter. Affinity is expected to increase our New York membership by approximately 300,000 provide approximately 1.5 billion in annualized revenue with the creation of $0.15 to $0.20 per diluted share in the first full year of ownership. The impact of the Affinity acquisition is also not included in our full year 2021 guidance. Acquisitions will continue to be a meaningful part of our growth strategy. While we are a scaled government sponsored managed care company, we are still at a size that our pipeline of smaller consolidation targets can have a meaningful impact on our growth rate. We see significant earnings growth from these acquired revenues. We have demonstrated our ability to fix underperforming businesses, have the discipline to harvest fixed cost leverage, and have every expectation of managing our acquisitions to margins that are reflective of our current portfolio performance. Our pipeline of M&A opportunities is robust. We continue to pursue bolt on acquisitions, single state plans, and provide our own plans. We will not pursue capability plates. We are at pure play premium risk bearing government sponsored managed care business, and we see significant growth opportunities within this space. Our strong cash flow makes the acquisition growth possible. At our current margins, we generate significant excess cash and additional debt capacity. Between cash on hand, near term cash flow, and additional debt capacity we currently have acquisition capacity of over 1.3 billion. At the multiples we have paid in recent transactions this gives us the current ability to drive well in excess of 3 billion in annualized revenue growth. And more importantly, at our current level of performance, this acquisition capacity is repeated and produced every single year. Turning now to our balance sheet. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, and our reserve position remained strong. Days and claims payable at the end of the quarter represented 48 days of medical cost expense compared to 50 days in the fourth quarter, and 49 days in the first quarter of 2020. Prior year reserve development in the first quarter of 2021 was modestly favorable, but any P&L impact was absorbed by the COVID related risk corridors. Debt at the end of the quarter is 1.9 times trailing 12 month EBITDA. Our leverage ratio is 52%. However, on a net debt basis, net of parent company cash these ratios fall to 1.6 times and 47% respectively. Taken together, these metrics reflect a reasonably conservative leverage position. In the quarter, we repurchased an aggregate of approximately 577,000 shares for $122 million at an average price of approximately $211 per share. Our full year guidance continues to be based on 58.5 million shares. At the end of the quarter our parent company cash balance was 436 million. A few additional comments related to our earnings guidance. In raising our full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance to be no less than $13 per share, the following assumptions are relevant. A higher proportion of medical margin performance will be absorbed by the risk sharing corridors over the remainder of the year. The net effect of COVID remains a net cost of approximately $1.50 per share for the full year and lastly we expect 55% to 60% of full year EPS to be produced in the first half of the year. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator. We are now ready to take questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Kevin Fischbeck: Hi. Right. Thanks. Good morning. I guess I wanted to go to the source of the comments about $4 of upsides still to the guidance, I guess it sounded like the guidance raise was due in some part at least to re-determinations and the revenue and earnings from there, which obviously not something we would forecast going into next year. Does your $4 number now include the Cigna deal in there? Are there any kind of other puts and takes you're affirming the $50 COVID impact that component hasn't changed?
Joseph Zubretsky: Let me summarize what is in our guidance Kevin, this is Joe. When we guided to no less than $13 this year, we are including an additional margin on $600 million of Medicaid revenue due to the extension of the re-determination clause. We're also including a margin on the additional $400 million of marketplace revenue due to the increased membership. We are then hedging our forecast due to the uncertainty related to utilization in the last nine months of the year. So very clearly increasing our guidance to no less than $13 a share. What we have said when we gave our original guidance and continued to say is that the net cost of COVID inside that forecast is $1.50 a share. And if you recall the way we measure the COVID impact is any impact of curtailment or suppression of utilization offset by the direct costs of COVID related care absorbed then by the risk sharing corridors. We continue to believe that will cost our earnings $1.50 a share. So if you look at the impact of COVID as being an overhang of $1.50, the disruption to Medicare rescoring costing about another dollar per share, and then extend our acquisitions to their full state of maturity we say the embedded earnings power of the business currently is $4 higher than our current year guidance.
Kevin Fischbeck: Yes, I guess that's what you said last quarter, too. But you've taken out the core number this year on in part on things that don't seem sustainable. So I guess I was just wondering if there's any other kind of moving pieces to it as well.
Joseph Zubretsky: And to be clear of that $4, that's not a 2022 guidance number outlook. That is, as we sit here today, there are certain overhangs on the earnings, projection of the business that are causing our earnings to be lower this year than they otherwise would be when our acquisitions mature, and when COVID disappears. Obviously there will be a lot more puts and takes into next year. And when we give our outlook in September our investor day will give you a better look of what 2022 looks like. Obviously, the re-determination clause increasing revenue this year where does it peak, how far does it fall, how quickly does it a trip is going to be a major item in a year-over-year comparison. But with 47% revenue of premium revenue growth this year, we're not at all that concerned with the upticks of 2022 versus 2021 at this point.
Kevin Fischbeck: Yes. If I may just last question, you mentioned that the SCP membership right now the acuity is hard to forecast. Do you have any early data points around metal types or demographics on that enrollment that might give you some comfort that that's not going to be a significantly higher acuity population.
Joseph Zubretsky: So anytime you take on new membership by its very nature, inherently, you don't yet understand the acuity of that population. I mean, you start with an assumption that if somebody buys insurance, they generally need it. But our bronze-silver mix is about what we forecasted for the year. We have improved dramatically in attaining risk scores. We've improved that operation from last year, we recall it was a performance glitch last year, we've improved on it. All I can say at this point is we know we've improved and attunity risk scores compared to ourselves. Obviously, we don't have the industry data yet to compare how we're doing to our competitors, which will ultimately decide what risk scores we've attained. But we are doing better compared to ourselves, we'll be able to give a much clearer forecast on utilization trends, generally marketplace, Medicaid and Medicare, when we report our second quarter, but at this time, it's very prudent just to remain cautious, given the effects of the pandemic as it is still in full throes here in the first quarter is divides into the second and third.
Kevin Fischbeck: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Robert Jones at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. 
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, this is Kevin on for Bob this morning. I just want to clarify that you've made some comments just about hedging as it relates to COVID. I was curious if there's anything that you're actually seeing today that would make you more cautious or if this is just reflecting some conservatism given the environments just generally uncertain. 
Joseph Zubretsky: So I mean, Robert, we tried to be clear on this. We're not implying or merely suggesting we're being conservative. We're declaring we're being conservative. As we work through the quarter-over-quarter effects of the pandemic starting all the way back in the second quarter of last year the mini and micro inflections up and down that occur are very geographically dispersed very much tied to local infection rates, very much tied now to the improvement in the acuity to population to the vaccination rate and opening up of economies. And it is the variation in modeling utilization for the balance of the other variation in the various models is so wide, that we believe it's prudent just to be very cautious on how fast utilization will rebound, when does it rebound to pre-COVID Levels, does it rebound fully to pre-COVID levels, where and when and how is very much a variant at this point and it just is very prudent to remain cautious on utilization for the balance of the year.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. That's helpful. And then just one quick follow up. I know you've touched on still thinking about the COVID headwind being a buck 50. I know last quarter, you also talked about the MRA headwind being $1. Is the dollar still very kind of headwind to think about, or as your assumptions change on that at all?
Joseph Zubretsky: No, that's still a good number. The disruption and risk scoring cost about 300 basis points in our Medicare MCR for the quarter. If you can do the math on that, that's still pretty much the dollar for the year.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Helpful. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe just two quick questions. One, we've heard some about the marketplace environment that maybe there's some shifting and competitive landscape, rush to more narrow network programs that maybe, there's also been an uptick in churn among the members. You're growing that better than you expected. Are you seeing any of that or how would you put any of that in perspective? 
Joseph Zubretsky: Yes. The competitive landscape hasn't changed all that much. Yes some of the new entrants came into some of our markets, and started to build market share in those markets. But we're a very niche business. We do not serve affluent suburban. We serve the working poor. We've always said we built our marketplace networks off of our Medicaid networks, we priced them off our Medicaid networks and we're seeking out fully and highly subsidized members that are on government assistance. This is clearly an extension of our Medicaid strategy servicing the working for you. We like the position we're in not only are we improving our performance and growing, but it's not right size in the portfolio. Early on as we started this journey three years ago, there was no question that the marketplace earnings were outsized in relation to the portfolio. Now with marketplace revenues, representing about 10% of the total margins, mid single digit. So the earnings about 10% of the total as well. It's positioned nicely in the portfolio, strategically leverages our Medicaid infrastructure and is now a very good complement, financially and operationally good complement to our Medicaid business.
A.J. Rice: That's great. And then my follow up would be, on the risk corridor comments, I think original guidance had that being about a $250 million impact this year. It sounds like maybe it's a little more given how things have trended. But I wondered if you've updated that number and have you, it sounds like you're thinking at some point, these risk corridors got to roll off. Can you just tell us if you see any states that have actually begun to take action to eliminate these or what are you hearing as you talk to the states about any kind of timing around eliminating these risk corridors?
Joseph Zubretsky: Sure A.J. When we gave initial guidance, we never actually parsed to the components curtailment, direct cost of COVID care or the corridors. We said that the components are highly variable but the fact that the corridors do exist they do act as a buffer that we were very comfortable in the projection that COVID in total net would be a drag on earnings of $1.50 per share and we continue to say that. We never actually gave a specific quarter or a number. And you really shouldn't put the quarter numbers going to flex up and down with curtailment in the direct costs of COVID related to care, that's how they work. So to me, it's really the net number that's really important. Obviously, if the component parts get materially different, maybe we report on that, but right now, saying it's going to cost us $1.50 a share is the best metric to hang on. With respect to your second question, yes there's positive momentum that not only suggests but is concluding that the risk sharing corridors were related to the public health emergency. They were fully intended to recapture the portion of the capitated rate that was never paid out on benefits due to the pandemic and there is growing momentum with many of our state customers, the actuarial community, the public policy funded etc, that these will disappear as the COVID pandemic subsides. In fact, New York did not introduce a risk sharing corridor for its 22 fiscal year, which started on April 1 and California publicly declared that it is not introducing a corridor for its 22 fiscal year, which starts on January 1 of 2022, and there's lots of good momentum legislatively, administratively in many other states that are suggesting that these were related to the public health emergency and will begin to fall away as the pandemic subsides. Obviously, as that happens, as they become enacted or not enacted, we see draft rates will report as we report our quarters.
A.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead.
Scott Fidel: Hi, thanks, good morning, everyone. One of the, first just to ask about the taxes deal with Cigna and seems like a very attractive price that you're paying on a price per revenue basis and obviously you are expecting it to be nicely accretive as well. So just want to get some more insight into essentially how you're able to acquire that asset for that type of pricing and maybe some insight into the existing margin profile? Is it underperforming now and you think that you'll be able to improve that improve on that or is the margin profile already running at a pretty solid level?
Joseph Zubretsky: Hi Scott. On the price like willing buyer willing seller, and that's the price we agreed to and without an allocation of capital 6% of revenue is clearly attractive. Now it's all about the Texas re-procurement and how this positions us in that re-procurement. So bolting on a billion dollars of revenue to our Texas Medicaid business, which is $2 billion strong right now increasing it by 50% adding two new regions where we're not present overlap and third is very-very attractive to our statewide presence. The business is profitable, marginally profitable but again, we bring Texas scale, we bring a lot more infrastructure, and we're going to leverage the daylights out of our fixed cost structure in the state of Texas we will be able to improve the margins due to our existing presence. So attractively priced, will recover the purchase price with the two first years of cash flow making it a free option upon re-procurement.
Scott Fidel: Got it. And the second question, just wanted to sort of net out I guess the framing on the exchange business and obviously had to COVID costs in the first quarter that you're not expecting to recur throughout the year you're keeping your outlook conservative but at the same time you are keeping your mid single digit margin target in place for the hex business. So just interested in maybe the competition within that mid single digit margin view change a bit where you're maybe assuming a bit higher on the MLR and you're getting more G&A leverage off the growth or just trying to sort of sync up sort of thinking about that the conservative since you change the margin target? Thanks.
Joseph Zubretsky: You're actually captured it perfectly. Our MCR will likely be in the mid to high 70s, where previously was in mid to low 70s. But we're getting to G&A leverage. Our G&A ratio is improving by 200 to 300 basis points, which, again, clearly puts us in the mid single digit pre-tax category. Now, there's a range around what pre-tax, single digit pre-tax means. But we have every reason to believe that given what we experienced in the first quarter, if the pandemic does subside, we get appropriate risk scores on the new membership that will achieve mid single digit margins even on the increased size of the business. Anytime you grow a business it puts pressure on margins but we're still committed to in forecasting that will be at mid single digits pre-tax even on the increased revenue.
Scott Fidel: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Justin Lake: Thanks. Good morning.
Joseph Zubretsky: Morning.
Justin Lake: First question a lot of talk about the federal emergency and the benefits of this year as you go through the year. Just wanted to get an idea of within that $4 of kind of upside you talked about in earnings power how much are you pulling out for the assumption if the Federal emergency goes away? So if that shuts off completely for 2022 and all those members leave, is there a number that you could share with us? I know that's not going to happen that way but just kind of understanding what you're pulling out of that earnings power of the 4 bucks?
Joseph Zubretsky: The first answer to the very specific question you asked is no. That was an embedded earnings were wasn't a 2022 forecasts. It wasn't a bridge to 2022. It was, when these three or four factors disappear the earnings power of our business, the embedded earnings power is $4 higher. It was not a projection. It was certainly not a forecast of the peak and membership and the attrition rate. So here's what's in our guidance. We extended the public health emergency and the re-determination period out four months. We originally said that for every month it gets extended, it would produce about $150 million of revenue to our annual total. So that's the 600 million. If it gets extended to the end of the year, it's probably another $300 million, $400 million. Now, where is it peak and how far does it fall and where does it fall is very much unclear. I maintain that all of the membership that we grew since the pandemic started organically at its peak, it'll be 750,000 members 600,000 to the end of last year. 650,000 at the end of last year, another 60,000 in the first quarter, maybe another 40,000 in the second. So at its peak, we've added 750,000 Medicaid members organically and whether that's through the re-determination pause, struggling economies, it doesn't matter. That was the organic growth. How fast that trips and where does it bottom? Unclear. I maintain that a larger proportion of those members will fit because the low wage service economy has been ravaged. We all see the economy coming back. But if you look at the numbers, the low wage service economy, the sandwich shops, the restaurants, the drycleaner shops, aren't coming back real fast and I still think there will be a significant amount of that membership that will be on Medicaid for an extended period of time. So no, that wasn't a 22 forecast. But your supposition is correct. When we do give 2022 guidance later this year into next year we'll have to bring you from the peak of Medicaid membership this year to the trough next year. And that'll be a year-over-year comparison item.
Justin Lake: So moving 2022. Joe just to be clear, like in the $4 are you assuming that that membership goes away or would it be current run rate plus $4 minus whatever happens with the Federal Emergency membership? That's 750,000.
Joseph Zubretsky: What we're saying is no, we're not saying that what we're saying is this year with the membership we have, we're earning $13 a share. And inside of that number is a $1.50 overhang to the COVID. It has nothing to do with the membership it's just the direct costs of COVID related care, utilization suppression in the corridors. So the only thing that's in the 150 are those three items, those three items not included in that COVID impact is any impact from increased membership.
Justin Lake: Okay. So we would have to subtract that just to be clear from the $4.
Joseph Zubretsky: If that was the calculus that you were doing. Yes. But again, we were not giving 2022 forecast. We were giving a pro forma view of the embedded earnings power of the business as it exists today. It was not a forward forecast.
Justin Lake: Got it. Alright, thanks for the color Joe.
Speaker: You are welcome Justin.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ricky Goldwasser: Yes, Hi, good morning. Just wanted to go back your comment around the exchange strange in one of the things that you talk about was a strong product design. We thought it in Ohio, you embedded primary care business city blocks in the RFP. Just wanted to get some more color on your primary care strategy and how we think embedding it in other states?
Joseph Zubretsky: Our network strategy and our marketplace is very traditional. We build the networks off of our Medicaid networks. In many cases they're slightly wider. Bear in mind that wider networks are always very attractive from a membership perspective but they carry a cost. But our marketplace network strategy is very traditional when it comes to hospitals, when it comes to specialty, services or primary care services. We are introducing in our Ohio RFP win a few new twists and turns with vendors partners that are going to help us deliver more community based care wrapping around primary care physicians to make them more effective. But I would say on balance our marketplace, network strategy is very traditional. We did introduce a couple of very innovative programs in our Ohio RFP. There's a company by the name of City block which has a very-very innovative approach to delivering care in the communities, in the home setting, reaching out into neighborhoods to find people that need care. This is a big problem in Medicaid. When people come into the hospital we'll get them the care we need. But finding them before the bad stuff happens is really a challenge. And I think this company, City block, which is a great partner is going to do a great job for us in the state of Ohio.
Ricky Goldwasser: And should we think about this as sort of a pilot, and if this is successful, it's something that you can expand into other states?
Joseph Zubretsky: I would answer the question more generally that we are passionate about serving our state customers and I talk to and my team talks to the leaders of the Medicaid agencies, the governor's people in high administrative positions in government, always trying to understand what their most burning problems are, and whether it's social determinants of health, whether it's the opioid use, epidemic, racial disparities in healthcare. We are creating and providing innovative solutions to solve those problems, not only through our delivery of our Medicaid product but also in our $150 million commitment and what we call the Molina Cares Accord to put money back into the communities we serve. This is really important part of the relationship with the state customer, not only innovative programs that help drive down cost in the Medicaid program, but being committed to the communities that we serve. So yes it is a very common theme no matter where we go in our existing states or when we pitch a new state.
Ricky Goldwasser: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Steve Valiquette: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So just for the public health emergency, you change your expectation for this to run through the end of 3Q, 21. Some of your MCR peers have a say in this around three year and seems HHS themselves have given some signals reported in the press that it also could run through year end. I am just curious if there's any political lead or some that suggest to you that maybe it's less likely to run through year end. Just any additional color on your thought pattern extension through 3Q versus something beyond that. Thanks.
Joseph Zubretsky: Thanks for the question Steve. No, don't read any political insights into that. We just chose to extend it four months out to the end of September at $150 million per that $600 million of additional revenue. But no, we have no other insights. If it gets pushed out to the end of the year it's likely at a minimum $300 billion more in our 2021 premium revenue forecast. So no. No other insights except perhaps a measure of conservatism.
Steve Valiquette: Okay, alright. That's perfect. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Joshua Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Joshua Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Joe, just want to clarify, I think you said no new corridor in New York. I think that was just for 2022. But I assume you've got the 2021 with the retro. And then are any states actually contemplating new corridors that are still kind of a little bit behind in the game that are trying to look back and figure that out and I guess the last part of the question would be why would a state eliminate it? What would the rationale be for a state to operate in the future if there's other issues, etc? What would be the rationale for saying hey, we don't need the corridors in place?
Joseph Zubretsky: The answer to the first question you asked very specifically was yes, fully captured the retro corridor from April 22 back, but they did not introduce one for April 1, I am sorry April 21 but they did not introduce one for the 21/22 fiscal year. So that is correct. The white papers have been written on this. In the midst of a pandemic when you believe that a lot of the capitated rate is not going to get paid in services you come up with a construct as arbitrary as it is to recapture a portion of that rate. There are lots of ways to do that. We believe and many others believe that the risks sharing corridors even being symmetrical are not the appropriate way to do that. And here's the basic reason why. It actually penalizes an efficient operator, and promotes and rewards an inefficient operator. These things are symmetrical. If you had a 90% MLR target and you're beating it, you pay it, whether you beat it because a COVID or beat it just because you're better, you pay in. And if someone's operating at 92, they get a check. So it promotes in efficiency by not allowing efficient operators to hold on to the portion of the capitated rate, that they're truly driving through performance, knowing that whatever costs actually emerge, end up in rates eventually. If we keep driving down the cost of the program by being efficient, that ends up in the rate base on a lag basis. And that's why we should go back to and most people believe that the traditional rate setting process, setting a rate prospectively based on the observed trends in the business is the right way to go. Clearly, during the pandemic, they needed to do something quick, they got actuarial advice that supported this. But the momentum for these things is waning and the discussions that we're having with various of our state customers is suggesting that these things are going to disappear as the pandemic subsides.
Joshua Raskin: That makes a ton of sense. So do you have alternatives? I mean, I understand the rate setting process is, the tradition rates processes is your preferred way. But clearly, in a pandemic, it's very difficult to parse out to your point what was COVID related versus what was company efficiencies or inefficiencies is there, have you provided data to the states that you feel comfortable that they actually know what the COVID impact was or is that kind of why they're using the blunt object of risk corridors?
Joseph Zubretsky: Good question. It has been provided and of course, they have their own actuarial they use some of the largest firms in the country make household names that are recognizable to you. So they have their own actuarial resources. But yes, that's exactly the point and as trends come back to normal without these mini and micro inflections that happen across the country we believe and I believe the actuarial committee believes that will just revert back to the traditional rate setting process on a prospectively set basis. Eventually costs end up in race when costs are inflecting high they lag and managed care suffers and when trends are trending low and rates lag you went and you just work the ebbs and flows and the mini cycles of the business. That serve this business well for decades and decades and we believe that most Medicaid directors and most actuarial firms get that and are of the mind that as the pandemic subsides and disappears these constructs will disappear as well.
Joshua Raskin: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Matthew Borsch: Maybe I could just pick up on Joshua's question there. And the timing of the risk corridors rolling off? Is that actually going to be potentially a net negative to you at least relative to what you might have experienced that those risk corridors remained in place. What I'm really pointing to is the potential for above trend utilization in maybe the back half of this year or going into 2022 where the risk corridors would have served as something that was actually helpful to you. And so I guess what I'm wondering are they being pulled away exactly the wrong time?
Joseph Zubretsky: Great question. Here's the way we think about them. First of all about sort of getting surprised by them or having an inordinate effect or an unanticipated effect they can no longer be retroactive. So the ones that are in place are in place. In order to be an active they have to be prospective in nature and they will coincide with the rate cycles. Most of our rates are one January one rates. We have a couple of default, Michigan, Texas. We have some July ones, Mississippi and South Carolina. So they will follow the rate cycle. So the quarters that we're now recording are the ones that have been inactive. You can't record a quarter that hasn't been inactive. Now if any one of these states that comes up for renewal inside the year enacts one, it could be an additional item for the year. But our feeling is that most of the states that come up this year it's either late in the year or they're smaller and it shouldn't have a big impact. The real wildcard and forecasting these is where you're under and over performance happens. There is very-very clearly that if you're in the money on a corridor, $1 of over performance goes against the corridor, very simple. But where's the dollar over underperformance going to occur? If it occurs in California that has no corridor we get to keep it. If that happens in Michigan, where we have a corridor we don't. And so when we said that the existence of these corridors adds an element of variability it's projecting where you're going to over and under performance that adds the element of variability. But right now we know where they are. They cannot be enacted retrospectively. They could be introduced for the 2022 fiscal year in a couple of states. We don't think that'll happen but it's possible. So we don't think there's a huge element of variability with respect to the introduction of the corridors but there is an element of forecast variability to where your under or over performance actually occurs.
Matthew Borsch: That makes sense. Thank you, and then just follow up on it slightly different point. With the Medicare risk adjusters and the impact there it seems like it's having a larger basis point impact on your MCR in Medicare, if I compare that to some of you, or some of the other companies that, of course, have much larger books in Medicare. Is that some what the law of large numbers or law of small numbers that would account for the higher volatility?
Joseph Zubretsky: Yes. We're very concentrated. A lot of this happens in our MMP book. Michigan, which had a very-very high infection rate, and we have a very robust Medicare business got hits specifically. So yes it's the law of large numbers. We're not nationwide. We're in a handful of places with material membership. I cited one but that's what it is. It's the randomness of where the infection is and where our membership is.
Matthew Borsch: Got it. Thank you.
Joseph Zubretsky: If I may operator, before the next question is asked because no questions were really asked on one of these lines. I did want to make a comment that doesn't respond to a question. But last night there was some very positive news that broke and I wanted to take this opportunity in a compliant format to mention it. Last night the Kentucky State Court issued an order which supported Molina's position as a Medicaid participant. They there was, as you know, some legal challenges to our award itself denied. There were legal challenges to our purchase of passport denied. There were legal challenges to the Novation of the passport contract to our business on September, 1 denied. What was upheld was the six plan model that the court stipulated many-many months ago. So as it stands today the ruling is that the Medicaid program continues on as is. We are operating in Kentucky under the passport brand. We have 326,000 members at the end of the quarter. We are performing really, really well and we're in good standing with the state. And the court has ruled as such. Now having said that the one stipulation that court didn't say was there was enough, I'm saying irregularity, but at least some aspects of the proposal process that perhaps weren't to their liking. And they asked for a re-procurement but didn't stipulate a date or time to that. So our point of view is, whenever that happens we'll be bidding on the contract but we'll be bidding as a strong incumbent. We've already won the contract twice. We will win it the third time and we're in great standing in the state. So positive news out of the Kentucky State Court last night. And just in case nobody asked the question that got to that issue I want to use this format to give you our position on that. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you all for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-11 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Molina Healthcare Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Julie Trudell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Molina Healthcare. Please go ahead.
Julie Trudell: Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; our current CFO, Tom Tran, who is retiring later this month; and our current Head of Transformation and Corporate Development and CFO-elect, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our fourth quarter earnings was distributed after the market close yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30-days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made herein or as of today, Thursday, February 11, 2021, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our fourth quarter 2020 press release. During our call, we will be making Forward-Looking Statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, the current environment, recent acquisitions, 2021 guidance and our longer-term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report for the 2019 year filed with the SEC, as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and our Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open up the call and take your questions. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe.
Joseph Zubretsky: Thank you, Julie, and good morning. Today, we will provide updates on several topics. First, we will cover enterprise-wide financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2020; second, we will provide initial earnings and earnings per share guidance for 2021; and lastly, we will conclude with some thoughts on our compelling strategic position and our future growth prospects. Let me start with fourth quarter highlights. Last night, we reported GAAP earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of $0.56 with net income of $34 million and total revenue of $5.2 billion a revenue increase of 22% over the prior year. On a normalized basis, defined as adjusted earnings per share and excluding the net effect of COVID, our earnings per diluted share were $2.29 for the fourth quarter. This is consistent with our performance in the first three quarters of 2020, each of which produced approximately $3 per share, after adjusting for the effect of COVID. Two items significantly impacted the earnings in the fourth quarter. The first and most prominent of these items was the net effect of COVID which decreased net income in the quarter by $3.80 per share. The most significant contributor to this impact was the continuation of rate refunds already in flight and the introduction in the quarter of COVID-related retroactive rate actions in California, Michigan and Ohio. These refunds taken together more than offset the net effect of modest utilization curtailment and a high level of COVID direct cost of care. The second significant item having an impact in the quarter came from adjustments that produced a combined net benefit of $1.07 in earnings per share. The most significant of these was a net benefit from the proceeds of federal litigation which was partially offset by a charitable contribution to our foundation. In summary, we are pleased with our normalized fourth quarter performance with respect to both the continued delivery of solid earnings and the focused execution of our growth strategy. All of this was achieved whilst dealing with the effects of the global pandemic. Now turning to the full-year, we reported full-year 2020 GAAP earnings per diluted share of $11.23, with net income of $673 million and a 3.5% after-tax margin. We generated premium revenue of $18.3 billion, an increase of 13% over 2019 reflecting increased membership. We ended the year with four million managed care members, a 700,000 member increase year-over-year, primarily due to growth in Medicaid. Our Medicaid enrollment finished the year strong at 3.6 million members, representing growth of over 640,000 members or 22% over the prior year. This increase reflects strong organic growth of 450,000 members or 15% as the suspension of redeterminations was the major catalyst for our Medicaid membership growth in 2020. Growth of 370,000 members related to the acquisitions of YourCare, which closed on July 1st and Passport, which closed on September 1st. This organic and inorganic growth was offset by the 180,000 member decline related to our planned exit from Puerto Rico. I will now provide additional color on our full-year normalized financial performance which better expresses the underlying strength of our business by isolating the transitory effects of COVID and adjustments. On a normalized basis, our earnings per diluted share were $12.97 for the full-year. Our normalized performance comfortably exceeded our full-year guidance of $11.20 to $11.70 per share, which was established in the absence of COVID and is therefore the most relevant comparison. With respect to medical margins, for the full-year, our MCR on a normalized basis was 85.9% compared to 85.8% in the prior year. In Medicaid and Medicare, our performance met expectations, while in marketplace, our performance is below our expectations. Our normalized G&A ratio for the year was 7.3% compared to 7.7% in 2019 reflecting disciplined cost management and the benefits of scale produced by our substantial growth. We produced a normalized after-tax margin of 3.9% despite our marketplace business underperforming. We are very pleased that while dealing with the medical cost distortions and operational complexity caused by the pandemic, we produced a normalized margin, consistent with our long-term target. Now I will comment on the item-by-item effects of COVID on our full-year 2020 results. The net effect of COVID increased pre-tax income by approximately $180 million or $2.30 per share. This result is the sum of several identifiable positive and negative factors as follows: For the full-year, the net benefit from COVID-related utilization curtailment, offset by direct care related to COVID patients was approximately $420 million on a pre-tax basis. I should note that while utilization was moderately curtailed in both the fourth quarter and the full-year, in the fourth quarter direct COVID medical costs were higher than in any other quarter of the year. For the year, COVID related risk-sharing corridors reduced premium revenue and earnings by approximately $555 million on a pre-tax basis. $400 million of this amount was reported in the fourth quarter as the three new COVID-related risk-sharing corridors went active and corridors already existing at the end of the third quarter remained in effect. For the year, COVID-related activities increased our G&A spend by approximately $35 million on a pre-tax basis. Without question, the effects of COVID created significant distortions to our 2020 operating metrics, but the underlying operating fundamentals and financial metrics remain strong. Turning to our 2021 guidance beginning with premium revenue, we are very pleased with the rapid activation of our growth strategy. In 2021, we project premium revenue of at least $23 billion, a 25% increase over 2020. This growth is well balanced between a new contract win, organic growth both on acquisition benefit expansions in our existing geographies and greater penetration of our Medicare and Marketplace products into our Medicaid footprint. More specifically, our premium revenue guidance includes a full-year of the acquired Magellan Complete Care businesses, which we closed on December 31st. A full-year of Kentucky revenue, which commenced on September 1, 2020, a full-year of revenue from the YourCare membership in upstate New York, which we assumed on July 1, 2020. Marketplace revenue growth of 25% to 30% as we begin this year with more than 500,000 members. The full-year carve-in of the pharmacy benefit in the state of Washington, which is somewhat offset by a partial year of pharmacy carve-outs in New York and California, and the revenue decrease associated with our planned exit from Puerto Rico. The impact of the Affinity acquisition is not included in our premium revenue guidance. We expect the transaction to close as early as the second quarter, so the acquisition could provide $600 million or more in additional premium revenue in 2021. Our guidance includes membership growth relating to the current public off emergency extension set end in mid-April 2021, with a steady decline over the remainder of the year as redetermination is activated. The Biden administration has recently indicated that it is likely the public health emergency will remain in place for the entirety of the year. If so, states could continue to receive the additional 6.2% FMAP match throughout 2021, which would likewise extend the redetermination suspension requirement for the state. Although we have been adding more than 100,000 Medicaid members per quarter during the redetermination suspension in 2020, it is unclear whether this pattern would continue should PHE be extended further. Therefore, we have not included in our guidance an estimate of revenue associated with additional volumes from potential PAG extensions. However, any extension of the PAG accompanied by redetermination suspension could certainly represent upside to our 2021 revenue outlook. We estimate that for every month, the redetermination suspension is extended past April. It could provide additional revenue of approximately $150 million per month. Turning now to earnings guidance, given our recent and expected continued M&A activity, adjusted earnings per share have become a more relevant measure of our earnings going forward and would be the focus of our comments today. Our initial full-year 2021 adjusted earnings guidance is in the range of $12.50 to $13 per share or approximately 20% growth from 2020 adjusted earnings of $10.57 per share. The upper end of our 2021 guidance range is essentially equal to our 2020 normalized earnings per share of $12.97. Our 2021 earnings profile reflects durable and sustainable operating improvements and earnings growth which are being temporarily muted by a [ephemeral] (Ph) industry-wide challenges. Specifically, our 2021 earnings guidance reflects the following positive long-term value drivers: Continued strong performance in Medicaid and Medicare, reflecting an actuarially sound base rate environment. Margin recovery and growth in our Marketplace business which we target to achieve mid-single-digit pre-tax margins for 2021 as a result of our intense focus on operational improvements and continued competitive prices and product designs; and accretion from the Magellan Complete Care businesses into our Kentucky and Passport installation. Our earnings guidance also considers the following industry-wide environmental challenges, including another net negative impact from COVID, although at a reduced level, due to the continuation of many of the risk-sharing corridors that existed in 2020 and the direct cost of COVID-related patient care, offset by the moderate utilization curtailment. And lower-than-expected Medicare risk scores, which are an industry-wide challenge that would pressure results. Our risk scores do not fully reflect the acuity of our membership as in 2020 seniors reduced their access to health care services and therefore, risks or cash is more challenging. Referencing these catalysts and challenges, we now quantify the progression from our 2020 normalized earnings of $12.97 per share to the midpoint of our 2021 adjusted earnings guidance of $12.75 per share. We expect strong core performance to contribute approximately $1.25 in adjusted earnings per share growth, emerging mostly from Marketplace as Medicaid and Medicare margins are near optimal. And accretion from our acquisitions, along with share repurchases, will positively impact adjusted earnings by approximately $1 per share. Offsetting these positive factors are two industry-wide environmental challenges that temporarily pressure earnings, specifically, we expect the net effect of COVID consisting of utilization curtailment and direct cost of care, offset by risk-sharing corridors to continue to negatively impact earnings, but in 2021 by approximately $1.50 per share. And the temporary Medicare risk score shortfall phenomenon would pressure results by approximately $1 per share. All of these items, when combined with the initial performance of recent acquisitions operating below target margins, impact our 2021 MCR and by approximately 200 basis points when compared to 2020 normalized. This corresponds to a 90 basis point impact on the net income margin. Our 2021 guidance represents solid underlying earnings growth, but it is a constrained picture of the embedded earnings power of the company. The financial profile that we can develop when COVID and industry-related headwinds abate. And when our acquisitions achieve their full run rate potential will include: first, the net effect of COVID in the Medicare risk score disruption has created approximately $2.50 of adjusted earnings per share overhang. We would expect this overhang to disappear as COVID abates. Second, once we obtain our targeted margins on Magellan Complete Care and Kentucky and once Affinity is closed and synergized, we would expect to achieve additional adjusted earnings per share of at least $1.50. In short, our pro forma run rate after the natural relaxation of these temporary constraints, would produce an after-tax margin of approximately 4%, which is in line with our recent performance and produce adjusted earnings per share comfortably in the mid-teens. I will now provide a few concluding comments that frame the compelling strategic position we have created. The execution of our margin sustainability and revenue growth strategy has allowed us to create a very attractive financial profile. Despite all of the near-term distortions caused by COVID, the achievement of our 2021 guidance implies generating EBITDA of $1.2 billion with adjusted EBITDA margins in excess of 5%, producing a return on equity of nearly 40% and which is a function of our attractive margin position and disciplined deployment of growth capital; projecting contribution margin upside as we soon expect to achieve our target margins in our acquired businesses. Generating excess cash flow, which, when combined with leverage, gives us the continued ability to acquire businesses in our quarter; producing a two-year compound annual growth rate of 20%; and to summarize, that the durable earnings catalysts being sustained and as the temporary earnings challenges dissipate, our operating profile would produce mid-teens earnings per share. Despite the challenges and near-term distortions caused by the global pandemic, Our confidence in the growth, earnings power and resilience of our business remains high. The inherent growth characteristics of these businesses are exceptionally strong, and we will execute in harvest growth through winning new states, growing market share in our existing states, increasing penetration in high-acuity populations and actioning accretive acquisitions in our core business. We will continue to sustain best-in-class operating metrics and margins drive the top line growth and remain relentlessly focused on our value-creating mission. I will note that despite the vicissitudes of the economy and despite the pandemic, our management team and our associates have demonstrated tenacity, a determination and an ability to deliver. We are in the right businesses with the right people at the right time. Our future is very bright. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for some additional color on the financials. Tom.
Thomas Tran: Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. I’m going to discuss our balance sheet, cash flow and 2021 outlook. Operating cash flow for the full-year 2020 was $1.9 billion, reflecting the strong operating result rose membership and the timing of government receipts and payments. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, and our reserve position remains strong. Days in claim payable at the end of the quarter represents 50-days of medical cost expense compared to 52-days in the third quarter of 2020 and 50-days in the fourth quarter of 2019. Prior year's reserve development in the fourth quarter of 2020 was modestly favorable and was negligible in the comparable period in 2019. We extract $280 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter and $635 million year-to-date. The parent company cash balance at December 31, 2020, were $644 million, a decrease from the prior quarter cash balance of approximately $1.3 billion, due primarily to the cash outlay for the Magellan Complete Care acquisition. As of December 31, 2020, our health plans had total statutory capital and surplus of approximately $2 billion, which equates to approximately 330% of risk-based capital. Through December 31, 2020, we repurchased an aggregate of approximately 760,000 shares for $159 million. At an average price of approximately $208 per share. We continue to reduce our cost of capital. In November of 2020, we closed on a private offering of $650 million senior notes due November 2030 and used a portion of the proceeds to repay the $330 million senior notes. Debt at the end of the quarter is 2.1 time trailing 12-month EBITDA. Our leverage ratio is 53%. However, On a net debt basis, not a parent company cash, the leverage ratio is 45%. Taken together, these metrics reflect a reasonably conservative leverage position. Now turning to guidance, we introduced our initial full-year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $12.50 to $13. We expect premium revenue to exceed $23 billion a greater than 25% increase over 2020, and total revenue is expected to exceed $24 billion. We expect the medical care ratio to be approximately 88%. The MCR increase over 2020 is primarily due to the continuing net effect of COVID, temporary Medicare risk score disruption and higher MCR from recent acquisitions. We expect our adjusted G&A ratio to improve to approximately 7%. This reflects continued disciplined cost management, revenue growth, and fixed cost leverage. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 25.6%. And adjusted after-tax margin is expected to be approximately 3%, which is impacted by approximately 90 basis points related to the items I just mentioned, including the continuing net effect of COVID, Medicare risk scores and initial performance of recent acquisition operating below target margins. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. please go ahead.
Matthew Borsch: Yes good morning. I was hoping you could just talk a little bit about the marketplace special enrollment period. And how you expect that to impact you when you take into consideration what you have characterized this underperformance in 2020?
Joseph Zubretsky: Sure, Matt. Our forecast for membership in the marketplace starting the year with 500,000 ending the year with just under four and a thousand and didn't contemplate the special enrollment period. We are certainly aware of it. We certainly have forecasted what it could provide. And for those 90-days, it couldn't provide anywhere from 20,000 to 30,000 additional members. We are forecasting that potentially it could provide an extra $100 million to $150 million of revenue for the year. Now in the context of our margin recovery process, it is unaffected by that. We are very comfortable with the pricing we put into the marketplace, we are very comfortable with our product designs and our benefit designs, our product positioning, and we are very comfortable in achieving our mid-single-digit pre-tax margins for the year, irrespective of any additional revenue attained to the special enrollment period.
Matthew Borsch: And maybe if I, just related to that, how much do you think the competitive environment in the marketplace impacts your efforts to get to the mid-single-digit level?
Joseph Zubretsky: Well, it is very competitive. There is lots of new entrants, but we are very confident. And one of the reasons we are confident is the two areas of operational let down, if you will in 2020, utilization review and attainment risk scores. We have introduced operational excellence of those two operating fundamentals and our other two businesses. We are really good at it in Medicaid and really good at it in Medicare. And we were just behind and importing those skills that exist in our company to the marketplace platform. That has been corrected. And so we are very comfortable that by executing across those two fundamentals, we will get back to mid-single-digit margins.
Matthew Borsch: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ricky Goldwasser: Hi, good morning. A couple of questions here. Just thinking about the onetime items in 2021, just to clarify, as we think about 2022, what can we exclude from the sort of temporary onetime headwind? As we think about sort of kind of like the starting point for next year? Because it just a COVID it caused and a number of moving parts in it.
Joseph Zubretsky: Sure. During our prepared remarks, we gave a sort of a qualitative bridge - quantitative bridge committed bridge and understanding the catalysts and pressures inside our 2021 guidance all with the goal of helping our investors understand what might be looked at as a jumping off point into 2022. So here are the puts and takes. First of all, the net effect of COVID of $1.50 per share or $110 million of pre-tax will dissipate overtime as utilization comes back to normal, as the risk quarters disappear that $1.50 overhead will evaporate as the pandemic is solved. In addition, the Medicare risk score phenomenon, last year was an interesting year. Seniors didn't access health care. And so interacting with them, getting the right codes to attain the right risk force us was a challenge, not just for us, but for many of our competitors. Next year, we will either - meaning this year, we will either attain the risk scores, because they will be getting services, or if we aren’t satisfied that we can, we can include that in our bids. And last year, obviously, the bids were done far before the impact of COVID has ever known. So we are very comfortable that combined at $2.50 overhang sort of disappears as COVID gets behind us. As we said, in addition, our acquisitions are being integrated really, really well, and we are very comfortable with the $1 of accretion that we are putting in this year's guidance, but we are also comfortable in saying, that when they hit their full target margin and when Affinity is closed and hit its target margin, there is an additional $1.50 of earnings per share there. So all in, there is a good $4 of earnings per share embedded power sitting inside our 2021 guidance.
Ricky Goldwasser: And just to follow when we think about the acquisitions, I mean, clearly, you have done multiple acquisitions in 2020. How should we think about sort of management bandwidth to continue to do acquisitions in 2021 or should we think about you kind of taking sort of a pause this year, making sure that they are all integrated getting to the target margin and then coming back to the market?
Joseph Zubretsky: We have created the bandwidth. We have an expert M&A team that finds the properties and knows how to action them and close them. We have built a world-class integration team. The Passport integration is going really well and the early read on the Magellan integration is going really, really well. That is why we are so comfortable in affirming the accretion targets that we have given you. We have actually very fortunately, laid out quite nicely on a timeline. By the time Magellan is fully integrated, we would just be closing on Affinity, perhaps by the second quarter. And so if we action one, two or who knows how many more this year and they close either late in the year, early next year, the timeline couldn't be more amenable to being very effective at integrating them and harvesting the accretion that we promised our investors.
Ricky Goldwasser: Thank you.
Joseph Zubretsky: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Robert Jones: Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess maybe just two on the bridge and I appreciate you guys breaking out a lot of these components, it looks like the core growth off of that 2020 baseline of $12.97 would be somewhere in the 9.5% range. I'm not sure how much of the HIF benefit would be flowing through. But obviously, that is below the long-term target of 12 to 15. Just wanted to see if you could maybe walk through some of the moving pieces here and probably more importantly, how you are thinking about the timeline to get back into that into that long-term range of 12 to 15.
Joseph Zubretsky: I want to make sure I understand your question. You are talking about the puts and takes within our 2021 guidance or beyond.
Robert Jones: Yes. Sorry, just in 2021, it seems like if you look at the core growth that you have laid out in these slides of $1.25 on top of the kind of $12.97, obviously, that would be below the long-term targets. Just curious if you could talk through kind of getting back towards that range. And obviously, it sounds like there are some tailwinds that are not necessarily baked in yet, which I'm sure would be helpful. But I just wanted to get your thoughts on the growth you have laid out here at the core versus getting back to the long-term range.
Joseph Zubretsky: Sure. Well, bear in mind that the core performance here is irrespective of the net effect of COVID, which is tracked in a different place as the way we have articulated this. So the $1.25 is mostly the marketplace since that was the business that underperformed last year. It was just about breakeven in 2020, and we are targeting mid-single-digit pre-tax. And if you look at the potential for $1.9 billion, $2 billion of revenue, you can start to formulate a picture of how that is a significant contributor to the $1.25 core performance tailwind into this year. There are some puts and takes there, but with Medicare and Medicaid margins where they are, we are going to grow the top line and obtain the margin position there is. But there is not a lot of margin upside in Medicare and Medicaid. So we are very comfortable with the position that we presented here from a core business perspective. Medicare and Medicaid are pretty much optimized with respect to margins. The marketplace as a first step to getting back to where we said we would be. A mid-single-digit pre-tax margin would be our target for 2021.
Robert Jones: Now, that is super helpful. I guess just one follow-up on the bridge, the dollar you have here for acquisitions and repos, and if I remember, I think you guys had called out $0.50 to $0.75 expected from Magellan. It sounded like YourCare and maybe the Puerto Rico exit would roughly net out. So $0.40 for repo and I think fast forward would be the other swing factor. I guess, first, does that math make sense as far as trying to bridge to that dollar and then how should we think about the split between repo and Passport to make up that $0.40 balance?
Joseph Zubretsky: Yes, you are generally in the right area. If I were to break apart the dollar, I would say that $0.75 is Magellan, which is the top end of the range that we committed to for the first full-year of ownership, $0.10 on Kentucky. It would be very close to breakeven in the first full-year of ownership, and we will drive it to peak margins after that and about $0.15 on buyback. That is how you get to the dollar.
Robert Jones: Super helpful. thanks Joe.
Joseph Zubretsky: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Charles Rhyee: Yes, hi thanks for taking the question. Joe, I just wanted to just follow-up to just to clarify one other thing. I apologize if I missed that. When we talk about the net effect of COVID in the $1.50, is that pulling out all the effective COVID you have been for acquisitions? I guess the question is in your assumptions for accretion here in 2021 for something like Kentucky, are you factoring in the impact of COVID or Passport within the acquisition bucket or is it all in the COVID bucket?
Joseph Zubretsky: We have attempted to capture all COVID impacts in the COVID line item. And just to sort of reframe how we track that, our estimate of COVID impact, is the amount of medical cost suppression we believe we have observed offset by the direct cost of caring for COVID patients. And then, of course, both offset by the impact of any liabilities generated due to the retroactive rate refunds or corridors. That is how we capture it. And if it related to an acquisition is captured in the COVID line.
Charles Rhyee: Okay, thank you. And just a quick follow-up in Kentucky and Passport, do we have a sense yet on timing for when they are going to do sort of the on enrollment, so you will know what your sort of membership numbers will look like?
Joseph Zubretsky: In Kentucky, the open enrollment period was extended to March 15th. So there is still members moving around. We began the year with 320,000 members. The latest accounting has us about in that same zone. But on March 15th, the period will shutdown, and we will know how many members that we are beginning our new contract with.
Charles Rhyee: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Joseph Zubretsky:
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Gary Taylor: Hey good morning Joe. I just wanted to make sure I understand what you are saying about your reverification assumptions. So when we look at, for example, the bridge between 2020 and 2021, that $1.25 of core growth, you are saying most of that is from exchanges. But if you are anticipating at this moment that you are still going to have reverifications in mid-year start to take place and some of your Medicaid enrollment rolling off, I'm presuming there is like a net negative number embedded in there. Is that the right way to think about it and I just want to make sure you are suggesting if that doesn't happen this year, whatever the embedded negative number is that comes back and can you size that for us?
Joseph Zubretsky: Sure. It is interesting because it is all about your assumption of how fast membership roles will attrite once the states turn redetermination back on. But I would tell you, in our numbers, the way the membership flows, both in 2020 and 2021, there is actually a member month increase in 2021, just based on the timing of both acquisitions and redetermination. So no, I would say that the redetermination process is with the 100% upside to our revenue and earnings picture in the year. We just felt it wasn't prudent nor did we have any credible way of estimating how many more members we would get if the redetermination pause was extended, and then how fast would they actually roll off depending on how states plan to implement the reintroduction of the determination. So I would just say that the redetermination issue or phenomenon is upside to both our revenue and earnings guidance for the year.
Gary Taylor: So you have still got enrollment growth playing out now through the first half, some assumptions about some leakage in the second half, but that weighted average is still positive year-over-year.
Joseph Zubretsky: Yes. The way we look at it on a Medicaid basis, we are beginning the year with 3.6 million members. On January 1st, 200,000 members come over due to MCC. And in the first quarter, based on our historical average of about 30,000 a month during redetermination suspension. We pull in another 100,000 members. It would hit its peak at 3.9, but then 600,000 would roll off in the balance of the year. Now that is a pretty quick roll off, and it might happen slower, which is another perhaps element of conservatism in our forecast. And yes, if you then process that against 2020 and the timing of how membership grew and the timing of our acquisitions, there is actually a 9% number month growth in 2021 on Medicaid.
Gary Taylor: Very helpful. Thank you.
Joseph Zubretsky: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Justin Lake: Thanks, good morning. A couple of questions here. First, Joe, a lot of people at JPMorgan got the impression that that the COVID headwind was going to be materially less than the $2. So I'm curious if there is something that happened between then and now to push that number up closer to $2. And then you did a great job of kind of laying out for us the 2020 components within the COVID headwind. Can you do the same for 2021 and specifically on utilization? Can you tell us where you expect COVID cost to be versus normal utilization? Thanks.
Joseph Zubretsky: Sure, sure, so let's provide the context for 2020. Our estimate of medical cost suppression for the entire year was about $620 million. That was offset by approximately $200 million of the direct cost of COVID care for COVID patients, netting to a $420 million surplus, we hesitate to call it a benefit, a surplus due to the impact on medical costs from the COVID pandemic. And this is not an estimate, it is an actual number, recorded $565 million of rate refunds, risk-sharing quarter of liabilities in the year and that combined with additional G&A of $35 million resulted in a net $180 million cost of COVID in our company for the year, which is $2.30 a share. Juxtaposed against that, to answer now your direct question, we are forecasting a more moderate, more modest level of suppression. And the reason is both the supply and demand side of the health care economy were shutdown last year for a while. Patients were afraid to go in for services. And if they wanted them, there were many executive orders and direct mandates not to provide elective and discretionary procedures. The supply side is open for business this year, but we still think there would be a demand side softening and will result in utilization suppression of somewhere around $200 million for the year, which is one-third of the amount of suppression we experienced in 2020. We will incur direct costs of COVID care. And the net of all that is somewhere between $140 million and $150 million. Most of this, we forecast will happen in the first half of the year. Hopefully, the vaccinations in the vaccine and social distancing will cause all this to really dissipate in the later half of the year. Now against that, we are also forecasting approximately $250 million of impact from retroactive or not retroactive, but risk-sharing quarters, I should say, which nets to about $110 million, which is your $1.50 a share. So the gross numbers are a lot less dramatic, but it is still netting to $1.50 a share. One of the reasons we are very comfortable of this estimate is really we focus on the net impact. Because if utilization is higher or lower than expected, there would be some flex up and down with the risk-sharing corridors. There is actually sort of a natural hedge between the suppression and the corridors themselves. So we look at the net number, we are very comfortable with that net number. And as the pandemic goes away, we think this goes back to normal times, and there would be no impact from COVID on a going-forward basis, obviously. So I hope that helps that tail with tape. I know that was pretty detailed, but that is what's included in our $1.50 estimate for the cost of COVID for 2021.
Justin Lake: Joe that is really helpful and so what you are seeing here effectively is you have got $110 million risk corridor whole where they are just setting your margins lower than your typical target, and that is really the problem. The other stuff is going to flex up and down, but you are below target here by $110 million. like all of your states at this point have risk corridors, is there any uncertainty around more of them coming on?
Joseph Zubretsky: Let me address the first part. The answer to the first part, the response is, yes, that is true. If you are already in a risk corridor and your medical costs go up or down, there is no net impact on the company. But that is the way to look at it, that because risk sharing corridors didn't address COVID suppression specifically, it just addressed through MLR, then if you are outperforming your MLR targets, you are getting back some money to the state. So the intention was to have a direct correlation between COVID suppression in a corridor, but the corridor is against medical costs generally. So the fact that we are very profitable in some states, the fact that we outperform many of the market participants in some states, the rate refund number is probably a little higher than people might have expected. But the answer to your second part of your question is correct. It will flex up and down in a state where we are already in a corridor and we are a state where there is not, we would either enjoy the benefits of additional surplus or the effects of additional higher medical costs. The only state that made - the biggest state that does not have a corridor in 2021 is California. Texas and Washington already have done and all of our other states continue them on into 2021.
Justin Lake: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Scott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. First question, Joe, I just wanted to just talk a little conceptually about the long-term margin target. It looks like you gave us a crosswalk back to that 4% level that you had been guiding for us, the long-term view for the last couple of years. And just interested, though, and maybe taking the other side that a bit just in terms of comfort with that sort of longer term, just when we think about the exchange margin profile, you have rebate that since your Investor Day a couple of years ago, you guys are doing more inorganic growth, acquiring lower-margin businesses. So there is sort of a consistent mix impact that will likely come from that. And then also just at some of these risk corridor programs, the states end up liking them a bit light and end up keeping them. So I just wanted to just get your thoughts on sort of framing some of those maybe longer-term headwinds against that 4% long-term target.
Joseph Zubretsky: Sure, Scott. As we sit here in the second year of this global pandemic, we are not going to update our long-term margin guidance. We are just sort of going to go as you go, as you plow through this, start to form your views of what the landscape is looking like as you plow through it. I think that is the more prudent approach. But having said that, when you actually look at the pro forma impacts of many of these phenomenon that we consider quite temporary, you can pro forma this thing back to the high 3s or close to 4%. To the second part of your question, I actually hope that we always have a decrement sitting inside our margin for acquisitions that do not perform in their first year. That is a good decrement to have because if we can buy properties that are underperforming and with sweat equity, get them to perform, that is just another form of accretion. So the 40 basis points, this 40 basis points in our margin in 2021 in our guidance, that is literally related to the underperformance in the first year of our acquired properties both on the G&A line and on the MCR line. In the last part of your question was related to the risk corridors. Look, when they were introduced in 2020, they were clearly related to pandemic. They were presented that way, they were retroactive because they had to be because they were introduced mostly after the pandemic started. As they were reintroduced for 2021, they were presented as pandemic-related. The feeling was that there could be strange effects from the pandemic additional COVID costs, the cost of the vaccine, additional suppression, and that is why they were introduced on a symmetrical basis. You are protected on the downside and the state is protected on the upside. In CMS' approval guidelines, they have clearly stipulated that when they receive these for approval, they are viewing these as being attributed to the utilization impacts related to the pandemic. So it has been pretty clear to us that they were presented as relating to pandemic. CMS is approving them on the basis of relating to the pandemic. And we believe when the pandemic dissipates that these will disappear as well and will be back to the traditional rate-setting environment where rates are set prospectively using a credible medical cost baseline and a trend off that baseline.
Scott Fidel: Got it. And then just for my follow-up question. I know a lot of this content has just come out in the last day or two, and you guys are probably absorbing it. But just interested, Joe, in sort of your framing on some of the proposals that came out of ways and means on expanding the HIC subsidies and from E&C on some of the Medicaid expansion proposals and how you would frame the opportunity from that? And then I guess also caveated with that because they use reconciliation, the funding for it is only temporary for two-years. So I guess there would be questions on sustainability right at the funding, for example, the Republicans took back it to the House or the Senate in 2022.
Joseph Zubretsky: Well, thanks for that question. We are only three weeks into the new government and look what has been done. We all knew that the new government would be proponents of the social safety net of making sure the disadvantage have access to high-quality health care and plenty of subsidies so they can afford it. And look what has happened just in the first three weeks in terms of the executive order, at least the intention to extend the PHE to the end of the year. the executive order to introduce the special enrollment period on the marketplace. The executive order that the euphemism in the executive order was encouraging states to look at prior administration policies, which was really taking a shot at the public chargeable and Medicaid work requirements. So just what's come out of the White House in the past three weeks is incredibly bullish on government-sponsored health care, particularly for the disadvantaged. To your other point, things can get done through the reconciliation process and they are going to. The three committees in the house that generally write to health care issues are ways and means energy, e-commerce and oversight. And look at the language that they are introducing, increasing subsidies in the marketplace up to 150% of FPL. Making the product accessible to people over 400%, capping the cost at 8.5% of their income, and so on and so on and so on. Just in three weeks of a new government, both in the legislative bills that are coming out of the House and from Executive order in the White House just couldn't be better for government-sponsored Managed Care, and we are pleased to see that progress already being made.
Scott Fidel: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Windley: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Joe good morning. I wanted to follow on Gary's line of questioning on the redetermination. Last time around that when it was turned back on, there was kind of this realization that the risk profile or the margin on those folks redetermined off was pretty attractive, like maybe even included a lot of zero utilizers. I'm wondering if you think that is likely to happen this time around when that finally gets turned back on. And have you made that assumption in your guidance or in your estimates?
Joseph Zubretsky: The answer to your last part of your question, Dave, is no, we haven't. But it still remains to be seen what it does to the acuity of the population. Now because we haven't introduced many more members in our forecast, so our guidance only includes 100,000 member growth in the first quarter of the year and then the attrition starts in the last three quarters of the year. But we certainly have not forecasted a continued softening of the acuity profile of our membership base. And in fact, if that in fact happens, and it happens in a quarter, say, it will go back against corridors anyway. So net-net, The impact of the extension of the redetermination suspension is a net positive, on any dimension, it is a net positive to our guidance. We did not include any members past the first quarter, we rolled them off pretty quickly. As I said in my prepared remarks, if you take 500,000 members, which is sort of what we got in redetermination for every month at $300 PMPM there is $150 million of additional revenue. What is the margin profile of that revenue, you can speculate that it is very, very good as the acuity population improves as you get more members. But we have not included any of that impact in our guidance for the year, either the membership flow or a acuity improvement that is sort of a positive jolt to our earnings and earnings per share.
David Windley: Okay. And follow-up then, separate topic. As you think about to your comments earlier on having built the bandwidth and the integration team to continue to look at M&A, as you look at targets, does a thought around the balance of how you would like to build your book of business influence what you are looking at, i.e. increasing MA and - well, really MA, I guess, from an acquisition standpoint, in your mix or is it more opportunistic and what looks the best? How do you think about the balance of your book as it relates to inorganic growth?
Joseph Zubretsky: We would love to balance it out with more Medicare. They are hard to find. But we would love to balance out with more Medicare. We are growing it nicely organically, but we would love to find properties that have Medicare Advantage or D-SNP populations. I would say along the lines you have asked the question, we more look to the state. Is it a bolt-on within a state where we don't have so much market share that we couldn't get it done? Lighting up new states is really important. High acuity, really important, we are really good at high acuity. And there is a lot of players out there that have a lot of high-acuity lives and have little ability to manage them. So the upside on $1,500 of premium per month is huge, huge margin potential. So I would actually say that the geography is important, we love high acuity. And if they are underperforming but not broken, all the better because then we will take our operating team, open up the Molina playbook and drive accretion through margin expansion.
David Windley: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Kevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. Just wanted to make sure that I understand, you talked a lot about redeterminations this year. But I guess in theory, it is a headwind in 2022 guidance. It is not something that you guys spiked out as something that would be contrary to that $4 of earnings power. I wasn't sure if that was included in your kind of net COVID number when you thought about 2022 or that is something that we should separately identify if it is separate, are there any other kind of factors we should take into account?
Joseph Zubretsky: No. I mean, since we did not put the - any impact, if there is a positive impact from redetermination in 2021, since it is not in our guidance, we did not - then, therefore, create a headwind in 2022. So just to be very clear, I appreciate the question, any impact from the extension beyond April of any additional membership or a slower attrition of membership is not in our revenue guidance. And any profit enjoyed by additional member months in 2021 is not in our guidance. So as I said, we are really comfortable to it, there is only upside to 2021 on the redetermination suspension.
Kevin Fischbeck: Well I'm talking about what is in 2021 in your guidance, because you have it going through April and then slowly coming off as the year goes on. So to your point about member months, you will end at your Medicaid enrollment number, but your member months in 2021 will be higher than your 2022 member months just because redeterminations in for the first full quarter and partially rolling off as the year goes on.
Joseph Zubretsky: Sure, I understand your question. I'm sorry, I apologize I misunderstood your question. No, and again, we weren't giving a specific 2022 outlook. We are more trying to craft the bridge that we gave you as if we are guiding to $13 a share for 2021, sitting inside that is an earnings power that is higher than $13 due to some temporary phenomenon. But we weren't necessarily trying to extend into 2022 with an earnings or revenue bridge. Sorry, I misunderstood your initial question. But now that will come at a later date.
Kevin Fischbeck: Okay, so that is something else we should factor in to think about earnings power then?
Joseph Zubretsky: Sure, unless the suspension goes on and members stay on through the end of 2021, depending on other acquisitions that we might do, then there is the Affinity piece that is coming in. So we are not doing a 2022 guidance bridge per se. But I understand your question, and it is a legitimate one.
Kevin Fischbeck: Okay and then maybe just a second question, then the exchanges, it is obviously unusual to see a company grow very quickly and expand margins the way that you guys did. Obviously, it sounds like risk coding is part of it. But how should we think about that business? is 2021 guidance normalized margin? And how do you think about long-term the top line growth outlook for exchanges?
Joseph Zubretsky: We are going to be guarded in giving a forecast of where the margins will land. The competitive landscape changes every day. We are very comfortable in getting this to mid-single-digit pre-tax this year. Now our hope, again, given the competitive landscape, that would lead to mid-single-digit after-tax in the future. That is where we think the business could perform. But let's work through the 2021. There is a lot of revenue to bring on, a lot of members to service. Some of them are new. We will have to get their risk scores. So one step at a time, I asked my team, let's get to the mid-single-digit pre-tax margin this year. And then as we prepare our bids for 2022, let's sort through how much margin we think we can get and how much membership we think we can get. But starting the year with 500,000 and a 25% to 30% revenue growth year-over-year was a nice start to get back in the game in this business.
Kevin Fischbeck: Great. Alright, thanks.
Joseph Zubretsky: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Joshua Raskin: Thanks. Good morning. A question on the Medicare risk or headwind of the dollar per share, I sort of calculate that to about 3% of your total Medicare revenues which seems a little bit higher than I think what some others are suggesting. So I guess my question would be how much of your overall Medicare premium dollar actually comes from risk adjusters? And then are there any actions you are taking sort of shorter term to try and improve that risk scoring this year as you sort of get ready for next year and to the bids in the middle of the year?
Joseph Zubretsky: Yes, Josh, truth be told in that dollar is a little bit from the physician fee schedule. So we just didn't think it was that big enough to call out. So there is a little bit of physician fee schedule in there. But you are in the right zone, 2.5% to 3%, our risk score revenue is multiples of that, two to three times that at least from what I recall. And the industry had a choice last year. We are in the middle of the pandemic, it just started in March and April. We are now starting to develop your bid. And for the most part, while we always tend to be conservative in our bids, we didn't put any specific load for, okay, we are going to fall short on risk scores. Obviously, with hindsight, that cost us three points on the revenue line. But next year, meaning this year, we will either have an estimate of what we think we can attain, and then based on what we target for benefit design and our margins, we would then allow for that in the bid we submit. So either way, whether we get the risk for or whether we price to it, we think this is a one-year phenomenon. That is the way we look at it.
Joshua Raskin: Okay, got it. But it could be as much as a third to even half of your total risk score revenues disappearing this year. That is sort of the math, right?
Joseph Zubretsky: I think it is about a third. I will check that, but I think it is about a third.
Joshua Raskin: And then just a quick follow-up on your margins, where did you end 2020 full-year margins in Medicaid and Medicare?
Joseph Zubretsky: Where did we end? Well, again, depending on whether you look at a normalized basis or not, but, On adjusted earnings for 2020, we are at 3.3% net income margin, normalized 3.9%. And I would tell you that the individual margins for the lines of business were generally in line with our long-term targets. So 3.3% adjusted, 3.9% normalized, and the lines of business, acceptable marketplace, obviously, which is close to breakeven, we are pretty much in line.
Joshua Raskin: Alright.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
George Hill: Well thank you for that. Joe, as it relates to the Medicare risk scoring, I guess, can you talk about the timing or your expectations as it relates to the ability to conduct the beneficiary valuations and maybe talk about what you have seen in the back half of 2020 and kind of the expectations as we roll through 2021 just as your ability to get in front of these people?
Joseph Zubretsky: Sure, well, utilization did remain suppressed through the balance of 2020. It wasn't as suppressed late in the year. But look, our team is on this. We have a crackerjack Medicare team. They are all over this, and their instructions are very simple, have a credible estimate of how many interactions you can actually achieve, what is your reasonable estimate of proper risk scores attained. And to the extent it falls short of your long-term expectation, make sure you consider it in your bid. So either way, and obviously, with the goal of making sure your product remains competitive with benefit designs from competitors. So the team is all over it. And the good news is this year, we will have full visibility. Last year, it was [indiscernible] submitting your bids right as the pandemic was in full throttle. And we made the conscious decision not to introduce that into our bid. This year, we would think otherwise.
George Hill: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joe Zubretsky for any closing remarks.
Joseph Zubretsky: Thank you, operator. When we started this transformational journey over three-years ago, the work ahead moved pretty large. We knew that if we form the right team, that we could succeed, so we sought to recruit Managed Care industry veterans, battle-hardened veterans, if you will, who would know exactly what to do. Tom Tran personifies that. We developed a durable financial infrastructure that has been instrumental in our early success and which will have lasting impact. The team we built is a high-performing one, and we are very confident in their continued success. Tom's tireless energy, steady hand and good nature will certainly be missed by us all. Tom, on behalf of all of our constituents, and from me personally, thank you for your immense contribution to our success, and we wish you the best of luck and good health in your retirement. Operator, with that, we will end our call today.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open up the call and take your questions. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?
Joe Zubretsky: Thank you, Julie, and good morning. Today, we would like to provide you with updates on a number of topics. First, we will cover the enterprise-wide financial results for the third quarter. Second, we will discuss the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various aspects of our business. Third, we will convey our 2020 guidance in the context of our third quarter results. And fourth, we will provide an update related to the continued execution of our growth strategy. Let me start with the third quarter highlights. Last night, we reported GAAP earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of $3.10 with net income of $185 million. This result was supported by an MCR of 85.9%, a G&A ratio of 7.3%, and an after tax margin of 3.7%. Our year-to-date GAAP earnings per diluted share is now $10.65. On an adjusted basis, which excludes non-recurring non-operating items are earnings per diluted share were $3.36 for the third quarter. Excluded items related primarily to costs associated with our exit for Puerto Rico and startup costs associated with various growth initiatives. In summary, we are pleased with our third quarter performance, both with respect to the continued delivery of solid earnings and the focused execution of our growth strategy. All of this was achieved while dealing with the effects of a global pandemic. Unlike the second quarter, in which the combined COVID-related impacts serve to temporarily increase our earnings, in this third quarter, the combination of all COVID-related impacts net its way negligible to slightly positive impact on earnings. Therefore, our reported results and ex-COVID results are essentially the same. We will once again quantify the various COVID impacts on our results to provide some clarity on how they affected our operating metrics. But it is clear to us that our operating metrics were substantially in line with our expectations both as reported and as adjusted for COVID impacts. Now I will provide some highlights related to our third quarter results from an enterprise perspective. Beginning with revenue, our premium revenue of $4.8 billion increased by 17% over the prior year, and by nearly $400 million and 9% sequentially. Relatedly, our membership increased sequentially by 478,000 members or 13% primarily in Medicaid. Bear in mind, these increases include the membership and revenue of Passport, which we assumed on September 1 when the Commonwealth of Kentucky novated Passport’s Medicaid contract to Molina. With respect to medical margin with an 85.9% MCR, our performance was also strong and only modestly impacted by COVID. We experienced a modest amount of utilization curtailment, which was partially offset by the cost of COVID-related care. The net of which favorably impacted the medical cost line. This was substantially offset by COVID-related rate refunds on the premium revenue line. In the quarter, these items combined had a negligible impact on the total company medical margin and earnings, but serve to decrease the medical care ratio by approximately 60 basis points. This strong medical margin performance anchored by Medicaid reflects a sound non-COVID rate environment, continued excellent management of medical costs and a moderately lower acuity population. All of the COVID-related impacts on our third quarter metrics will be described in more detail in a few moments. Next, we continued to effectively manage our administrative costs through productivity gains and fixed cost leverage reducing a G&A ratio of 7.3% despite spending on specific COVID-related items, including the cost of servicing the additional membership volume. Net investment income usually not in earnings item with significant variability was again unusually low at $14 million compared to $40 million a year ago, due to the current low interest rate environment. Our line of business results were mostly in line with our expectations with strong metrics in both Medicaid and Medicare. However, our marketplace results fell short of our expectations. In Medicaid and Medicare, control over medical cost utilization and unit cost continues to provide the ballast for a sustained consistent performance all while ensuring our members receive high quality care. COVID-related impacts were slightly favorable in the Medicaid and Medicare businesses. Excluding the COVID-related impacts our performance and resulting margins in these lines still exceeded our pre-COVID expectations. In our marketplace business, the COVID-related impacts in the quarter were net unfavorable. We also operationally underperformed in our bronze product with respect to both utilization control and the achievement of risk scores that accurately reflect the acuity level of that population. We remain confident in our ability to titrate the medical margin performance of this metallic tier. As we have done in our Medicare and our flagship Medicaid business. In summary, we continue to perform well across the many domains of managed care and our operating fundamentals remain very strong. Now I will provide some commentary about the item by item effects of COVID on our third quarter. While these items are of note, when individually considered, together they net way negligible to slightly positive impact on enterprise earnings and earnings per share in the quarter. The COVID impacts on our quarterly results include a modest net decrease in medical costs due primarily to COVID-related utilization curtailment. Rate refunds to a number of our state Medicaid customers and response to the COVID-related utilization curtailment, which we experienced in both the second and third quarters, in increase in our G&A spending on activities related to COVID and a meaningful increase to our Medicaid membership. We experienced several significant COVID-related impacts on medical costs in the quarter. First, at the beginning of the quarter, utilization was still moderately curtailed, but rebounded to more normal levels during the quarter. Second, we attracted approximately 300,000 new Medicaid members to Molina since the end of March. And the acuity of that population is clearly lower than the book of business average. And third, direct costs to care for COVID patients totaled $35 million in the quarter. As a resurgence of COVID infections and episodes has occurred in places including Texas and California and disproportionately impacted the marketplace business. In the quarter, the net effect of these three factors reduced normalize medical costs and increased pre-tax earnings by a range of $95 million to $105 million. As you recall, in the second quarter, six of our state customers enacted temporary rate refunds with the stated intent of recouping the portion of our capitated rates not spent on medical costs due to the pandemic. In some of those states, the refund period extended into the third quarter. In addition, during the quarter one additional state Michigan enacted a refund mechanism. In the third quarter, the total impact from COVID-related rate refunds serve to reduce premium revenue and earnings by $88 million on a pre-tax basis. With respect to rate adequacy, we do not intend nor do we want to keep state Medicaid money that was intended to be spent on medical benefits, but was not due to utilization curtailment caused by COVID. In many of our Medicaid states, there are already mechanisms in place to protect against a surplus margin as there are minimum MLRs in seven of our states and profit caps in two others. And once the COVID-19 pandemic abates, we believe that the traditional process of establishing prospective actuarially sound rates based on a credible medical cost baseline and cost trend off that baseline will resume. COVID-related activity increased our third quarter administrative expense by approximately $7 million. We continue to develop a variety of new operational protocols, technology implementations, and benefits for our employees all related to the COVID pandemic and the related increased volume. Medicaid membership increased sequentially by 473,000 in a quarter, a 15% increase. 325,000 of this increase was directly related to the Passport membership and Kentucky, which we assumed on September 1. The addition of the YourCare membership in New York was almost entirely offset by the expected membership decline from the early stages of our Puerto Rico exit. The remaining 148,000 member increase was primarily due to the suspension of redeterminations. As we believe that unemployment related enrollment has not yet materially accessed managed Medicaid. It remains unclear how high the COVID-related membership peak will be, how quickly it will fall as the economy recovers and where it will ultimately settle. However, it does appear that since unemployment nationally is now just under 8% initial industry estimates of unemployment related Medicaid membership increases were overstated. Relatedly, the declaration of the extension of the public health emergency period and the related maintenance of effort extension into next year will likely have a favorable impact. In summary, as we work through this unprecedented period of the COVID pandemic, we remain focused on executing on the underlying fundamentals of our business to continue to produce solid results, regardless of the short-term COVID-related impacts on our reported financial metrics and results. Now I turn to our guidance for the full year. In September 1, we closed on the Passport acquisition and the Commonwealth of Kentucky novated Passport’s Medicaid contract to Molina. For 2020, the four months of revenue from this transaction will add approximately $700 million of revenue with negligible earnings. This increase combined with higher Medicaid enrollment through the third quarter, supports the increase in our 2020 total revenue guidance to $19.6 billion from the previous estimate of $18.8 billion. This total revenue guidance for 2020 includes $18.6 billion in premium revenue. Our core performance each quarter has been strong and stable producing at or about $3 of earnings per share. Although this core business performance is expected to remain strong through the fourth quarter, we are choosing to maintain our existing guidance. We take this cautious approach because of the continued uncertainty related to COVID impact on medical costs and the possibility for additional COVID-related rate refunds. We further note that the proceeds from the previously announced favorable settlement with respect to the federal risk corridor litigation will be reported in our fourth quarter. Also in the fourth quarter, we intend to make a sizable contribution to our recently launched MolinaCares charitable foundation. These two items will likely offset each other. When we report our fourth quarter, we will certainly focus on providing a clear view of the earnings power of the business as a baseline for gauging the quality of our 2021 earnings guidance. Shifting the discussion now to our growth initiatives, we made another major stride in the quarter related to the activation of our growth strategy. In September, we signed a definitive agreement to purchase Affinity Health Plan of New York for approximately $380 million. The profile of Affinity is perfectly aligned with our philosophy of staying close to our core business. It is a managed Medicaid business in New York City, as well as surrounding counties and is a nice compliment to the Senior Whole Health business that we are acquiring with the Magellan Complete Care acquisition. Affinity serves approximately 284,000 Medicaid members. Its membership base is stable and the company has very good share in the markets it serves. Affinity’s operating infrastructure sound, it has solid provider relationships, a high performing team of enrollment coordinators and a platform, which has the ability to successfully defend and expand its market position. Affinity has not performed to the levels of profitability that Molina has achieved. It therefore provides yet another opportunity for us to bring our operating discipline, business processes and technologies to improve margins and harvest fixed cost leverage with our other New York-based businesses. The transaction is expected to close as early as the second quarter. So the acquisition could provide up to $600 million of revenue for 2021. At a purchase price of less than 30% of reporting revenue, we are projecting excellent returns in excess of our cost of capital. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive by $0.15 to $0.20 adjusted earnings per share in the first 12 months of our ownership. After that initial integration period, we expect to achieve margins consistent with both Molina’s performance track record and the industry norm for the New York metro area. The purchase of Affinity is another milestone in a growth oriented 2020. Our growth initiatives continued to be anchored by our capital allocation priorities. First, organic growth of our core businesses, second, inorganic growth through accretive acquisitions, and third programmatically returning excess capital to shareholders. We previously provided you with a 2021 premium revenue outlook. This outlook included a pro forma estimate of the revenue associated with our announced acquisition of Magellan Complete Care, which is on track to close around the end of the year and an estimate of the revenue expected from auto assigned membership and our new Kentucky Medicaid contract. That outlook, which included only a modest early estimate of organic growth, was 2021 premium revenue of $21.5 billion. This 2021 outlook has improved now that we are currently serving all of Passport’s existing membership in Kentucky, the majority of which we are expecting to keep. Our expectation is not affected by a court ruling last Friday that a sixth player should be added to the Kentucky Medicaid program for 2021. That ruling did not rescind our Medicaid contract award, does not impact the earlier novation of the Passport Medicaid contract to us and does not affect our status as a current incumbent in the program. Our 2021 outlook has also improved the announcement of the Affinity acquisition. We will provide refined revenue guidance with all the supporting details, when we announce our 2021 full year guidance. There was so much activity related to the political arena, legislative actions and judicial review that we feel obligated to provide some brief commentary on these topics. We have no new perspective to add on the upcoming election, except to say, that all of the most likely potential political outcomes are generally positive for managed Medicaid and related government subsidized programs, although, some political scenarios are more favorable than others. On the legislative front, the recently announced expansion of the COVID public health emergency is likely a positive indicator for continued membership gains and to provide more support for an actuarially sound rate environment. Much has been written and discussed regarding the Affordable Care Act case that is scheduled to be argued before the Supreme Court on November 10. We believe that even if the court were to find the individual mandate to be unconstitutional, it should nevertheless find the individual mandate to be separable from the balance of the law, both as a matter of logic and based on the clear intent of the 2017 Congress, which zeroed out the individual mandate tax penalty. It is also clear as a factual matter that the marketplace business can function effectively without any penalty for failure to purchase health insurance. Regardless of the Supreme Court’s ruling, we believe there is a high likelihood of a legislative fix to the law before any final legal opinion would go into effect. As I conclude my remarks, I offer another heartfelt thank you to our management team and our 10,000 associates for delivering excellent results, while dealing with their own stresses and life challenges. Even when facing these challenges, our associates are inspired and motivated by the opportunity to make positive change by delivering high quality healthcare to the country’s most vulnerable populations. Our associates continue to excel and I stand in admiration of their dedication and desire to serve our membership base, during these most challenging times. In conclusion, this was yet another meaningful quarter for the company. We are pleased with our third quarter performance, especially, in light of the turbulence caused by the COVID pandemic. We took major steps forward in our transformation. We sustained our margins and did right by our members and customers. We continue to execute on our revenue growth strategy and deployed excess capital in strategic acquisitions. This strong performance points to a very bright future. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for some additional color on the financials. Tom?
Tom Tran: Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. I am going to provide highlights of our financial results for the quarter and then discuss our balance sheet, cash flow, 2020 guidance and 2021 outlook. We reported GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.10 and adjusted earnings per share of $3.36, representing 13% and 19% growth respectively over the same period in 2019. The solid results were supported by premium revenue of $4.8 billion, which grew 17% from the third quarter of 2019 and include 22% year-over-year growth in Medicaid membership, inclusive of the Passport and YourCare acquisitions. As it relates to the COVID-19 impact by line of business, COVID reduce the Medicaid MCR by approximately 90 basis points and the Medicare MCR by approximately 130 basis points. However, COVID related impacts increase a marketplace MCR by approximately 310 basis points. Overall, the impact of COVID on third quarter earnings was negligible to slightly positive. The G&A ratio improves and came in at 7.3% compared to 7.6% in a prior year due to the fixed cost leverage we created from the increase in revenue, offset somewhat by increase in COVID specific costs and the integration of Passport. Now, turning to balance sheet and cash flow. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and our reserve position remained strong. Days in claim payable represent 52 days of medical cost expense compared to 52 days in the second quarter of 2020 and 50 days in the third quarter of 2019. Prior year reserve development for the third quarter of 2020 was negligible, as was the case with a comparable period in 2019. Operating cash flow for the nine months of 2020 was $591 million, reflecting the strong operating results and the timing of government receipts and payments. We extract $120 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, which brought our parent company cash balance to $1.3 billion and give us ample capacity to fund our recent acquisitions and organic growth initiatives. Debt at the end of the quarter is 1.6 times trailing 12-month EBITDA. Our leverage ratio is 48.2%. However, on a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, the leverage ratio is 25.8%. Taken together, these metrics reflect a conservative leverage position. Our unsecured debt rating was recently upgrade by two notch to Ba3 by Moody’s, a recognition of our operating performance, growth prospects and financial strength. As of September 30, 2020, our health plans has statutory capital and surplus of approximately $2.2 billion, which equates to approximately 365% of risk-based capital. Now turning to our 2020 guidance. We increase our full year 2020 total revenue guidance to approximately $19.6 billion from $18.8 billion, mainly due to the completion of the Passport acquisition in Kentucky and the novation of its Medicaid contract to Molina on September 1. As previously noted, we are maintaining our existing earnings guidance. Let me provide more color on the reasons for this cautious approach. First, while we have enclosed all known COVID related rate refunds in our guidance, additional rate refunds be enacted, such refunds would have a more disproportionate impact in the fourth quarter because of their retroactive nature. And second, there remains a level of uncertainty about COVID itself and/or related medical cost increase or decrease that could occur. If you recall, in the second quarter, we report approximately $190 million to $240 million of net COVID related medical cost decrease due to utilization curtailment. And in this third quarter, medical cost curtailment was $95 million to $105 million. We have been averaging $12 million to $13 million a month in COVID direct costs of care. How these many dynamics play out in a fourth quarter is a matter of significant uncertainty. As Joe mentioned previously, our core performance each quarter has been strong and stable producing at or above $3 of earnings per share. And our business performance is expect to remain strong through the fourth quarter. We will remind investor of the seasonality of the marketplace NCR and higher open enrollment expenses in both the Medicare and marketplace businesses in the fourth quarter. When we report our fourth quarter results, we will provide a clear picture of the run rate of the business, excluding the distortions cost by COVID, all with a goal of presenting a clear baseline off of which to gauge our 2021 guidance. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: Yes. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets.
Matthew Borsch: Hi. Thank you. I was just hoping maybe you could elaborate a little bit further on the pressure factors in the marketplace business. And I guess, I’m a little surprised just because I was unaware of that 300 basis point increase in the MCR there maybe you can parse that out. That would be fantastic.
Joe Zubretsky: Sure. Obviously in producing an 81% MCR for the quarter, we clearly underperformed. But 300 basis points of that was directly related to COVID. And it’s all geography based. We have, as you know, a significant amount of membership in Texas, there was a COVID spike in Texas, and it’s certainly impacted our marketplace business. But even with an ex-COVID MCR of 78%, we underperformed. We’ve analyzed it thoroughly. It’s related to the bronze product. Silver product is performing fine. And we think we’re well priced and well positioned and product design and price. We underperformed on two very important operating levers and that is utilization control and the ability to attract and record appropriate risk scores commensurate with the acuity of that population. We have those disciplines in place for our other products and our other businesses through various organizational design issues. We have not yet excelled at those two operating disciplines in the marketplace business and we’ll fix that the way we fixed everything else over the last couple of years.
Matthew Borsch: And if I could just ask, given maybe where you’re expecting the full year margin to land for the marketplace businesses. Is that above or below what you would view as sort of target sustainable?
Joe Zubretsky: It will likely be below. As you know, a couple of years ago, the last time we gave you long-term targets is that our Investor Day, where we suggested that the long-term after tax margin for the marketplace business was 8.5% to 9.5%. We’re certainly backing off that long-term target. This is a mid-single-digit business, but the likely to underperform after the year, but I think that’s where our long-term margin expectation will lie mid-single-digits.
Matthew Borsch: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.
Kevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. Maybe just to follow-up on that. So I guess, when we think about the business for 2021, you’re saying – it sounds like you’re saying that you’re not worried about the pricing for this business in 2021, that even though costs are up, you’ve priced appropriately, it’s really just operational changes that need to be made for next year. And you should get that business back to normal next year.
Joe Zubretsky: That is correct. In that bronze product, our bronze mix is slightly higher this year than last. And the bronze membership actually had a higher churn. And as you know, when you attract a new member, you’re always starting with a risk score of one in new members. They haven’t interacted with the healthcare system yet. So you need to work really hard at making sure, you get the right risk scores. So the fact that higher percentage that membership was new and our bronze mix is slightly higher. Product is adequately priced, product design and our zero-based – our zero premium products are in the right geographies. We’re well positioned for next year. The companion question is, did you consider all this and the pricing that you filed recently? The answer is yes. We filed prices that included a very conservative pre-COVID medical cost baseline and reasonably conservative trends off that baseline. So our view, this is not a pricing issue. This is a performance issue, and we plan to get that back next year.
Kevin Fischbeck: Okay, great. And then just to confirm some of the numbers that you mentioned on COVID, the $95 million to $105 million number. Was that a gross number? I think you saw $30 million of COVID costs. Is the $95 million to $105 million net about $30 million or should we think about that as a gross benefit [indiscernible] $30 million offset.
Joe Zubretsky: No. You’re correct. That’s net. The gross range of costs curtailment due to the pandemic was $130 million to $140 million and direct costs related to COVID were $35 million, producing the net range of $95 million to $105 million.
Kevin Fischbeck: Okay. But the $95 million to $105 million is on the same basis as the $190 million to $240 million you mentioned last quarter.
Joe Zubretsky: That is correct. The estimates we gave in the second quarter were net of their direct inpatient medical costs related to COVID.
Kevin Fischbeck: All right. Perfect. Thank you.
Joe Zubretsky: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead, Mr. Rhyee, your line is live. All right. Well, moving on the next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.
Justin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. First question on state to be margin corridors and state rebasing. Joe, can you – I think you said, margin corridors first little over $80 million this quarter, in terms of payback numbers. Do you have an estimate for the full year on both margin corridors and rebasing? And how you’re thinking about that going into next year?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure. Well, just to recap the entire year, $75 million when we reported the second quarter due to six enacted retroactive rate refunds all clearly contained and related to COVID curtailment. That same number for the third quarter with $88 million, meaning we’ve incurred $163 million year-to-date. The third quarter number included one additional state, Michigan that introduced a refund mechanism. And many of those corridors and refund mechanisms extended to the fourth quarter. We haven’t disclosed exactly what that number is and obviously depends on a lot of other profitability factors, but various of those mechanisms do extend into the fourth quarter and we’ll report that number against the COVID curtailment, just the way we did in the second and the third quarters. Long-term, we are very comfortable at the time tested mechanism of prospective rate development off a credible cost baseline and a reasonable trend off that baseline will resume. These refund mechanisms are clearly related to the recruitment of money that was paid to us with the full intention of us, paying it out to members and benefits and due to COVID that level of utilization didn’t occur. So again, very contained, very specific, all related to COVID, when all that the pandemic abates, we believe that the system will function as intended and as time tested process of prospective rate development will resume.
Justin Lake: Thanks. And then Joe, when you think about these members, who have the growth in membership, that’s come from the lack of churn in this [indiscernible] I don’t think any of us know, when the federal government is take off the federal emergency status and these members will start being reverified. But I’m curious, as you think into 2021, whenever that does happen. Do you have a view on how these members kind of move off Medicaid, how long it takes for the state steady verify?
Joe Zubretsky: It’s a really interesting question, because we have begun conversations with many of our state customers about the prospects of moving members, who are no longer eligible for Medicaid, but we’re on it due to the redetermination paws, how they will move them off. Obviously, and not for revenue reasons, we’re not suggesting that they do it in a stage process for revenue generating reasons. But for the lack of tumult and lack of churn and the disruption, it will create for members who are on Medicaid and are suddenly taken off. So we’re certainly arguing and in support of a more staged approach, but our state customers are still deliberating in terms of whether they’re going to turn the switch off immediately or whether they’re going to face this over time, which again, causes yet another variable. And what the redetermined – member redetermined patient-based revenue will look like for 2021. How fast those members roll off is still yet to be determined.
Justin Lake: Great. Thank you, Joe.
Joe Zubretsky: You’re welcome, Justin.
Operator: Thank you. And next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies.
Dave Styblo: Hi, good morning. It’s Dave Styblo in for Windley. I was hoping you could talk Joe a little bit more about how you think about the both margin profile for Kentucky in year one. Usually, margins on a new contract are well below the target or even negative earnings in that first period. However, does it considerably help you that you’ll have an existing platform via the Passport acquisition that might allow you to earn something closer to your target margins for all of your Kentucky business in the first year?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure. Well, when it comes to our acquisitions, we certainly and the extensive due diligence that we perform. We certainly able to give our investors a clear view of the early accretion, as we’ve done on Magellan and as we just did on Affinity. When it came to Passport, it was a different model. We actually were buying into a membership base, a revenue stream, not necessarily an earnings stream. So we view Kentucky as sort of a hybrid between a new installation and the integration of a business. Now, as you know, the Passport earnings margin profile was not where Molina has operated in the past. So it’s going to take some time to get it there. So we’re going to be very cautious with our early estimate of how much – how many dollars of earnings will flow off the Kentucky Medicaid business in the first year. And when we report our 2021 guidance, we’ll certainly have a reasonable estimate at that time. But right now, we are in full mode of analyzing Passport and integrating it due to the contract novation we have getting ready for open enrollment. All those processes are fully in motion. But it’s too early to actually have a point estimate on the first year. But I will say that the Passport acquisition clearly allowed us to avoid a lot of the very expensive startup costs that are normally associated with a new contract.
Dave Styblo: Got it. Thanks. And then just a follow-up on the parent cash. Can you give us some sense of a roll forward over the next year. So obviously, you’ve got a couple of acquisitions that you have to pay for, but how we should think about that cash balance towards the end of next year. So we can gauge a little bit more about your propensity to an appetite for acquisitions of these assets that you’d like to have a bolt-on such as Affinity.
Joe Zubretsky: The way to think about the capital model goes something like this. You can look at our forecasted earnings and except for the amount of capital that one would need to reserve and it’s regulated subsidiaries to fund organic growth, which averages between 8% and 10% of premium. That cash flow ought to be able to be extracted in the form of dividends from our operating subsidiaries. Once it’s brought to the parent company, you can put leverage on it and pick a leverage ratio of 50%, you can double your capacity. So earnings less retained capital for organic growth ought to be dividend to the parent doubled the size of it for debt capacity. And that gives your sort of view of how much free cash flow you have available for acquisitions and other activities.
Dave Styblo: Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research.
Josh Raskin: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. First question is just around utilization patterns. And if you feel like towards the end of the quarter, you were back to whatever normal is supposed to look like our baseline, and maybe a progression to the quarter as well as an early view on October.
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, Josh. At the beginning of the quarter, we still had the curtailment effect in place and that sort of evaporated as the quarter moved on. Now, I will tell you that toward the end of the quarter, when the infection rate in many of our geographies and across the nation spikes, we saw a reaction to that. We’re learning a lot about consumer behavior and about how the healthcare economy works and how reactive it is. It’s very reactive to the COVID infection rate, both in the number of hospitalizations we have directly related to COVID and how quickly elective and discretionary procedures begin to wane when the COVID infection rate is reported. So the healthcare economy is very responsive to that infection rate. And towards the end of the quarter, we saw it spike back a little bit. Not commenting on October at this point, but as I said, it’s very, very responsive. And the fact that we’re now seeing a resurgence of COVID, I believe, will impact the fourth quarter. You’ll see more COVID related costs, and I believe you’ll see the shadow effect of continued curtailment.
Josh Raskin: Perfect. And then just second question, as you think about 2021, you guys gave some visibility into a revenue number last quarter. It sounds like, you’re updating it to be just simply larger. Is there any major difference expected between the top line and bottom line? I just want to make sure I’m not missing something. It sounds like Passport kind of maybe a little bit lower than typical earnings. But just want to make sure there’s no – there’s nothing brought, I’m missing that large acquired books aren’t going to be similar margins, when you think about the synergies, et cetera.
Joe Zubretsky: Well, ultimately, the premise of your question is correct. We plan to get these to our target margins, producing 6%, 6.5% EBITDA margins depending on the geography, we plan to get them there. We gave the accretion numbers for Magellan. We just gave them, at least the first 12 months for Affinity. And I would say, you’re right, on Kentucky, given that it’s a hybrid between an installation and the integration of a non-for-profit plan. I would not giving you a forecast, but I would say that in the first year, that is likely not to perform to our target margin.
Josh Raskin: All right. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Sarah James of Piper Sandler.
Sarah James: Hi, thank you. I appreciate the commentary on the payback situation in multiple States in Medicaid. And I’m wondering if that also indicates that Medicaid margins are operating near peak. Then if you layer on the lower long-term tax margin guidance, I’m wondering if the right number for the total co is still the 3.8% to 4.2%, that you gave it last I-Day. Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Let me comment on our margin performance, vis-à-vis the long-term targets and you’re absolutely right. The last time we updated this, which is now some time ago. We gave you a long-term target of 3.8% to 4.2% and we just produced a quarterly margin of 3.7%, which had somebody you have recognized falls just slightly out of that range. I will remind you that 3.8% to 4.2% included a marketplace target of 8.5% to 9.5%, which were clearly going to come off of that’s going to land in mid-single-digits, not picking a point estimate now. So the fact that we’re actually able to produce 3.7% after tax, when the marketplace this quarter was breakeven. I think we’re still in the strike zone of our long-term targets, even though, we can pullback our projection of what the marketplace business will produce. And the fact that we’re not the chatter two years ago, and it was legitimate was that our financial profile was over-relying – over reliance on marketplace revenues and profits. That’s certainly not the case anymore, but if we can produce, our long-term part of margins having pulled back our marketplace estimates, I think that’s certainly bodes well for the future.
Sarah James: And then on the bronze hicks, but last quarter you guys talked about COVID creating some challenges or delays in getting the adjusted risk scores. I’m just wondering if you learned anything from this year’s process that makes you more optimistic about the new members that come on next year and the pace at which you might get them scored.
Joe Zubretsky: Yes, I mean the entire industry is facing the same challenges. As you know in order to get the right codes and the right interventions, people need to go to the doctor. And when they stopped going to the doctor and the hospital, you don’t have the data to support their risks. Some of these require face-to-face interventions. We have a fantastic arm of our business with nurse practitioners and visit patients in their home. They were unable to do that for a long period of time. So we’re sort of facing the same headwind that the rest of the industry is facing with respect to the attainment of risk scores. But as the economy opens up as people get back into the field, again we think this will come back quickly. We know how to get them. We know how to chase the charts, get the codes. And when the world returns to normal movements in consumer activity, we believe this thing snaps back into place. As you know the marketplace business reacts quickly to risk adjustment to immediate Medicare like one year delayed and Medicaid two years delayed. So there’s a lag effect. But we believe as the world comes back to normal, we’ll be able to get our metrics back to where they need to be as well the rest of the industry.
Sarah James: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens.
Scott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. First question, just interested in Joe, I know you talked about how you’re comfortable with the pricing for 2021 and with your exchange products as it relates to the bronze. Just interested in how you’re looking at the overall market pricing environment for the marketplace for next year and how competitive you see that and how that positions you for growth in that market next year given some of the pricing that you’re taking on your own book of business
Joe Zubretsky: Sure. There are some new entrants that have entered some of our states, but you know who the big competitors are. We operate at a much different level than many of our competitors that we are going after the highly subsidized members who perhaps just earn a little more money than that would qualify them for Medicaid and we’re leveraging our Medicaid network. So we’re in a slice of the market that’s heavily dependent on the federal subsidy. We think we can grow the pool of profits, trust management to pick the right geographies, push price and ease up on membership or to ease on price to push membership. We’ll make those judgments geography by geography, depending on the strength of the competition, the strength of our network. And we believe as we always have that we can grow the pool of profits. Obviously we’ll be growing it off of a smaller base, even our performance this year, but we’re still pretty confident we can do that.
Scott Fidel: Got it. And then just on my follow-up question, why don’t you just ask maybe a little conceptually about how you’re thinking about the New York market and confidence in the rate in regulatory environment when we think of that longer-term, clearly you’ve been deploying a meaningful amount of capital into New York. And from a bottoms up perspective, these are all deals that very much are attractive and fit the Molina profile. At the same time, obviously New York does have some larger long-term budget gaps relative to a lot of other states that are rejected. So just obviously I know that you think about the top down as well so interested in how you’re evaluating just the broader market dynamics.
Joe Zubretsky: Well, fair point. And obviously, you’re always balancing those dynamics against where the population is. And if you want to be in the Medicaid business, you can’t ignore places like California and New York where the Medicaid population live. So clearly a New York Metro is a place we want it to be. We have a nice blend of business there now. We have a traditional Medicaid business with the purchase of affinity, and we have a managed long-term care business with the purchase of senior whole health in New York. And you’re right. New York is clearly has budget pressures and lots of other factors that are indigenous to New York. But in buying these properties and projecting the earning stream off of which they’re valued, we certainly took all of that into consideration. So when you’re an incumbent, those things happen, you might have some issues, but when you’re contemplating all those puts and takes, when you’re valuing a property in order to buy it, we’re pretty comfortable that we pay for them correctly. We considered all the puts and takes that could happen in both New York Metro and the State of New York. And we’re very comfortable that these are going to create long-term value with the accretion numbers we’ve given.
Scott Fidel: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.
George Hill: Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I guess, Joe, circling back to the Texas exchange and Medicaid issues. Are you able to call out what types of utilization that you guys saw that drove the MLR up? And I guess what I’m looking for are kind of any consistencies or correlation that, that might – I guess that might kind of rear its head in the future or kind of maybe even more color on what makes you think that this is kind of a contained issue that’s readily fixable.
Joe Zubretsky: Sorry, George, I couldn’t hear the first part of your question. Which business were you referring to?
George Hill: The broad business, the exchange business.
Joe Zubretsky: And we try to be very clear and transparent if we have an operating issue that didn’t meet our expectations, but I think we need to put a box around this. Our entire marketplace business is 8% of our total revenue and to bronze business is about a quarter of the total marketplace business. It did underperform, but this is boxed, it’s contained, it’s identified, it’s clearly related to operational performance. And we fixed so many operating protocols, introduced so many different performance improvement initiatives over the past couple of years. We’re going to fix this. Again, when you look at where it is and how much of the company’s profile, it actually consumes, it is a very contained, easy to fix issue. So I don’t want to have this painted with a broad brush, because it’s very specific and very contained.
George Hill: Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow-up to the question that Justin asked earlier. I don’t know if you guys quantify this, but have you talked about what percent of the membership in Medicaid that you think is at risk of falling off when redeterminations resume?
Joe Zubretsky: No, we haven’t. We continue to see the redetermination pause. Last quarter, we broke protocol by giving an inner quarter update. I’ll do the same now. We saw more membership increase in October. I think the number of increase is slightly over 30,000 in the month of October so far. Now that will be offset by our Puerto Rico exit. But in terms of new members coming on through redetermination, it continues into the quarter. But no, as we said in our prepared remarks, how high does the people be, how far – how quickly it will fall off as the economy approves. And to the point someone made earlier, how will the states actually unwind this in a staged approach or in a sudden approach is still yet to be determined. So no, we have not given any impact of this on our revenue forecast either for the balance for 2021. It certainly increased our revenue outlook for the rest of the year.
George Hill: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Stephen Tanal with SVB Leerink.
Stephen Tanal: Good morning, guys. Thanks for so much detail today. I guess I’ll just do quick ones that, I don’t know if I missed this, but I don’t think you commented on the risk corridor settlement funding. I think you expected to get about $128 million. Is that still accurate and any plans for that money?
Joe Zubretsky: Yes, that is accurate. We received it, $128 million pre-tax. It will be reported in the fourth quarter. And we are likely to have an offsetting amount in the quarter where we will be making a sizable contribution to our new 501(c)(3) charitable trust called the MolinaCares cord foundation. So likely a wash in the quarter when we report the fourth quarter, but yes, $128 million was the pre-tax number. And much of that will be deposited or contributed, I should say to our 501(c)(3) trust.
Stephen Tanal: Great, helpful. Thanks, Joe. And then maybe one last one for me, the Ohio rebid just wanted to get your major sort of confidence there and the likelihood of success. Is there an ability to take share? Any commentary there would be helpful.
Joe Zubretsky: Well, we have – we run a fine business in Ohio with 12%, 15% market share. We’re well-positioned across the entire state. And obviously we have our A team on this to key state for us. And we’re very confident that we’ll submit a high quality proposal. That’ll be scored well. But it’s a re-procurement and we’ll submit it on November 20 when it’s due. And when the announcement comes out, we’ll certainly report that, but we have our ATM on this. We run a great business there. And we have every reason to believe we’ll be successful. And not only retaining, but perhaps even expanding.
Stephen Tanal: Got it. There’s an opportunity. Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.
Gary Taylor: Hi, good morning. Thanks for all the detail and the transparency. Most of my questions were answered. So I’ll just ask a couple of little farther down the list. Just going back to Kentucky Passport, what are the applications though of adding the six player? Will there just be auto assignments and we just take a sixth off your expected membership or is it unclear how the allocations will be made at this point?
Joe Zubretsky: It’s unclear. And we don’t want to get ahead of our customer on this one, because they have the jurisdiction over how to allocate in a portion membership. But yes, that’s the way we’re thinking about it. We are an incumbent. We’re servicing 320,000 members today as we sit here today through the Passport brand, out of the Molina Healthcare, Kentucky legal entity. And when you introduce a six player, if in fact that’s what’s done, we believe the state will have to go through some process of reapportioning members. How that’s done through auto assignment through or judgment. We just don’t know, and we don’t want to speculate, but that is the practical implication of that ruling that was made last Friday introduction of the six player, which will have to be a portion membership.
Gary Taylor: Okay. My one other is just thinking about when you looked at the COVID impact on your exchange business and you geographically called out Texas, if we look at the positive net benefit of COVID and care deferrals on your Medicaid MLR, would you similarly call out California as a geography that disproportionately benefit? Or is there anything else to say about the geography on the Medicaid MLR?
Joe Zubretsky: The reason that it’s less pronounced on the Medicaid MLRs, it’s a more diversified book of business in 15 states. So no, I mean there’s California was certainly a pressure point in all of our businesses with COVID as was Texas. But it’s just less pronounced in Medicaid just because of the geographic diversification that we have.
Gary Taylor: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is another time from Charles Rhyee with Cowen.
Charles Rhyee: Hi, can you guys hear me? Hello.
Joe Zubretsky: Yes, perfectly.
Charles Rhyee: Okay. Yes, sorry about that earlier. Similarly I think I got through most of my questions here. I just wanted to follow-up maybe Joe, when you were talking about the 2021 outlook here, obviously some of your peers have been speaking a little bit more cautiously. I think you’ve obviously given some very solid targets and a positive outlook here. Any other additional comments you could add maybe in terms of what other areas and maybe conservatism that you’re thinking about building in as you’re approaching guidance maybe relative to prior years given sort of – given the heightened higher uncertainties that we’re in here any other puts or takes that we should take into account, obviously take into account all the other comments you made earlier. Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: No, I think the actually the word you use to ask the question are actually reflective of the situation. There’s clearly more uncertainty and risks to consider. As you move from this very intentive COVID pandemic into what may be a less intentive COVID pandemic environment. But all the puts and takes on managing a managed Medicaid business are certainly in play. It’s –what is the medical cost baseline look like for next year? How it will be influenced by COVID either increased or decreased by direct COVID or COVID curtailment. And then how that cost baseline is reflected in rates. We have good visibility into our rates at this early stage. We are for 2021 revenue base, we know about – we know the rates and about 40% of the revenue base at this point. When we give guidance in February, we’ll understand the rates and about 70% of our revenues. So we’ll have good visibility into that. And the conversations we’re having with our state customers are very balanced. They’re actuarially sound. They’re based on reasonable cost baselines. But to me, the big issues that you always consider going into a year when you’re trying to forecast earnings is medical cost projection, and how rates will be reflective of that medical cost baseline. And those certainly are the two issues that have to be considered as you look forward to next year. Not to mention the accretion that we’re going to produce from the recent acquisitions that we’ve integrated.
Charles Rhyee: Great. That’s helpful. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. And as there are no further questions, that does conclude today’s question-and-answer session, as well as a conference call. Thank you so much for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-31 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Molina Healthcare Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Trudell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Molina Healthcare. Please go ahead.
Julie Trudell: Good morning and welcome to Molina Healthcare's second quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Tom Tran. A press release announcing our second quarter earnings was distributed yesterday after the market closed and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of the call, a replay of this call will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made herein are as of today Friday, July 31, 2020, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our second quarter 2020 press release. During our call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic environment, recent acquisitions, 2020 guidance, and our longer term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K Annual Report for the 2019 year filed with the SEC, as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and our Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to take your questions. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?
Joseph Zubretsky: Thank you, Julie, and good morning. Today, we would like to provide you with updates on a number of topics. First, we will cover the enterprise-wide financial results for the second quarter; second and relatedly, we will discuss the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on various aspects of our business; third, we will convey our guidance in the context of our second quarter results and this new but temporary operating environment; and fourth and lastly, we will provide a premium revenue growth outlook for 2021 which is approximately 20% as we now emerge from pivoting to growth to activating our growth phase. Let me start with specific second quarter highlights. Last night we reported earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of $4.65 with net income of $276 million. These results were supported by an MCR of 82.3%, a G&A ratio of 7.5% and an after tax margin of 6%. Our year-to-date earnings per diluted share is now $7.54 representing 66% of our full-year guidance. The COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on many aspects of our quarterly results. Some of these impacts increased earnings while others served to decrease earnings. While many of these impacts are known and estimable, others require significant judgment to estimate. Today, we will do our best to quantify the COVID impacts on our results and separate them from the underlying core earnings power of the business. In doing so, two things are clear. Our operating metrics were substantially in line with our expectations, both as reported and as adjusted for COVID impacts and both our core earnings and the growth trajectory of our business have not been disrupted by the short-term impacts of COVID. We estimate that taken together all COVID impacts on our financial results for the quarter resulted in an increase in net income in a range of $65 million to $100 million, equating to an increase in earnings per diluted share in a range of $1.10 to $1.65. Now I will provide some highlights related to our second quarter results from an enterprise perspective. Beginning with revenue, our premium revenues of $4.1 billion increased by 8% over the prior year. Relatedly, our membership increased sequentially by 151,000 members or 4% primarily in Medicaid. With respect to medical costs with an 82.3% MCR our performance was also strong, although significantly augmented by COVID impacts. Although in many cases we were required to relax our utilization management and payment integrity regimes as an accommodation to providers. We continue to effectively manage medical costs while ensuring all of our members receive high-quality care. This MCR result was impacted by two directionally different factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We experienced lower than expected medical costs due to COVID related utilization curtailment, a phenomenon that may or may not recur during the balance of the year and a number of our state Medicaid customers enacted retroactive rate refunds. In the quarter the lower medical costs and the retroactive rate refunds combined to reduce our reported medical care ratio by an estimated 300 to 400 basis points, which account for substantially all of the reduction in the ratio both year-over-year and sequentially. All of the COVID impacts on our second quarter results will be describe in more detail in a few moments. Next, we continued to effectively manage our administrative costs through productivity gains and fixed cost leverage, producing a G&A ratio of 7.5%. This is despite spending on specific COVID related items, which temporarily increased our administrative spending. Our net investment income usually not in earnings item with significant variability was again unusually low at $18 million compared to $34 million a year ago due to the current low interest rate environment. Our line of business results were very much in line with our expectations with strong metrics in both Medicaid and Medicare, while our marketplace results were slightly lower than expected due to a higher than expected member acuity mix. Finally in the quarter, we continued to improve our capital structure. We issued $800 million of high-yield bonds used to retire short-term floating rate debt. We also upsized our revolver to $1 billion from its previous level of $500 million. These are more than mere transactions. They are the culmination of a two-year long and highly successful restructuring and optimization of our capital structure. We are now positioned with well priced debt, nicely lathered [ph] maturities, solid credit metrics and ample dry powder to execute on M&A opportunities if and when those opportunities arise. In summary, we continued to perform well across the many fundamentals of managed care, which has been our hallmark and we are continuing to grow revenue as a result of our focus on topline growth. Now, I will provide some commentary about the effects of COVID on our second quarter results. The COVID impacts on our quarterly results include, a decrease in medical costs due to COVID related utilization curtailment, offset by direct care related to COVID patients. Retroactive rate refunds to a number of our state Medicaid customers, an increase in our G&A spending on activities related to COVID and a meaningful increase to our Medicaid membership. As previously mentioned, we estimate that taken together all COVID impacts on our financial results for the quarter, have produced an increase in net income in a range of approximately $65 million to $100 million, equating to an increase in earnings per diluted share in a range of $1.10 to $1.65. I will now provide more color on the most significant factors contributing to this. With respect to the COVID impacts on medical costs, early in the quarter we experienced significantly lower utilization in a variety of cost categories, categories representing approximately two thirds of our total spend with utilization levels increasing slowly as the quarter progressed. By the end of the quarter, utilization in these categories were still approximately 10% lower than we would have normally expected. The medical cost categories most impacted were elective surgeries, services in ambulatory settings, ER visits, behavioral services and wellness and preventive services. We also incurred a direct cost to care for COVID patients with just over 4100 hospitalizations and average inpatient episode cost of $9000 plus the cost of outpatient and other professional services. The cost per COVID episode varies widely depending on the acuity of the patient. We estimate that COVID lowered our second quarter medical costs by $190 million to $240 million. As you know, as a general matter, there are fewer elective procedures performed under the Medicaid program than is the case with commercial health insurance. Since our book of business is heavily weighted to Medicaid, the effect on us of elective procedure curtailment is therefore less pronounced. Six of our state customers enacted temporary retroactive rate refunds during the quarter, with the intent of recouping the portion of our capitated rates not spent on healthcare services due to the pandemic. In the quarter these refunds amounted to $75 million pretax and related to the states of Ohio, Illinois, California, South Carolina, Mississippi, and Washington. Some items of note. The refunds in these states took various forms ranging from simple rate adjustment to a slightly more complex risk sharing [indiscernible] around a target medical loss ratio, as well as supplemental payments to providers. In many of our states however, it was business as usual as we continued to operate on the pre-COVID rate structure. Our position on rate adequacy has been consistent. We do not intend, nor do we want to keep state Medicaid money that was intended to be spent on medical benefits or was not due to utilization curtailment caused by COVID. In many of our Medicaid states, there are already mechanisms in place to protect against a surplus margin as there are minimum MLRs in seven of our states and profit caps in two others. The FMAP increase and potential additional FMAP increases should significantly relieve any potential rate pressure in our states and CMS has authority to approve or disapprove proposed rate actions that are not aligned with the definition of actuarial soundness. Once the COVID pandemic abates, we believe that the traditional process of establishing prospective actuarial sound rates based on a credible medical cost baseline and cost trend of that baseline will continue. With respect to our G&A expenses, COVID related activity increased our second quarter expenses by approximately $25 million. A variety of new operational protocols, technology implementations, and benefits for our employees, all related to the COVID pandemic were established or implemented during the quarter. In addition, we have consciously managed our headcount at above optimal levels to ensure we maintain adequate service levels, but also to be socially responsible to our dedicated staff. Medicaid membership increased sequentially by 152,000 members in the quarter, a 5% increase. Much of this was due to the suspension of redeterminations as we believe that unemployment related enrollment has not yet materially accessed managed Medicaid. It remains unclear how high the membership peak will be, how quickly it will be attained, how quickly it will fall as the economy recovers and where it will ultimately settle. We have invested in many local growth initiatives with providers in branding and awareness campaigns and in social media outreach to ensure we obtain our fair share of increased membership. We believe that post COVID Medicaid membership will stabilize at and increased level as the future natural unemployment rate will likely be higher than previously experienced. In summary, as we work through this unprecedented period, we remain focused on executing on the underlying fundamentals of our business regardless of the short term COVID related impacts on our reported financial results. Now I'll turn to our guidance for the full year. Our full year earnings guidance range remains at $11.20 to $11.70 per diluted share with a midpoint of $11.45. Our earnings per share EBITDA [ph] is $7.54, which means through six months we have earned 66% of our revised guidance. Given the environmental uncertainty that we expect to exist through the end of the year, we are not adjusting the range of our previously provided earnings per share guidance. We intend to adjust our full year outlook as appropriate when our third quarter results are reported. The reasons for this cautious approach have always been stated, but bear repeating. The near-term outlook for medical costs, the cost of COVID and the potential elective procedure rebound, are unknown at this time. There is still potential for additional near-term rate actions or voluntary company concessions to customers, members and providers. We will fulfill our obligation to make any rebate to member, CMS or our state customers related to the statutory requirements that exist today. After doing so, if we conclude that there is still a remaining financial imbalance, we will correct that imbalance. Our membership forecast has a wide range of possible outcomes as there are numerous macroeconomic variables in play and relatedly the acuity of any potential membership increase and the cost of services are also highly variable. And lastly, we believe that any methodology for extrapolating annual earnings estimates by quarter should be suspended in ones thinking. I would now like to turn to the progress we have made in executing our growth strategy, which is having an immediate impact and which allows us to forecast premium revenue growth of approximately 20% for 2021. We have essentially checked the box on at least one initiative across all the revenue growth dimensions outlined in our growth strategy. We have retained all of our existing Medicaid contracts. We have won a new state contract and we have executed meaningful and accretive acquisitions. And with the impact of the recession, organic growth would be much better than expected. Some highlights. Based on announced re-procurement schedules, the revenue associated with our current in-force Medicaid contract should be intact through 2021, plus we have significant certainty related to 2022. The new management team has won or defended all of the re-procurements that were under its control. We assumed the YourCare membership on July 1st which will increase membership by 47,000 members in the third quarter, and should provide approximately $140 million of revenue for the remainder of 2020 and $280 million for the full year 2021. The Magellan Complete Care regulatory review process is proceeding as planned. Recall that the Federal antitrust approval is complete and the state approval processes are progressing. We hope to close the transaction by the end of the year and if we do this acquisition will provide the previously announced $2.8 billion of revenue in 2021. For every month the closing would be delayed beyond the first of the year that annual revenue estimate would decrease proportionately. Our Kentucky RFP win will have contracts start date of January 1, 2021. Before considering any of the potential benefits of the Passport acquisition under a conservative set of membership assignment assumptions, the contract should provide at least $850 of revenue in 2021 with upside potential into 2022 as membership organically builds. Organic same-store membership growth, increased product penetration in our nascent Navajo Nation project would also modestly contribute to the 2021 revenue growth rate. Finally, as previously announced, we're exiting the Medicaid business in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. We have reached an agreement to execute an orderly transition of our members to an on-Island competitor. The unwinding will be completed by November 1, and the impact of the transaction itself and the contract exit are not financially material. Under these assumptions, we project 2021 premium revenue of approximately $21.5 billion. We are very pleased with a 20% increase in premium revenue as we move from pivoting to growth to fully activating our top line growth strategy. Another major development in activating our growth strategy was our recently announced transaction to purchase certain Passport assets. The transaction is expected to close before the end of 2020, providing us with a well known brand in Kentucky, a turnkey operation and the opportunity to gain additional membership. Passport represents potential upside to our 2020 and 2021 revenue guidance. The purchase price for Passport is approximately $20 million plus contingent consideration payable in 2021, based on the level of enrollment retained above a certain threshold. A few words about the Passport transaction and its benefits. We will acquire the Passport brand name, all its operating infrastructure, and we will assume approximately 500 highly trained Kentucky based Passport and Evolent employees. The acquisition allows us to enhance operational readiness in advance of our new contract award in Kentucky, and enables continuity of care for Passport members. The acquisition allows us to avoid startup losses, inevitably associated with building a Greenfield health plan, and the early lack of scale. The acquisition allows us to compete more effectively for additional membership above what we might have ordinarily received from the standard auto assignment process related to our own contract award. And from a financial perspective, we expect to recover the purchase price from positive cash flow in less than one year, as the plan would be immediately profitable and is likely to produce membership well above what we might have achieved organically. It is also important to know that the membership revenue in earnings, related to Passport could all commence and begin to impact our results on or about September 1, if the Commonwealth of Kentucky approves our joint request for an early contract novation. This would be a very positive outcome, although it would impact the year-over-year revenue growth rate calculation. As I conclude my remarks. I take a pause from discussing our operating and financial performance and instead, comment on our compassion or humanity. During this unprecedented time, our company made many significant contributions to charitable, and community causes. We offered financial assistance to distressed providers, and worked with our State customers to understand where they saw human tragedies unfold and offered our financial and operational assistance. We will continue to do so. And in fact, we are developing plans to deepen our social commitment to build stronger communities, one life at a time. I offer another heartfelt thank you to our management team, and our 10,000 associates who are executing well while dealing with their own stresses and issues related to the pandemic and racial strife. Even when facing these challenges, our associates are inspired and motivated by the opportunity to make positive change by delivering high quality healthcare to the disadvantaged. Our associates continue to excel and I stand in admiration of their dedication and their will to sacrifice in the face of all types of adversity. In conclusion, this was a meaningful quarter for the company. Our results met our expectations, despite the turbulence caused by the COVID pandemic. We took major steps forward in our transformation. We sustained our margins, but did right by our members and customers. We fully activated our revenue growth strategy and continued to deploy excess capital in strategic acquisitions. This level of performance provides an insightful glimpse into our very bright future. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for some additional color on the financials. Tom?
Thomas Tran: Thank you, Joe and good morning. First, I will comment on our balance sheet, cash flow, and capital. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and reserve positions remain strong. Days in claim payable represent 52 days of medical cost expense, compared to 49 days in the first quarter of 2020, and 48 days in the second quarter of 2019. The sequential increase was driven by lower medical expense in the current quarter, due to the impact of COVID. Reserved development for the first six months of 2020 was negligible compared to favorable development, which decreased our MCR by 110 basis points in the comparable period in 2019. Operating cash flow for the second quarter of 2020 were $630 million, reflecting the strong operating result, and the timing of government receipts and payments. We attract $185 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, which brought our parent company cash balance to $1.2 billion, and give us ample flexibility to fund our recent acquisitions and organic growth initiatives. Debt at the end of the quarter is nearly 1.6 times trolling per month EBITDA. Our leverage ratio is 60.7%. However, on a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, the leverage ratio is only 30.7%. Taken together, these metrics reflect a conservative leveraged position. Our $800 million high yield offering was priced at 4 and 3.8%, indicating that the debt markets view our credit quality at a level that should provide a path for a ratings upgrade in the near future. As of June 30, 2020, our health plans at total statutory capital and surplus of approximately $2.1 billion, which equates to approximately 350% of risk based capital. Now turning to our 2020 guidance. Our full year's earnings guidance range is $11.20 to $11.70 per diluted share. We increased our full year 2020 total revenue outlook to approximately $18.8 billion from $18.3 billion, mainly due to a higher Medicaid enrollment through the first half of the year, as well as revenue from YourCare membership, that is effective July 1, 2020. In taking this cautious approach to providing earnings guidance for the balance of the year, we have considered a wide range of potential outcomes from the factors that Joe previously described. Now I offer some additional items of note. The low yield environment and its drag on investment income should persist in the second half. We are likely to incur additional administrative expenses for COVID related operating protocols. We are also going to incur costs associated with the launch of our new Kentucky contract and integration costs associated with the Magellan Complete Care acquisition. And lastly as a reminder, consistent with our historical practice, previously announced acquisition that have not yet closed are excluded from our guidance. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Justin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. First question just on how you're thinking about the progression of Medicaid membership through the year. I think you added, you said about 4% of membership in the quarter on the Medicaid side. How do you expect to end the year on Medicaid and specifically can you delineate how much of that membership you expect to carve from this lack of disenrollment? And how are you treating that going into 2021 in terms of how you think that kind of - how long that lasts, given the FMAP and the health [ph] emergency status uncertainty?
Joseph Zubretsky: Sure, Justin this is Joe. We grew membership sequentially in Medicaid by 152,000 members at 5%. We believe with really good information that most of that was the result of the suspension of redetermination; that the unemployment surge that is likely to come to manage Medicaid has not yet occurred due to a variety of reasons, spousal coverage, COBRA and backlogs in the various states. Certainly we expect that membership to be on the books for a while. We know it will hit a peak and we also know that as the economy recovers, it will begin to trip [ph]. We do not yet, we have various forecasts of how much membership we are likely to have at the end of the year as a result of all this. But I think we're comfortable in saying that our Medicaid membership will be higher than previously forecasted as a result of COVID. But we have not put a point estimate on that. It's still way too many variables to put a point estimate on how many members we're likely to get. I will say this, through the first three weeks of July the Medicaid membership continued to grow by about 30,000 members organically in the first three weeks of July.
Justin Lake: That's helpful. Thanks for that. And then just last question on the exchange performance. You noted little bit higher costs due to higher acuity, can you flesh that out a little bit for us? And then, should we assume that you were able to catch that early enough for 2021 bids? And any color you can give us in terms of how you're thinking about, where you did, for margins in 2021 and that exchange business that would be helpful? Thanks.
Joseph Zubretsky: Sure. In our marketplace business, our silver bronze mix didn't change all that much. But we did have a churn in the bronze membership we took on, so we had many new members in our bronze product. The MLR ran higher on those numbers than we had expected. It's either higher medical – if you are attracting the right risk or it's either mismanagement of your medical cost line, but if you're managing medical costs effectively, which we think we are, then the risk scores just haven't been commensurate. So we'll catch up and we'll get the risk scores in line with the acuity of the membership. But that's the reason for the small shortfall in our marketplace business for the quarter. With respect to the business, yes we projected a medical costs baseline on COVID impacted use 2019 is the medical costs baseline and then trended forward without any COVID impacts. So we believe that the rates we filed for 2021 are solid, fully contemplated all the costs related to medical services for our members, and the scores that we will attain.
Justin Lake: Great thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Kevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. I wanted to ask about that the rate environment, how should we think about the $75 million number? You characterize it as retroactive? Does that mean that there's not expected to be a go forward impact or is they also a go forward impact on these initiatives in your guidance?
Joseph Zubretsky: Well, the retroactive refunds that we record in the quarter really are a reflection of exactly how the rate apparatus should work. Obviously, rates never contemplated this rather dramatic curtailment in utilization. So whether states enact refunds themselves or whether the minimum MLRs in seven of our States get triggered, the money is rightfully going back to the States because it wasn't spent on benefits for their beneficiaries. So we recorded the retroactive component, either back to in some cases back to March in some cases back to the beginning of the year. And certainly we contemplated the forward looking aspects of those rate decreases and refunds, as we provided our very cautious outlook to the balance of the year. So the 75 million was truly the retroactive component that takes us through June 30, but we certainly contemplated the continuation of those refunds that have already been enacted, and obviously the potential for more actions to be enacted by our State customers.
Kevin Fischbeck: Okay, that's helpful. And then, I guess it was a little bit confusing. It sounded Joe like you were saying that MCC is in your revenue, guidance for 2021. But then Tom mentioned that you don't include deals until they are closed. I just wanted to make sure I understood how the treatment of MCC in that 2021?
Joseph Zubretsky: That's a fair point. I think I'm going to use that as the opportunity to make sure we clarify the outlook we're giving for premium revenue in 2021. First thing, I would say is, you know, our revised forecast for 2020 is $17.8 billion of premium revenue, which is a 10% increase over 2019. That's a pretty strong pivot. Now as we really activate the growth strategy, projecting a 20% growth rate off of 2020 is certainly something we're pleased with. And yes, it does contemplate the Magellan Complete Care acquisition closing on January 1. For every month it would be delayed you can proportionately reduce that. But we expect it to close at the earliest by the end of the year, but no later than the end of the first quarter. We also included the organic component of our Kentucky contract, meaning an amount of revenue in Kentucky that we estimate we would get through the normal auto assignment process. We did not include any potential benefits of additional membership that we'll get through the ownership of the Passport brand and the potential innovation of that contract early in the fall. Also, it's important to note that we've decided to exit Puerto Rico, which leaves $400 million of revenue in 2019 will not be in the 2020 rate, and, of course, a modest, very modest and cautious forecast of organic growth. So that's sort of how we compiled our rather conservative outlook for 2021 and we really wanted to just begin framing the story as we really activate our growth strategy, we wanted to give a forward look, a leading indicator, an outlook of where our revenue line is headed.
Kevin Fischbeck: That's supposed to clarify the last point. My last question here, we say for next year modest organic growth, what are you assuming as far as unemployment next year versus this year?
Joseph Zubretsky: Yes. We have various forecasts on where, as I said, in the previous question, I was asked of where the Medicaid membership will go. And, as I said, we're just we're taking it week-by-week. We - membership grew again in the month of July. We expect it to grow again in August and perhaps through September as that unemployment surge comes through. But it's just so really hard to project. The way I would think about it is, is and what I'm holding my team accountable to, we should do no worse than our market share in those markets. Hopefully, we'll gain market share on this process, but if you take our market share, that would be a good proxy for - if Medicaid enrollment grows by a certain percent we should at least get our market share.
Kevin Fischbeck: That’s great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Matthew Borsch of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Matthew Borsch: Yes, hi. I was hoping maybe you could just elaborate a little bit further on your outlook for Medicaid and the rate actions. I understand you're saying that when we get past COVID-19 that you expect we'll continue to have rates set according to actuarial soundness. But, and also recognize referring to a number of states where already existing risk sharing mechanisms have kicked in, where you have exceeded or I should say, come in well under the medical budget target. But what do you have – if anything to send off at this point, and how are you doing that in terms of states under fiscal pressures? Well, you guys clearly are doing too well with this rate right here, proposals to cut and so forth.
Joseph Zubretsky: Sure. Well, Matt, the conversations with our various day customers have been very balanced and very rational. And they do understand the principle that it has the force of federal law of actuarial soundness, which in the CMS approval process they take very seriously as well. Clearly, the actions that have been taken are related to COVID. That's - that has occupied the conversation. We clearly understand that there are other budget pressures in the states that are causing them to look at Medicaid with a very, very sharp pencil. But you can't recruit money in Medicaid rates to balance your budget. That violates the concept of actuarial soundness. The rates have to reflect that the services that we intend to allow members to have and I think the rate environment will persist through all this. As I said, we'll go back to a point where on a prospective basis, we agreed to statistically credible medical cost baseline, a reasonable trend off that baseline. And, the - that has served managed Medicaid well over many, many years.
Matthew Borsch: Understood. And, I realized that the timing is in different places for different states. But when would you expect to get into the most intense period of discussions over new rate proposals?
Joseph Zubretsky: Well, as you know, our rates contract years span from January 1 to July to September. So we're always in some type of discussion with our customers about rates. And, as we emerge through this COVID period, we have to adjust for the effects of COVID. Are the effects of COVID going to last into the 2021 baseline? Right now, they could, but we just don't know. So I wouldn't want to divulge any particular conversation we're having with states, but the discussion about how long COVID will last, and what that medical cost baseline needs to reflect, is just an ongoing state-by-state discussion.
Joseph Zubretsky: Okay, thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Stephen Tanal of SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.
Stephen Tanal: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question and all the color today. I guess, one thing I wanted to follow up on was just, Joe the $21.5 billion outlook the greater than and as it relates to Kentucky, I just wanted to get a sense of first, I guess, maybe confirm the math. I think if the state approves that you guys can keep Passport 315,000 members it would probably add another billion dollars of premium revenue on top of this outlook based on, how you guys have assumed it right now. So first I want to understand if I have that right, and maybe if there's anything else you can tell us about what Kentucky said so far with respect to whether they'll allow you to keep those numbers in place.
Joseph Zubretsky: Your math is precisely correct. We assumed through an auto assignment process that we’d likely get 140,000 members, which is why we put an estimate of $850 million into our forecast. And we just didn't want to be presumptive. We're buying the Passport operating assets and the brand name. The membership has to be assigned to us through the state approval process. But you're absolutely right. If we obtained all 350,000 members that would represent a little over a $1 billion of upside to the $21.5 billion estimate that we've given you. I will say this, while we're still in the approval process, so I don't want to go into any particular conversations we've had, continuity of care is really, really important to our customers, stability of the network, continuity of the care plans, particularly for the high acuity population is really, really important to our customer. So we believe what one of the potentials for this transaction is to keep either all or many of the 350,000 members that are now in the Passport plan. That was certainly the intention that we had in mind when we bought the Passport assets. So, continuity of care, really, really important to the customer and stability of network, and if we are able to keep many of those members, those objectives will have been met.
Stephen Tanal: Great, that's really helpful. And then I guess just as a follow-up on this point, it sounds like Magellan Complete Care at least inside this initial target is good for about $2.8 billion. Obviously it can move around a little depending on the close, but we can use that and back into I think that, that level of organic growth you spoke to and framed as conservative, I think it's about 5%, correct me if I'm wrong, but how do you think about that 5%? I mean, what is the potential for upside there? And how conservative do you think that is? Maybe talk about where it comes from Medicaid, Medicare, et cetera?
Joseph Zubretsky: We continue to believe that we'll grow our marketplace product. Our DSNP product is doing really, really well. We clearly have plans to grow market share, as I outlined at are Investor Day over a year ago, putting in the operational protocols to make sure that we have less leakage on redetermination than we've had in the past, and that through additional branding and awareness campaigns at the local level, we attract more membership through the voluntary process. Improving our risk scores and our quality scores I should say, to move up higher in the auto assignment algorithms. So we have plans to grow organically. I would call it small bolt-on acquisitions as good as organic, particularly at the prices we're paying. So, I'd stay at the cautious and conservative estimate, and that's the way I would think about it.
Stephen Tanal: Awesome. Maybe if I could just slip in one more, I was just curious to know how much minimum medical loss ratio rebate accruals may dampen the sort of downside of the year on your decline and MCR and maybe same question on premium refund, and I guess prior year development from the roll forward table on a gross basis looks like it was negative in the quarter, so wondering if minimum MLRs were a factor there as well, so maybe any color there would be helpful and then I'll yield thanks.
Joseph Zubretsky: Now, after we recorded the premium refunds, the minimum MLRs did not have any impact in the quarter, no material impact on our financial results. Now going forward, again depends where COVID takes the medical cost line. It depends where the retroactive rate refunds kick-in. But we, again through whatever mechanism there is, we actually prefer and intend to make sure that we don't keep state money that was paid to us for servicing members that wasn’t due to the pandemic. So whether it's through the retroactive rate refund, whether it's through the minimum MLR mechanism or whether it's just voluntary, working with our state customer to make directed payments to providers to add value added benefits for members or just to give them the money back, we think that's the responsible way to behave in a global pandemic with our Medicaid customers.
Stephan Tanal: Helpful, thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Windley: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Joe, a little bit of a followup to the last answer that you just gave, trying to get a sense, you've named I believe, six states that enacted retros, seven have MLR's, two more have profit caps. I guess I'm wondering how much of those, overlap or kind of complement to that question would be, how many states are naked on this issue, how many states do not have a mechanism or have not enacted a mechanism yet to recoup money in this environment?
Joseph Zubretsky: I would say that the states of - the states that haven't yet, are Washington - Washington have directed payments, but no, Washington and Texas, no. Florida and Michigan, have not. New York hasn't. So, those are the states, Wisconsin hasn't. Those are the states that haven't yet, and I don't have the list in front of me of where the MLRs are, but the MLRs are 85 or 86 and those could get tripped and probably in a marginal way, but those are the states that haven't enacted anything yet. And as I said, we'll wait and see, when something's enacted, how they're enacted, what retro period they apply to, et cetera.
David Windley: Sure.
Joseph Zubretsky: But that's the, that's the outlook.
David Windley: Got it. I appreciate that. And just, just thinking, I guess, wondering how states fiscal years and their budget balancing activity come into play in their thinking, in your negotiations. If - if they don't have or don't enact a mechanism to recoup that money in the 2020 fiscal year, does that increase the likelihood that they try to take that out in rates in 2021? Understanding your comments about actuarial soundness, not sure how those would - is that - is that explicitly a year by year thing or could that take into account, kind of a two-year forecast in the way they're looking at that actuarial soundness level?
Joseph Zubretsky: Well, certainly we have, we follow very, very closely all of the budget and legislative activity with our state customers. Obviously, it gives you a sense of hope, repeat their budgets are with tax revenues or not, so we certainly follow it. Many of our states have already passed budgets, many of them passed budgets a year ago that are two years in duration, where we haven't had any conversations about rates. But many are in the process. Certain of them are in process. So we certainly keep our eye on it, but as I said before, you can't use Medicaid rates to recoup tax revenues. They have to reflect the services that you intend to pay for members. And as I said on the last earnings call, there is no question that as the economy moves up and down and state budgets are either very strong or on the weaker side, then rates would be on the stronger side of actuarial soundness when the economy is really robust, and might be on the weaker side of actuarial soundness when the economy is flat. And again, there is the offsetting impact of more membership or fewer members. So, it modulates and it's all manageable. But as I said, actuarial soundness has to reflect the cost of healthcare services for your members and you can't recoup budget deficits with Medicaid money.
David Windley: Right, understood. Last question here, you've alluded to even voluntary give backs in or that that's something that you would contemplate is, are those actions, and I guess I'm wondering how formalized are some of those actions in your plans, and have you taken those into account in the reconfirmed guidance that you're making today. I'm just wondering, if you do decide to make voluntary payments, how might we account for those or learn of those?
Joseph Zubretsky: It certainly was contemplated in the very cautious outlook we gave for the second half. I would state it this way. A state might decide that they will take the action to recoup the money that wasn't paid in benefits through these rate refunds. If they don't do that and we trigger a minimum MLR, then we have to pay it back by regulation. If neither of those two things exist or happen and we still think that we inappropriately or inadvertently, unexpectedly benefited by this curtailment of utilization, we would work with our state customer and work on a program of either additional value added benefits for members, directed payments to stressed or distressed providers or just give them the money back. We just don't think it's helpful for the Managed Care industry to sort of have a surplus margin related to curtailed utilization in a pandemic and we'll report that as we report our third and fourth quarters, we will report to the extent we trigger minimum MLRs, we have retroactive rate refunds where we voluntarily granted money back to our customer.
David Windley: Very clear. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Charles Rhyee of Cowen. Please go ahead.
Charles Rhyee: Yes, thanks for taking the questions. Joe, obviously it seems like a lot of this when you guys gave you our outlook last quarter, you gave yourself a lot of room for a lot of this uncertainty and then we're seeing some of that a little bit play out. And obviously, at the same time, you've been able to maintain your earnings outlook for the full year here. But within that, were you surprised at although with how some of these adjustments came or was this sort of what you are already in discussions with states, at that time that you kind of reported last quarter. So it was sort of within the range of what you're expecting? And then sort of just a followup on the last question here, obviously several other states here that you're saying that you really don't have mechanisms in place, are those discussions, are there discussions ongoing with them currently? So it's a question of whether they make a decision to do something on that or is this - or these are situations where sort of no discussions have started?
Joseph Zubretsky: Yes Charles, I mean we knew we are headed into a very uncertain and unclear environment. I mean it's a pandemic and it's healthcare and we saw the utilization suppression. We knew that whatever the numbers are, we knew that we were benefiting or at least our P&L temporarily is benefiting materially by suppressed utilization. So yes, we expected our state customers to contact the industry, to figure out a way to recoup some of those funds, which is entirely almost the embodiment of actuarial soundness. The rates were super adequate for the COVID declared emergency period and therefore the money should be given back. So, this environment was entirely contemplated. Now at the beginning of the quarter, did I know that healthcare costs will be down between $190 million and $240 million? No. But when utilization was down 20% to 40% in healthcare categories representing two thirds of our spend, you knew that there would be some large distortions related to COVID. So yes, we anticipated this environment as the quarter progressed, we certainly monitored it and this is the result we produced. And I'll say it, the reason we gave you those numbers, if we really did want to highlight, and I'll make this comment, that when you take all the distortions, significant distortions related to COVID out of our numbers, it's a very, very strong quarter with good metrics. I mean, if you take out the $1.10 to $1.65 estimate of what COVID, increased our earnings per share by, we produced at a minimum $3 per share for the quarter, maybe as high as $3.55 for the quarter and that 82% MCR that we printed for the quarter had 400 basis points of COVID benefit in it, so banks were on our 86% result that we've been consistently and routinely producing. So we try to be clear. We try to separate and isolate those COVID distortions as clear as we could. And yes, we knew we were going through an unclear environment which is one of the reasons why we again gave cautious guidance for the back half of the year. Tell us where the pandemic is going and we'll give you a clearer picture, but the range of outcomes for the second half of the year is so varied and so wide, holding our guidance and giving you some qualitative factors rather than quantitative factors, we thought was the most responsible approach.
Charles Rhyee: I know you are having discussions with states like Texas, Washington, Florida, are those - are those when you kind of mentioned them, are they ones that they're just kind of outstanding, but nothing has really started?
Joseph Zubretsky: Texas and Washington have asked all - have actually expressed their interest in increasing Medicaid spending during this period of time. We had some early on, I think it was even in the first quarter, Washington as you know was one of the first state to get hit with the pandemic, and a lot of the behavioral providers in Washington who were on fee-for-service, were really, really getting crushed. And so, the state asked us, asked the industry to make some directed payments to providers which we gladly did. So, we're having discussions, that's just an example, we're having discussions with all our states, but Washington and Texas, yet have expressed more interest in infusing more money into Medicaid than extracting it from Medicaid.
Charles Rhyee: That's helpful. And one last just to clarify, you said additional FMAP could offset further rate headwinds or are you assuming anything above the 6% FMAP in the guidance, either for this year or when you think about next year?
Joseph Zubretsky: No. As you know, there is all kinds of jousting that's going on between the - in Congress related to this. But no, we did not, whether it's 12%, whether it ends up being 12% or 14%, we did not include any of that outlook as potential upside to what might happen in rates. If it happens, it would be great. I think states will be relieved and I think it will take a lot of pressure off, but no, we did not assume, we did not assume that would happen.
Charles Rhyee: Great, thanks a lot.
Operator: The next question comes from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Joshua Raskin: Hi, thanks, good morning. I appreciate you taking the question. I apologize for coming back to this voluntary actions or this correcting imbalances, but I just want to understand this in the context of Molina overall. Right? So if you're trying to sort of keep things flat, let's call it on the medical cost side. Right? So, a lot of it gets tripped from a regulatory perspective, but you're going to kind of, it sounds like give back any upside on the medical cost side as a result of COVID, but the enterprise has other headwinds. Right? Higher G&A cost and investment income coming in lower, et cetera. So, I'm just trying to understand, there's a confirmation of guidance, it sounds like none of that upside is on the medical cost side, but you've got other costs. I'm just trying to understand sort of how you think about progressing through the year? Should we just think of, if there is any potential upside, again it gets absorbed and the guidance is the guidance or is there some variability? And is it crazy to think additional costs on the G&A side or lower investment income could actually be a headwind?
Joseph Zubretsky: Josh, you certainly captured the essence of the difficulty of providing a point estimate forecast in this environment. And, I want to make sure it's clear what we meant. If a refund is enacted, the state is therefore recouping what they considered to be the excess capitation rate through an enacted temporary rate refund. If it triggers a minimum MLR, then there is already an existing regulatory mechanism. And all we are saying is, if we still felt there was a financial imbalance, we feel that imbalance should be corrected. I'm not defining what an imbalance means, whether it's 100 basis points or 200 to 300, it's going to be state-by-state, situation-by-situation. I'm not going to go into exactly what we mean by that. But I do think, as a philosophy, our Company and I think Managed Care generally is taking the approach that we do not intend to benefit by the suppression or the curtailment of utilization due to a global pandemic. Yes, I mean we contemplated the headwind, Tom spoke to it. We contemplated the investment income headwind going into the back half of the year. We contemplated that we would be spending extra G&A as we gave you our cautious approaches. So, it's a no. I wouldn't say they're headwinds. They were already contemplated in our comfort level in re-establishing the guidance we previously gave.
Joshua Raskin: Okay. And I don't think anyone is going to argue with the strategic value of working with your partners in a period where you benefit, so I think that's an obvious one. Just one quick followup on the development or sort of the lack thereof and sort of how that compares to last year, were there any - typically you guys have seen conservative reporting over the last couple of years, the reserving, I'm sorry. And that's favorable development, sort of the lack thereof. This year, were there some countervailing forces? Was there something else in there? I heard Tom say same methodology, et cetera.
Joseph Zubretsky: Hey Tom, would you like to take Josh's question about development? Please.
Thomas Tran: Yes, thanks Joe. You're right, Josh. Our reserve methodology remained the same. We said that four to six months that the development is negligible on a PPD basis is slightly favorable, but it's not material. That's why we don't want to call it out.
Joshua Raskin: Okay. But any - historically you had been seeing more, was there - I guess, is it just getting better at the estimation process or curious why you wouldn't see the same level of development if the methodology is the same.
Thomas Tran: Yes, I would say that - I would say that within anything you do related to reserve, there's always judgment factor, there is range, and you can always argue you come pretty close to it. In prior years, we had a lot more development in that we tended to be a lot more cautious. We still are very conservative in our reserve methodology. So I wouldn't say there is anything inherently different. It's just the outcome is a little bit closer to our estimate.
Joshua Raskin: Perfect.
Operator: The next question comes from George Hill of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
George Hill: Good morning, guys and thanks for taking the question. You guys have clearly positioned the balance sheet and the kind of the debt covenants to be active in the M&A market and you guys are performing well. I guess what I'm interested in hearing about is the other side of the discussions, do you feel like the current environment is giving kind of the smaller plans more breathing room and more room to run and set themselves up for growth or do you feel like this is accelerating M&A discussions?
Joseph Zubretsky: Hi George, it's Joe. I think COVID has not, in our opinion, changed the attitude of how people think about Managed Care or Managed Medicaid. It's a tough business, it's hard, you have to have the infrastructure, you have to have the scale, you have to have deep skills and knowledge, a lot of esoteric knowledge. It's not, it shouldn't be hobby and it shouldn't be an adjunct. You need to be highly skilled in this. So, no, it hasn't caused us to think any differently about it. Although, I would say that a small Medicaid plan somewhere, might be enjoying some additional profitability. It certainly hasn't changed and the discussions we've had with many plans across the country, it certainly hasn't emboldened them to think differently about the long-term nature of this business. I mean - if it takes a pandemic to put you on the right course to profitability, then you're making the wrong call. So no, we still have a really, really bullish outlook on small discrete bolt-on and tuck-in acquisitions.
George Hill: That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Fidel of Stephens. Please go ahead.
Scott Fidel: Hi thanks, good morning. Joe, first question just interested. I know that obviously there is a lot of moving pieces here, but when thinking about the three segments and the guidance that you had previously given for after-tax margins across the segments, maybe even directionally, can you help us think about in the current guidance, how each of those business lines may have evolved, whether tax [ph] is a little bit lower and Medicaid's a little bit higher or just interested in your thoughts around the three segments in terms of after-tax margins in the 2020 guidance?
Joseph Zubretsky: Sure. Well, certainly Scott, this thing this wouldn't be the quarter with all of the distortions caused by COVID, this would be the quarter to reset your long-term expectations on margin attainability in any line of business. There's just way too many distorted impacts and you think you have those distorted impacts captured appropriately. And I think we do. But no, I think we still think that Medicaid is a 3% - 4% contributor. We've been routinely producing mid to high single digits in Medicaid – Medicare. And I would say the one where we still have a desire and a hope and a strategy to drive growth in the Marketplace business at mid-to-high single-digit margins as a growth engine for the business is still in our long-term strategy, but this wouldn't be the quarter to sort of reset your expectations, and I would just answer the question that way.
Scott Fidel: Yes, I understood. And then just a followup, I had a followup question, just on MCC, and how you had laid out when you announced the deal the thoughts on accretion and just interested, if you look at MCC and with Magellan's reporting for them, they've had a big first half. They've already exceeded their full year segment profit guidance just in the first half, but obviously there was a lot of benefit in the second quarter from COVID, just like other health plans. So just interested whether you think that initial first year target of the $0.50 to $0.75 of cash EPS accretion, in your view is that still the right way to think about it or do you think that just given general trajectory that Magellan has had in improving MCC recently, that you can end up capturing a bit more of that multi-year accretion in the first year?
Joseph Zubretsky: Well, we're always pretty cautious forecasters. So I would say that there is a fair bit of caution built in to the $0.50- $0.75 to begin with on a cash EPS basis. And yes, I mean I obviously can't comment on anything I know through the integration process, but I certainly can respond to your comment on what was reported publicly. And yes, the first half, it looked like the businesses we're doing very, very well and you hit the question, how much of its COVID related and how much of it is sustainable. But certainly, we're pleased with what we saw in the public report and it certainly gives you as much or even more confidence that the accretion numbers we put out there are attainable.
Scott Fidel: Okay, thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ricky Goldwasser: Yes, hi, good morning. A question on Magellan and Passport. Magellan is in the guidance, Passport is not, what's the rationale for that?
Joseph Zubretsky: The rationale is, we did not feel it appropriate. We want to be deferential to our regulator customer in the state of Kentucky. We're buying the Passport brand and the assets, but the membership actually needs to be assigned to us. If we get more than 140,000, we projected we get about 140,000 in an auto-assignment process, which I think is a reasonable estimate. But, we do not want to be presumptuous that we would get all or most of the 350,000 and we're trying to be differential to the regulatory approval process. And the Magellan acquisition still needs regulatory approval. Once it's approved and we take over the legal entities, we will have the membership lock, stock and barrel. That was the reason.
Ricky Goldwasser: Okay. And then just on the bolt-on acquisition, I understand you're bullish on the opportunities there. But just going back to one of the earlier comments, so a bolt-on acquisition, I think you referred to as sort of part of organic growth. So should we assume that they are included in the guidance?
Joseph Zubretsky: Well, it's an interesting question. I believe in a quasi organic way, if you want to point of term, that anything done with generated cash flow is as good as organic, particularly with the prices we're paying. When you can - when you can recover the purchase price of an acquisition in the first year of positive cash flow at a purchase price of what is likely to be somewhere around 12% of premium, that's as good as organic, even though it's technically an inorganic play in the case of Passport. So to me, if you're buying bolt-on tuck-in acquisitions particularly membership migrations where you're paying per member or for the members retained, even though you're outweighing a modest amount of capital, it's just good as organic.
Ricky Goldwasser: Got it and then lastly, when we think about the new Medicaid members that are on-boarding. How do you see stuff like that margin profile concurred to existing population?
Joseph Zubretsky: Since many of them are coming either through or staying on through the redetermination process, the way I would describe it is, those members are an average acuity of our existing population, not materially more acute, not materially less acute. Now when the unemployment surge happens, I think you might get a slightly different story, since people that need healthcare generally seek it. So you could have a slight acuity shift there, which is one of the reasons why when we gave our guidance with, A, we don't know how many members were getting and B, we don't know their level of acuity or the cost of service. So it's clearly just another factor of uncertainty for the back half of the year.
Ricky Goldwasser: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Sarah James of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Sarah James: Thank you. Can you walk us through how pricing actions would have impacted the Hicks [ph] margins ex-COVID and what long-term margins are, what your goals are for that product? And then the comment, I just wanted to clarify your comment on risk scores being off from what you expected. How much of that is really related to industry trends or challenges because of COVID in getting new members evaluated and scored versus the population that Molina holds having a difference in the health of the population? Thanks.
Joseph Zubretsky: Sure. I'm going to answer your last question first and ask you to repeat the first one, I'm not sure I understood it. But, we clearly think this is a case where the new bronze membership we took on, we did not either have or get quickly enough the risk scores that we needed to service that population. And there could be just a lag by when you get all your coding done, when you get all your interventions done, we'll catch it up. We have a very good operation when it comes to risk scoring, so was the churn in that bronze population that caused us to have risk scores that lag. It will catch up and it's not a long-term concern. I think I need for you to repeat the first part of your question, it was about medical - it was about Marketplace rates, but I didn't follow it.
Sarah James: Yes, so I just wanted to understand with the Marketplace margins, I mean in some of the change there was the pricing actions and some was related to COVID. So just trying to understand ex-COVID, how do you think margins would have ended up, given your pricing actions? And how do you think about your margin goals for that product, long-term?
Joseph Zubretsky: Okay. We haven't changed our margin outlook for the product and we still have a strategy of growing the profit pool. And as I've said many times, on a year-by-year basis, me and my management team will make the call on whether we ease up on margin to grow membership or whether we pull back, ease up on membership to grow margin and we'll make that decision, geography by geography with a thorough analysis of the competitive landscape. With respect to the performance of the business, the COVID pandemic utilization curtailment did not have as significant impact on Marketplace as it did on other businesses. Initially, utilization was down in late March and early April, but it bounced back very, very quickly through May and June. So, it did not have as steep an impact on Marketplace as it did on Medicare and Medicaid.
Sarah James: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is a followup from Stephen Tanal of SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.
Stephen Tanal: Hey guys, thanks for taking this and sorry to come back on. I guess, I just in part wanted to clarify a point I made that I think is now wrong. I hadn't factored in Puerto Rico when I looked at organic growth, and so I just wanted to walk through the math of the bridge to '21 revenue. So if you have $17.8 billion of premium revenue in '20 and $21.5 billion in '21, obviously there is a $3.7 billion increase. Magellan Complete Care good for $2.8 billion. YourCare steps up $100 million and then you've divested Puerto Rico, which is $400 million. So I'd call all of those non-organic and so M&A seems to be contributing about $2.5 billion which implies about $1.2 billion net organic, which I think is organic growth of about 6.6%, which still, is a little bit conservative. But I just wanted to say is that math right and is that kind of how you guys are thinking about it or is there anything else you'd want to steer us there?
Joseph Zubretsky: You have the right model in your thinking. That is the model we've used, and again it's an outlook. It's not a pinpoint estimate. We believe, not believe, we couched it as conservative. We wanted to give you and our investors a very clear indication of where the trajectory of our top line is going. We will refine this estimate as we go forward, when we go through the third and fourth quarters. Who knows where our Medicaid membership will be, we could have another 150,000 members by the end of next quarter. We just don't know. So we will refine the organic aspects of this, but the inorganic aspects are pretty clear. And you're right, you have to factor in the $400 million Puerto Rico exit as an offset to some modestly calibrated organic growth.
Stephen Tanal: Yes, I missed that. And I guess just lastly, when might we learn about Kentucky and whether they're going to let you keep Passport's enrollment?
Joseph Zubretsky: Well there is - I don't want to comment on the regulatory process, but we're working through the regulatory process on the contract novation and on the after the process of getting approval to buy the Passport infrastructure. Open enrollment starts, I think it's mid-October. So we're hoping to have this whole thing included either by the end of the summer or early in September, but I can't predict when that will actually happen. But we're working hard on it and the earlier it can get done, the more stable that membership will be. Those members love the Passport brand. They like being in that plan. The state understands that. So I think we're all aligned in our intention to want to keep those members in the Passport brand, in the Passport care plan and in the Passport network.
Stephen Tanal: Great, thank you, again, I appreciate it.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference has now also concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-01 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Molina Healthcare First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Trudell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Julie Trudell: Good morning and thank you for joining Molina Healthcare's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. With me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Tom Tran. Press releases announcing our first quarter earnings and the definitive agreement to acquire Magellan Complete Care were distributed yesterday after the market closed. Press releases and the slide presentation regarding the MCC announcement are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay of this call will be available shortly after the conclusion of the call for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in our earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made herein are as of today Friday, May 1, 2020, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our first quarter 2020 press release. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements relating to our growth prospects, our 2020 guidance, a Magellan Complete Care acquisition and our long-term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report for the 2019 year filed with the SEC as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open up the call and take your questions. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?
Joe Zubretsky: Thank you, Julie, and good morning. This is an unprecedented time. The COVID-19 pandemic has had and will continue to have a profound impact on our country, our state partners, our members and our employees. Our team has worked tirelessly over the past two months to ensure that the needs of all of our constituencies are addressed quickly in this rapidly changing and challenging environment. COVID-19 impact on the U.S. healthcare system and the overall economy will continue to develop during the year, no doubt causing some short-term challenges, but also serving to highlight the important role government-sponsored healthcare plays in this type of crisis. Clearly, the macroeconomic environment will significantly impact our results this year and for the foreseeable future. With that said, as a pure-play government managed care business, we remained well positioned at a time when reliable access to high-quality healthcare is more critical than ever to our members and our state partners. We would like to provide you with updates today on a number of fronts. First, we will cover the financial results for the first quarter. Second, we will discuss the new but hopefully temporary operating environment created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Third, we will convey our guidance in the context of our first quarter results and this new operating environment; and fourth and lastly, we will provide some detail about our exciting acquisition of Magellan Complete Care that we announced last evening and other updates to our pivot to growth initiatives. Let me start with specific first quarter highlights. We reported earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of $2.92, with net income of $178 million and an after-tax margin of 3.9%, which slightly exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Premium revenue was $4.3 billion, an 8.9% increase over the prior year, which is consistent with our pivot to growth. The medical care ratio was 86.3%. We experienced medical cost pressure in the Medicaid line of business early in the quarter, resulting from slightly higher-than-normal seasonal flu, combined with early, but at the time, unidentified COVID-19 costs. These increased costs were offset by lower medical costs in all lines of business very late in the quarter as elective and discretionary healthcare services began to be postponed and deferred. These offsetting factors, combined with negligible prior period reserve development, produced a medical care ratio that squarely met our expectations. We managed to a G&A ratio of 7%, in line with our expectations, even after reflecting incremental expenses associated with the mobilization of our workforce to work at home, and other new operational protocols related to COVID-19. The total company after-tax margin was 3.9%, in line with our expectations, comprising product line margins, of 3.2% in Medicaid, 8.4% in Medicare and 4.1% in Marketplace. While a $2.92 earnings per share result modestly exceeded our expectations, its achievement is noteworthy in the context of the environment in which it was produced, which brings us to our second topic. The dramatically different environment in which we currently operate and some of the changes we have made in response, to recap a few of these measures. As shelter in place directives and all-out shutdowns quickly spread throughout our geographic footprint, we swiftly moved substantially all of our associates to work at home. We accomplished this with no disruption to service, as service metrics have remained excellent. This is a remarkable accomplishment in light of the potential for disruption to utilization management, care management, network access and information technology infrastructure. Substantially, all of our company's workforce, 10,000 associates are currently working from home. Many providers have seen disruption to their patient and revenue flows. Providers are struggling more than ever with utilization management, payment integrity routines and associated protocols in a rapidly evolving environment, which their cash flows have suddenly declined. While this requires adaptability on our end, we maintained strong performance in network management and utilization control. To assist providers in this challenging time, we accelerated claim payments by $150 million in late March and early April, while also extending the term of all non-COVID-19-related prior authorizations through September 1, 2020. We also increased Telehealth visit reimbursement to be at parity with in person visits and have expedited credentialing to ensure we have ample provider capacity. We understand that COVID-19 creates a variety of challenges for our employees, including family members at home who may need support, children who require care. We quickly implemented broad-based programs to help them during this time, including two special stipends of $500 or a total of $1,000, and each of more than 9,000 of our employees. We also implemented pay enhancements for essential employees required to come to the workplace and an additional COVID-19 pay lead policy. We are responding to dozens, if not hundreds, of special requests by our state customers, CMS and other governmental agencies. For example, we eliminated all member costs for COVID-19 testing and related treatments. We relaxed utilization management protocols in specific instances. We expanded Telemedicine access to all members and we made substantial contributions to the supply of personal protection equipment. We also committed support and resources for various nonprofit organizations serving those in need across the country. Support, supplies and monetary donations have been made to a variety of trusted organizations that directly serve vulnerable populations. In summary, we would characterize our first quarter results as more than respectable, in the context of unprecedented disruption to the entire spectrum of traditional managed care operations that occurred over the span of just a few weeks. In this difficult operating environment, it should be noted that our financial position is strong as we had already done the hard work to develop very solid capital and liquidity positions. A few words about these matters. Our share repurchase program is now completed as we purchased a total of 3.4 million shares in the quarter for approximately $450 million at attractive prices. We drew down $380 million and remaining capacity of our term loan facility to bolster our liquidity. We availed ourselves of this inexpensive debt instrument, which would have otherwise expired in the coming quarter. And after the completion of the share repurchase program and the term loan facility draw, we are holding approximately $840 million in excess parent company cash. I'll turn now to our third topic, a discussion of our near-term outlook, starting with a description of the current dynamics of our industry. The business model, government managed care, particularly Medicaid, has been stress tested through extreme economic scenarios, including the financial crisis, the subsequent boom and now the effects of the world's worst pandemic in over 100 years. The model has proven to work in both robust economies and in deep recessions. In strong economic environments with low unemployment, there are relatively fewer Medicaid and subsidized Marketplace members, capitation rates tend to be on the strong side of actuarial soundness as state budgets are well funded. During challenging economic environments with high unemployment, there are relatively more Medicaid and subsidized Marketplace members, capitation rates tend to be on the lighter side of actuarial soundness as state's budgets become tighter. So while government managed care, particularly Medicaid, is certainly impacted by this environment, the business and financial model flexes to accommodate these unusual and sometimes extreme circumstances. In an extreme environment, like the one we are in today, government intervention is often required to provide rescue packages, backstop the healthcare system and the disadvantaged population. The current crisis is no exception, as Congress and The White House have stepped forward with a number of measures. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act includes additional assistance for state Medicaid programs in the form of an increase to the FMAP match. Each state has received a 6.2% increase, which will extend throughout the COVID-19 public health emergency declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. There have also been a number of legislative aid packages enacted, including the $2 trillion stimulus package and the additional $484 billion supplemental COVID-19 spending package referred to as Phase 3.5. These funds in various forms, have been made available to providers, small businesses, individuals and a number of other constituents which should ease the pressure on the healthcare system during this crisis, which indirectly should help the viability of Medicaid programs. In short, we have a stress-tested business model and significant government intervention designed to accelerate the economic recovery. But even in the presence of these very positive factors, which support a favorable outlook for the longer-term trajectory of the business, the near-term quarter-to-quarter outlook remains difficult to predict. This brings us to a discussion of our guidance for the remainder of 2020. Two overarching factors must be considered in providing guidance in this environment. First, we face a remarkably wide range of possible medical cost scenarios that could emerge over the next nine months. We have modeled many utilization scenarios for the balance of the year, all of which are plausible, but each of which produces dramatically different results. Second, we must consider the likelihood of a significant increase in membership as a direct result of widespread unemployment. With rising unemployment levels and the suspension of Medicaid eligibility redetermination in many states, we are now likely to experience a significant increase in combined Medicaid and Marketplace enrollment. But by how much? We do not yet know. These COVID-19 effects on medical cost and membership are widely expected to have a net positive effect on near-term earnings. However, we are not yet prepared to draw this conclusion based on the many variables and uncertainties that remain as managed care moves through the full course of the pandemic. We are, however, prepared to state that we view our original 2020 plan in our previously announced guidance with enhanced confidence. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our full year earnings per diluted share guidance range of $11.20 to $11.70. Let me briefly walk through the thought process that supports our guidance. With respect to medical costs, at this point, we cannot predict with any degree of precision how the COVID-19 situation will impact medical costs in 2020 for a variety of reasons. First, the level of future-direct COVID-19-related costs is not yet estimable, as the incidence rate of diagnosis and hospital admission and the related cost per episode remain unclear. We observed a steep decline in elective medical procedures very late in the first quarter, through the month of April, but we do not know how long this phenomenon will persist and begin to normalize. The prevailing expectation is that discretionary utilization could be very low for the second quarter and perhaps beyond, but then rebound quickly in the second half as COVID-19 abates, and health system capacity frees up. And any potential short-term and nonrecurring benefit from lower utilization is partially limited by rebates we could be obligated to pay under applicable minimum MLR regulations. With respect to our administrative costs, our operating efficiencies are secure, and our operating leverage discipline is intact. There will continue to be G&A pressure, however, related to nonstandard operating protocols and the cost structure required to service any significant additional membership. Investment income will certainly be lower than our original forecast as money market and other maturing fixed income investments grow over into much lower-yielding instruments. We call two, that our portfolio is short dated, so the impact is rather immediate. Before the onset of COVID-19, we fully expected to achieve our membership guidance. With the unfolding unemployment levels and suspension of Medicaid eligibility redetermination, we are now likely to exceed that guidance. But by how much? We do not yet know. We have developed various models and scenarios based on macro and microeconomic factors, which produce widely different results. The eventual outcome will be influenced by several key factors, including unemployment levels, particularly in the lower wage services economy, availability of spousal coverage and COBRA uptake. The impact of these factors is likely to be greater in the economically sensitive Medicaid expansion sector. Relatedly, pre-COVID, we fully expected to achieve our premium revenue forecast for the year of $17.4 billion. Our previous membership forecast was achievable, and our rates were generally known. Now it seems likely we could exceed our revenue forecast, depending on the timing and extent of the additional membership we just discussed. The YourCare acquisition will be an additional source of growth when closed. I also note again that any potential upside to annual earnings if limited by rebates, we would be obligated to pay under applicable minimum MLR regulations. In addition to our compliance with such regulations, even if our MCRs come in lower than our own internal targets, with a mindfulness of our civic responsibilities, in order to address any unexpected imbalances, we could choose to reinvest some of that margin and provider based quality of care initiatives and additional benefits for our members, here in the communities where they live. While the current near-term economic environment is unpredictable, government managed care business has consistently shown very attractive growth characteristics with compelling free cash flow generation. We are in the right business at the right time to serve our members, support our state partners and move with confidence and conviction into the future. However, we also believe that making accurate and perhaps bold statements about our longer-term future makes little sense at this time. Accordingly, we have decided to postpone our May 28 Investor Day and perhaps later in the year. For now, we are strictly heads down doing the hard work we need to be doing. I turn now to the fourth and final area of commentary this morning, an update on the many activities relating to our pivot-to-growth strategy. Even with the extraordinary level of activity related to COVID-19, which is now our highest priority, we have not lost sight of our near-term focus on top line growth. Opportunities to enhance and expand our portfolio in a substantial and synergistic way occur infrequently. Last night, we announced just such an achievement as we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Magellan Complete Care, or MCC, from Magellan Health. This transaction caps nearly a year-long effort, long predating the COVID-19 crisis and delivers compelling benefits that will endure for years to come. A single bolt-on acquisition, we add businesses in three new states and three over lapsed states to our portfolio at a purchase price equal to approximately 30% of the target's revenue. Pro forma, newly expanded Molina Healthcare which surpassed the $20 billion mark in annual revenue. Let me briefly describe the businesses we purchased, their strategic fit with our portfolio and the resulting financial metrics. As of December 31, 2019, MCC served approximately, 155,000 members across six states, Virginia, Arizona, Massachusetts, New York, Florida and Wisconsin. Full year 2019 revenue was greater than $2.7 billion, and we project it to grow to $3 billion within two years. Magellan Complete Care comprises the following businesses: Full-service Medicaid in Virginia, a new state, full-service Medicaid in Arizona, also a new state, dual eligibles and Massachusetts branded senior whole health, again, a new state, managed long-term care and New York Metro area, branded senior whole health, a new geography, and two small businesses, one in Florida and one in Wisconsin. The addition of the MCC properties allows us to apply our previously demonstrated operating excellence to bring these businesses to our target margins, harvest the full benefit of fixed cost leverage by adding more revenue with little additional fixed costs and launch Medicare and Marketplace in new Medicaid geographies. Turning to the financial metrics. The $820 million transaction, net of certain tax benefits, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021. The purchase is funded entirely with cash on hand. We projected it will deliver returns well in excess of our cost of capital as our demonstrated operating capabilities puts us in a unique position to improve the margins of these businesses. As we move margins to our targets, deploy our enterprisewide platforms have the benefit of fixed cost leverage, we expect the acquisition to be accretive by approximately $0.50 to $0.75, cash earnings per diluted share in the first year of ownership and accreted by at least $1.75 in cash earnings per diluted share in the second year of ownership. These new additions to our portfolio demonstrate how carefully target M&A can accelerate our pivot to growth. With the addition of MCC, we will serve more than 3.6 million members in government-sponsored healthcare programs in 18 states. We will achieve enhanced geographic diversity, greater portfolio of depth, a meaningful addition of durable top line revenue. We will also be able to maintain continuity of care for MCC's members and stability for its state partners. These qualitative considerations have an added importance in the current environment and demonstrate our unwavering commitment to capably assist our government partners and bringing high-quality healthcare to individuals and families during this time of great need and into the future. Let me provide you with some additional highlights as it relates to our pivot-to-growth strategy. First, we terminated our agreement to purchase next level health due to the seller's stated unwillingness to close pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement. Second, in New Mexico, all legislative and political hurdles have been passed in connection with development of the first ever Indian managed care entity. We have been named as the exclusive manager of the managed care entity with the Navajo Nation. We stand poised and ready to serve the 75,000 Navajos eligible for Medicaid. Third, as previously announced, Texas canceled all of the new contracts associated with the STAR+ reprocurement awards, canceled the STAR chip RFP. The state has commented that it is not likely to reprocure this contract in the near term. And thus, we expect that our revenue base on this contract is secure at least through 2021. Fourth, we await the decision by the state of Kentucky on its Medicaid RFP, which we expect to be issued before the end of the second quarter. While Tennessee is the only state to specifically announce that it is postponing its RFP due to COVID-19, we believe there will be a general tendency by other states to also delay procurements until the COVID-19 crisis has abated. And finally, in our continued efforts to shape our business portfolio to optimize value, we have decided to sell our Puerto Rico Medicaid business. In doing so, we will work closely with the regulatory authorities and the provider community to ensure that our members in Puerto Rico are not disrupted and have reliable continuity of care. Now some concluding remarks. I hope it is clear to all that during this time, our members and customers are going to make requests of us to do the extraordinary. Our philosophy is to provide the health first and ask questions later. We trust that we will be adequately rewarded for the work we do and the services we provide. Although in this environment, we expect some nontraditional protocols to be invoked. This philosophy is not incongruent with shareholder friendliness at all. In fact, it is the epitome of a prudent environmental, social and governance philosophy, and the pillar of long-term business sustainability. We will fulfill our moral, civic and patriated duty, and we will emerge from this an even stronger company. Not only are we proving to be flexible and adaptable in this changing environment, but we will make sure our performance during this challenge, enhances our growing reputation among our existing customers and potential new customers alike, as a go-to resource in government-sponsored managed care. Before I turn the call over to Tom, I want to recognize our management team and the entire Molina community. During this unprecedented time, our team, 10,000 strong, has worked tirelessly to ensure that the needs of all of our constituencies continue to be addressed quickly and effectively. The true highlight of the quarter was the performance of our entire workforce and their rapid operational and clinical response across every dimension of the healthcare ecosystem, truly inspirational. They never lost sight of the members and the state partners who are counting on us to deliver whatever the challenge. Now I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for more detail on the financials. Tom?
Tom Tran: Thank you, Joe. This morning, I am going to provide some details on our first quarter results, provide additional insight into COVID-19's impact on our medical costs, and then I will provide more color on our 2020 guidance. So let me start with the quarter. Premium revenue for the first quarter of 2020 increased 8.9% to $4.3 billion compared to the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to rate increase in our Medicaid and Medicare lines of business. The consolidated MCR for the first quarter of 2020 increased to 86.3% compared to 85.3% for the first quarter of 2019. While prior year's reserve development in the first quarter of 2020 was negligible, the MCR in the first quarter of 2019 was positively impacted by approximately 140 basis points of favorable reserve development. The increase in the MCR in the first quarter of 2020 also reflects the increase in marketplace MCR. Now for some details on our results by line of business. In the Medicaid business, the MCR in the quarter was 88.9% compared to 88.5% in the first quarter of 2019. Our Medicaid performance for the first quarter of 2020 was solid. As we continue to manage medical costs, harvest the benefits of our payment integrity and utilization management protocols and attained risk score commensurate with the profiles of our members. In addition, the MCR in the prior year quarter was positively impact by the aforementioned favorable reserve development. The impact of COVID-19 on medical costs in the first quarter of 2020 was not significant. We experienced medical cost pressure in the Medicaid line of business early in the quarter, resulting from slightly higher-than-normal seasonal flu combined with early but lastly undetected COVID-19 costs, diagnosed as severe respiratory illness and pneumonia. We also experienced increased pharmacy costs in the quarters as members refuel the chronic medications in advance of the height of the crisis. This increased costs were offset by lower medical care costs in all lines of business very late in the quarter, as elective and discretionary healthcare services began to be postponed and deferred. In the Medicare business, the MCR for the first quarter of 2020 was 81.7% compared to 84.7%, in the first quarter of 2019, due to rate increase and higher quality incentive revenues. Finally, in the Marketplace business, the MCR for the first quarter of 2020 was 72.3% compared to 52.2% for the first quarter of 2019, which was mainly attributable to our lowering price in 2020 in an effort to be more competitive. The G&A ratio for the first quarter of 2020 improved to 7% compared to 7.3% in the first quarter of 2019, primarily related to increased revenues and positive operating leverage. The G&A for the quarter reflects approximately $6 million of incremental expense associated with the mobilization of our employees to work at home, along with other operational protocols associated with COVID-19. Now on to COVID. Let me offer some additional insights, but recognize that this picture is unfolding in real time. Some statistics, as we sit here today. Through April 27, we had a total of 950 members hospitalized with COVID-19, based on early data, the average length of stay is approximately 10 days, and there is no statistically credible cost per episode yet. In terms of geography, the health lands most impacted by COVID-19 are Washington, California and Michigan. While Washington was the first state impacted, Michigan has experienced the highest number of cases. While many of our states are estimated to have peaked, some have not. In proportion to our membership by line of business, Medicare has the highest percentage of incidents, followed by Medicaid and then Marketplace. Lastly, we experienced a steep decline in elective medical procedures beginning very late in March, which has continued through the month of April. Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, and our reserve position remains strong. Days in claim payable represents 49 days of medical cost expense compared to 50 days in the fourth quarter of 2019. Operating cash flow for the first quarter of 2020 was $136 million, with the change from the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to the timing of government payments and accelerated payments to providers. As of March 31, 2020, our health plans had total statutory capital and surplus of approximately $2 billion, which equates to approximately 347% of risk-based capital. Turning now to our 2020 guidance. We have reaffirmed our full year 2020 earnings guidance range of $11.20 to $11.70 per diluted share. First, let me walk through what is included in our full year guidance. Net investment income will experience headwinds in due to lower yields. We factor this in our guidance, and we expect it to be approximately $0.27 per share of headwind for the full year. Incremental G&A expenses related to COVID-19 for the balance of 2020 have also been considered. Now let me walk through what is excluded from our full year guidance. We recognize that rising unemployment levels are likely to result in an increase in Medicaid and Marketplace enrollment. However, we do not know the magnitude or timing and therefore, membership increase related to COVID-19 are excluded from our full year 2020 guidance. Due to uncertainty of COVID-19's impact on utilization and medical costs, its impact on net medical costs is excluded from full year 2020 guidance. I will also note that our full year 2020 guidance does not include the impact from previously announced acquisitions that have not yet closed. While the timing, duration and severity of COVID-19's impact on our financial metrics and earnings on an intra-quarter basis and throughout the rest of the year is not entirely predictable, we believe this is the most reasonable approach to providing guidance for the full year of 2020. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Justin Lake: Thanks, good morning, Joe, can you talk a little bit about the Magellan acquisition in terms of where you see margins along the trajectory of the of the accretion analysis? So where do you expect margins to be at the end of year one and year two to get to that accretion number?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, Justin. Let me I'll make sure I frame the deal first. This is right out of our playbook. And the way we think about this is this is sort of six bolt-on and tuck-in acquisitions all bundled into one. And as you know, what we've said many times, is we look for acquisitions that have stable membership, stable revenue flows and if they're underperforming, we certainly will bring to bear our operational excellence discipline and rigor in order to improve margins. So the way we look at this is you've seen the numbers. They are slightly profitable in the aggregate, approximately a 1% EBITDA margin. As you know, we've averaged about 6% or 6.5% EBITDA margins in the last couple of years. And if you can then pack on positive operating leverage, because we're not going to increase the fixed cost base of running our enterprise when we take these on, you can easily see how we got to the $0.50 to $0.75 of accretion in the first full year of ownership and at least $1.75 of cash earnings per share accretion in the second full year of ownership. So in the first year of ownership, we will most likely operate on their cost structure as integration activities take place. In year two, we will be migrating to the Molina cost structure, both our G&A platforms and the impact of payment integrity, utilization, management and risk or quality will begin to improve the medical cost ratios. And sometime in year three, we should reach the margins that we enjoy today in the moving of portfolio. Does that help?
Justin Lake: Yes. That's really helpful, Joe. And then if I could just ask one more on cash. You talked about, I think, $840 million coming out of the quarter. Can you walk us through the moving parts for the rest of the year in terms of dividends from the subs, etc? And where you expect to end the year from a cash perspective as well as a leverage perspective?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, Justin. Well, yes, we ended the quarter with $840 million of free and clear cash at the parent company. If we achieve our earnings guidance for the year, we can project we project to extract approximately $500 million of ordinary dividends from our operating subs. That could be higher if we're able to get extraordinary dividends. Bear in mind, we have a $500 million untapped revolver. And in connection with this transaction, we topped up that revolver with a short-term facility of an additional $400 million. So to recap, $840 million of cash, our projection of extracting at least $500 million of ordinary dividends during the balance of 2020 and then two untapped facilities which aggregate to $900 million of debt capacity. I'll also remind the group that our high-yield debt is trading really well right now. And that we believe we have really good access to the high-yield market if we wanted to make any of this financing permanent. So that's the cash flow story.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Fidel of Stephens. Please go ahead.
Scott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question, just wanted to ask on MCC and clearly, significant margin improvement opportunity. I think that is embedded in that deal for you. Interested what you're thinking in terms of what you can do to also accelerate top line growth from the MCC assets as well. And specifically, maybe thinking about the three new states, that you'll be entering. How could this potentially sort of tap into additional business-line opportunities for you and then in some of the other tap-on products that you'll be adding from this?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, Scott. There actually is an embedded growth rate in the acquired portfolio itself. The Arizona full-service Medicaid contract is at its very early stages. If I remember correctly, about 13,000 members at the end of the year with approximately $80 million in revenue. That's projected to achieve a membership of 75,000 to 80,000 over the next year. Because it enjoys a preferred position in the auto assignment algorithm in the state. So there's an inherent growth rate due to the Arizona property. And the point the second point you make is spot on. As you know, our strategy is to take our full product line and penetrate it into our Medicaid footprint. And now that we have a new Medicaid footprint in Arizona and in Virginia, we absolutely plan to launch a DSNP product in our Marketplace product in those geographies. And then, of course, just being in the boroughs in Westchester in New York city, gives you plenty of opportunities to look for bolt-on other bolt-on opportunities in the city and to perhaps grow the business. As you know, right now, we're in upstate New York. And don't have a produce in downstate New York. But this gives us plenty of opportunity to think more broadly about how to participate in Metro New York.
Scott Fidel: Got it. And then just my follow-up question. I understand that you're just hesitant right now to build in anything on revs or enrollment from rising unemployment. Just interested if you can maybe just give us a little insight into maybe just what you've seen so far in April. Possibly in the Medicaid and the Marketplace exchange lines, especially given states relaxing redetermination reviews?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure. I'm going to break with tradition air a little bit. You tend not to talk about what's going on in the current quarter, but this is an unusual time. And the points you mentioned are really, really important to pretend what could happen to membership. First thing I would point to is before talking about April, for the first time in many, many quarters, maybe even since I got here, we actually had membership growth in Medicaid sequentially March 31 over the end of the year. Good growth in Washington, Michigan, held steady, good growth in Illinois, offset by some losses in Puerto Rico. So our efforts to work with providers to keep more members in the system and to bring on more members are pushed to make sure that in the redetermination and re-eligibility process that we hold on to more members is starting to work. Pushing that forward now to the direct question you asked, it's even looking better in April. Our Medicaid membership is likely to be up over 30,000 members just in the month of April. And the interesting point I will make is we believe we're pretty sure that none of that membership arrived as a result of accelerated in the surge in unemployment. It's too soon to see people that became unemployed in March, end up in managed Medicaid. So we believe that the 30,000 growth in April is truly due to the suspension of eligibility of determination in the states. And without that churn, you're just not going to lose the members. They stay longer, they stick longer. And as you know, many states actually have suspended redetermination, and some have even announced perhaps even for a full year. So that really sort of pretends well for the membership growth before the surge due to unemployment actually arrived, which is likely to in May and beyond. Does that help?
Operator: The next question today comes from Kevin Fishbeck of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Kevin Fishbeck: Thanks. I was just wondering what you think the MLR might be on these new members coming into the Medicaid and to the exchange programs. I guess last recession, we did see some heads up demand initially on the new medicated lives. And just thinking about whether you expect that to happen. And on the Medicaid side, if these patients are members or people who would have been on COBRA, you expect any adverse MLR there?
Joe Zubretsky: Yes, we have various views on it. I mean I think basically, and I think it's generally you say that if somebody needs insurance, they buy it. And if they don't, they won't. So there's just sort of an inherent bias, adverse selection bias in the whole process. We actually have various scenarios, some of which might say that there's higher acuity coming in through membership and some say that it will be on par with what we have. It's hard to say and where the number is coming from. Are they coming from a very rich self-insured plan and a big company? Or are they coming from a small group plan for a small business? So it's really hard to say right now, which is obviously one of the reasons why we're reluctant to predict what this surgeon membership brings. We'll see a surge on membership. We have to build the operational platforms and hire the people to service that membership and then as you suggested, the acuity of that membership is unknown. But I think the prevailing wisdom is, while it might be slightly better and worse than the average, that's not going to be a significant factor in taking on these members.
Kevin Fishbeck: All right. Great. And then when I look at your guidance, you're excluding a number of things from your guidance, but I see that pretty much all of them are the things that are most be positive than they are to be negative. Is there anything negative, really, I guess, that is not included in guidance or has the potential to be a significant negative?
Joe Zubretsky: If understand your question correctly. The two factors that we updated in our guidance are one that's sort of easy to understand and engage. And that is our portfolio is going to roll over into lower-yielding investments. It's irrefutable and already happening. And I think Tom pitched that as a $27 earnings per share $0.27 earnings per share headwind in our guidance. We also believe putting the accelerated membership aside that we will incur higher SG&A related to COVID operational protocols, financial assistance to our employees, etc, which also we factored into our the reaffirmation of our guidance, but we did not update for anything else.
Kevin Fishbeck: Yes, that's what I'm saying. I'm saying you reaffirmed guidance, we're including some negative thing. You're actually getting a lot of the members, executing the deals and these things all seem like they're actually going to be upside to the number. So though it seems like there's going to be some upside to the number. I just want to know if there's anything else that you're excluding that you think might be the opposite way of the counteract or it's really just conservatism?
Joe Zubretsky: No. It's basically just saying the production of core earnings just got a little better, but we did not factor in any of those COVID-19 impacts. But yes, with those headwinds, we're saying core earnings gets a little stronger.
Kevin Fishbeck: It's great, thanks.
Operator: The next question today comes from Gary Taylor of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Gary Taylor: Hi, good morning. I had two quick questions. The first one, I just want to go back to, Joe, your comments about Medicaid MLRs? I know there's also some states with pre-tax caps, but sort of the curves on how low MLR could effectively go and flow through earnings. So certainly, we understand that those exist. I guess the question is, on a state basis, are those all typically just calculate on the state fiscal or calendar year. There's no rolling period like there are in some of the federal minimum MLR requirements.
Joe Zubretsky: Yes, Gary, that's my understanding. And there's very few adjustments like in the Marketplace MLR where taxes and all these other factors create a dramatic difference between the regulatory minimum and what you publish in your financials. But yes, seven of our 14 states have some form of MLR floor, ranging from 85% to 86%, except Puerto Rico, which is 92%. Those also exist in the expansion population and exist in the ABD business, but usually at different rates. So yes, there are very few adjustments from what you publish, and the minimum. And by understanding is they work on a one year fiscal year basis, not a rolling basis.
Gary Taylor: And my second question is you talked about 950 members hospitalized with COVID-19, no statistically credible cost per case. So I guess two questions. One, are those are the provider revenue cycle claim submissions being materially delayed? And then secondly, I thought most of your contracts in Medicaid would pay on a DRG basis, are you saying you're just not seeing the DRG coding yet? Or is there enough complexity to sort of outlier payments on outlier length of stay cases that dedicating all that still doesn't give you a good sense of the numbers yet?
Joe Zubretsky: No, it's actually not that complicated. Again, 1,000 cases, so you can't draw any statistical credibility to that. We have five day stays, and we have one month stays. We have people in the ICU on ventilators and people that go in and go out. Cost range from $10,000 per episode to $100,000 per episode. But we're now capturing all the codes. And I think while Tom was suggesting in his prepared remarks was early in the quarter we are getting tagged with all types of respiratory elements, particularly in Washington and California. This was before COVID was a phenomenon. And we've hindsight and better information now, we have attributed that, and it has been attributed to COVID-19 actually showing up in Washington and California far before anybody actually thought it was. But no, there's no intrigue around how we're getting billed and coded for these things with only 1,000 data points, as I said, it's hard to draw any statistical conclusions. On your other point, we are not seeing any dramatic change in the administrative aspects of our provider dealings. We are seeing a drop in pre-authorizations, and claim submissions just because of the elected procedure deferrals. But there has not been a huge disruption in either the level of payments and the level of submissions that we've observed to date, that could change here over the next couple of months.
Gary Taylor: Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Matthew Borsch of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Matthew Borsch: Yes, sir. Thank you. I was hoping you might comment on how you're thinking about the changes in enrollment trajectory over time. I realize that probably a number of scenarios you're looking at for how this recession plays out. But for lack of a better metric, I mean, do you think comparing with sort of duration and gap for 2008, 2009, it's the broad side of the barn?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure. Well, Matt, all of you have seen all of the different pundits and think tanks project what this might look like with unemployment scenarios ranging from 10%, 20%, even up to 30% with Medicaid roles expanding anywhere from 10 million to 30 million members. A very wide range of results. I think as we said in our prepared remarks, there are lots of factors to consider here. Number one, COBRA used to be a rather significant factor in how many members would come in. But now with subsidized Marketplace, you could argue that there will be more members attracted to the subsidized Marketplace which might be the 102% of premium that COBRA charges. So there's all types of phenomenon. Even on the unemployment rate, we have to look at subsectors of the economy. We're looking at the lower wage service economy. And I believe that's not going to come back quickly. That sandwich shop, that drycleaner shop, that coffee shop, these small businesses are going to struggle to get back into business. And we think that the lower-wages service economy will remain have higher unemployment rates for a longer period of time than perhaps the higher-wage sector of the economy. So if you take our market share, if you do a projection of unemployment in all of our states, ranging from 10% to 20%, look at our market shares, in Washington, it's 50%. In most states, it ranges from 5% to 25%, 9% on average. You can actually craft a scenario where the membership peaks at a pretty significant number. As unemployment softens, some of that goes back. But I think there's a permanent delta here on that lower-end service economy that's going to struggle to get back into business quickly.
Matthew Borsch: Yes, that brings up a very closely related question, which is, again, we're shooting the dark here. But would you predict we might see some structural changes in how healthcare coverage is handled at the small group and particularly the lower end of the small group, maybe lower wage end of the spectrum, given it's been volatile for a while, and now it's even more volatile.
Joe Zubretsky: It's a good question. I say during the all the swirl and the activity around this, I hadn't given that much thought. But the way we look at it is we now do have a product suite that works all the way up to 400% of federal poverty level when you think about it. So when we have Medicaid expansion in a variety of states, up to 138 then we have a highly subsidized Marketplace up into the 200, 250 range. We have products that the population can buy all the way up to that level. And so it would seem that we have the product suite, both commercial and government-sponsored that we need to satisfy the population. I hadn't given your specific question, a lot of thought during all this, but I will do so and get back to you on that.
Matthew Borsch: Thank you.
Joe Zubretsky: You're welcome.
Operator: The next question comes from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Josh Raskin: You're asking. Your line is live. Perhaps, your line is muted. Sorry about that. Sorry I was on mute question around the exchanges. And I know it's early, but sort of April application processes and things that are coming in. I'm just trying to get a sense of as individuals move from the commercial markets into whether it's Medicaid or Marketplace. Sort of where do you think the magnitude of impact is going to be? And again, is there any data that you're seeing on Marketplace applications to date, that would be helpful.
Joe Zubretsky: Right. We are seeing, I'd say, at this early stage, given that April data I was speaking about, we haven't seen Marketplace growth yet. But we have seen a slowing in the natural attrition rate. As we said at the beginning of the year when we gave our Marketplace forecast, we have reduced our attrition rate outlook to 1%, 1.5% a month. Which would suggest 3,000 to 4,500 members, that is slowing. We believe membership will start growing again here very soon. The point I was making before, I think, is the important one. Is that COBRA charges 102% of the full premium? And we believe, based on all the models we've looked at, that a highly or even reasonably sized subsidy in the Marketplace products, silver product, let's say, beats 102% of commercial all the time. And so we're likely to see more uptake in the Marketplace than maybe in past recessions when the Marketplace actually didn't exist. So now that it does exist, I think it's going to be the net beneficiary of folks who come out of commercial plans. And find that highly subsidized Marketplace product beat staying on COBRA.
Josh Raskin: And Joe, just to follow-up on that point. Is it fair to assume that I know you talked about some of the adverse selection bias in processes like this where people buy insurance if they need it. But in this situation, isn't it fair to assume that COBRA, those remaining on COBRA are going to be ones that are more focused on continuity of care and have chronic needs and things like that? Are you assuming that the Marketplace membership may actually have a positive bias?
Joe Zubretsky: Well, I think that's an excellent point. Generally speaking, if you're in the middle of some kind of expensive treatment protocol or our chronic member on expensive drugs, you just don't move because you're happy with what you have. But as you know, COBRA has unlimited life, and those members have to go somewhere eventually. Right now, we're not assuming anything other than we're building the infrastructure to make sure we can handle the influx of members. Jason Dees, who runs our Marketplace business, is very mindful of how do we capture really risk scores and risk profile in these members. So we know when we get them, how to treat them, how to get them into care plans, etc. So very early stages. I don't have any more thought on it than what I just gave you.
Josh Raskin: And just one quick call on the revenue guidance, is there an assumption of pass-through revenues that are going to be coming through? Or is that in the bucket of COVID impact that we're not anticipating?
Joe Zubretsky: I'm not sure I understand are you referring to a Medicaid? And I'm not sure what you're referring to exactly, Josh.
Josh Raskin: Yes, Medicaid payments where you're going to see increases to the provider fee schedule they get passed through in terms of Medicaid.
Joe Zubretsky: I think it's possible. I will answer the question more broadly. Most of our state customers are very concerned with the viability of various aspects of the medical communities in their states. And whether it's going to be enhancements to the fee schedule request, as you've seen, to pay claims faster, in some cases, even advanced payments to small providers, they are very focused on the health of the provider system. But we have not seen yet, from what I've been exposed to, any major changes to fee schedules. But there are many conversations ongoing about how to keep the providers funded during this entire process.
Josh Raskin: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Sarah James of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Sarah James: Thank you. I wanted to circle back to your comments that in a strong economy, Medicaid rates are set at the high end of actuarial soundness and in the recession, will be set at the low side. Can you give us more detail what is that meaningful margins when you think about the peak to trough move?
Joe Zubretsky: I think the first thing I would say, Sarah, is we put a lot of faith in the concept of actuarial soundness, there's ebbs and flows. There's constant tension when benefits are carved in, when the benefits are carved out, when new populations are attempted to be capitated. There's a constant ebb and flow. And the only point we are making is if from a business model perspective, you would expect that in very strong economies when tax revenues are flowing, that rates would be on the strong side of actual soundness and the opposite could be true when tax revenues are down, in terms of recession. But the concept of actuarial soundness has proven in this industry. It's proven in the years that I've been here as testament to the margins that we're achieving. There are ebbs and flows. And all I'm suggesting is that in a recession, we could expect rates to be on the softer side of the actuarial soundness concept. But we still have not changed our outlook for our target margins, but a lot needs to be seen here in terms of what trend figures are going to be baked into the 2021 rates. Are we going to use normalized trends off of 2019? So when trend is inflecting the way it is, I think the bigger issue is when trend is inflecting up and down the way it is, how are the actuarial teams and our state customers and the actuarial teams of the managed care industry going to reconcile the various views of medical cost trend when we go to look at 2021 rates. But all that being said, I have a lot of faith and confidence in the actuarial soundness concept because it's actually worked well for managed Medicaid.
Sarah James: That's very helpful and comforting given how strong the relationship is with the state actuaries as medical trend does change. So just one more follow-up there. You mentioned that one of the possibilities could be items being carved in and carved out. Can you provide us any color on your discussions with states on how they're viewing the shape of their program, given where their budgets may be?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure. The one aspect of managed care and medical cost in managed care that comes to mind in your specific question is related to pharmacy. As you know, that is commonly discussed as to either be carved in or carved out. As you probably saw in the New York state budgetary process that was just finalized they have suggested that at some point in the future, New York State could carve out pharmacy. Obviously, not terribly material for us with a $200 million business there, but carving in and carving out is actually, in my view, more of a question of how much rate how much capitated rate do they put in or take out. We'd rather see it bundled into the full capitation and have more revenue. But if it's carved out, it's if they carve out on an unsubsidized basis, you lose your 2% margin on what's carved out and that's it. So you just you hope through the negotiating process that the proper amount of capitated rate is either carved in or carved out. That's the issue, in my opinion.
Operator: The next question comes from George Hill of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
George Hill: Yeah, good morning, guys and thanks for taking the questions a lot been covered. A lot has been covered. I guess, Joe, kind of a follow-up on the Magellan deals. As you think about the M&A environment, do you expect kind of the current environment that we're going into now to kind of make M&A more difficult or less difficult trying to figure out if people are targeting Medicaid enrollment to kind of defend smaller businesses and smaller plants, making them harder to acquire? Or could people see this as an opportunity to exit? And I have a quick follow-up for Tom.
Joe Zubretsky: Interesting question. I think most of the investment banking community would tell you that in the past couple of weeks or months, that many of in-flight processes have stalled. This one's been going on for some time. And so it was able to get done with great cooperation from the guys from Magellan, and the teams worked well together. It's hard to say. I think this business is a tough business. And we look at some of the smaller players, the not for profits, the single state players, it's hard to get the operating leverage, the scale, the clinical resources you need to actually do a good job. It's just a tough business. But when this is all you do, and you have 3.5 million members and $20 billion of revenue, we certainly have the investable base, the skills and resources to be well here. So buying underperforming properties at 30% of revenue, getting the EBITDA margins up to 6%, 6.5%, that is a great use of our resources and our skills. Particularly when they're funded with cash that's generated from core operations, and we don't have to go to the equity markets or even the debt markets to fund them. So here in the foreseeable future. Obviously, we're going to be working on the regulatory process with Magellan, then we'll be integrating it. But we're still going to look for these single area bolt-on, tuck-in opportunities like the YourCare acquisition, which is fabulous for us. We're going to continue to look for them because we actually have the cash flow to action on them if they're actionable.
George Hill: That's helpful. And I guess, Tom, my quick follow-up for you is an accounting one, which is I know it's early, but if we start to think about the contracts where you guys have MLR minimums. I imagine at some point you'll have to reserve against revenue or have contra revenue accounts for what could be premium rebates or premium holidays. Have you guys started to do that yet? And is it too early to think about or discuss what the magnitude of that could look like?
Tom Tran: Good question there. And we do that consistently every quarter. As you know, in our marketplace, we have to provide reserve for potential rebate based on certain forecasting of the eventual medical care ratio. And we do the same thing for our Medicare line of business. And we will be doing the same thing for Medicaid, should that happen to be the situation.
George Hill: Okay. But I guess, no way to kind of quantify what the incremental could look like from normal versus kind of what we're stepping into the next couple of quarters?
Tom Tran: No. No. As we said in our prepared remarks, the volatility of this impact on from COVID on the impact on medical costs is unknown. That's why we hesitate to provide more color on that. So we'll have to let this thing play out over the next couple of quarters. And it's typically done based on either a calendar year or contract year depending on how the state prescribed that.
Operator: The next question comes from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Dave Windley: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Joe, you always have a great ability to cut right to the chase. My question is around operating Medicaid managed care organization in a COVID environment, thinking about a couple of transactions you now have in-flight that include New York operations at the center of COVID. So just interested in kind of understanding how you might see the future change in one's ability, the risks and opportunities in managing a plan in a cohort effected environment given that you seem willing to step right into the epicenter with both of these acquisitions, YourCare and MCC having significant operations in New York.
Joe Zubretsky: Thanks for the question. It's look, it's a challenge. We moved 6,000 people from working in office to working at home. There are, as I said, hundreds of requests we're getting from regulators every day to do certain things. That requires you have to reconfigure your provider contracts. I mean the operating protocols and the amount of operational change that we're going through right now and dealing with all this is significant. But in New York, our business is in upstate New York, which is not the epicenter of COVID, but certainly is being impacted. The MLTSS business in New York is a good business. We managed $2 billion of LTSS benefits nationwide. I think we're the largest or the second largest manager of LTSS benefits. So it fits nicely with the portfolio. It's really it's not a medical business, per se. It's a business where we cater to the activities of daily living to pretty complex members under the Medicaid program. But it's a good business. It's got seven over $700 million in revenue. It's reasonably profitable. We think we can enhance the profitability by managing the hours more effectively. But COVID-19 was certainly a consideration as we actioned it. But we're either COVID-19 will either have abated by the time we own it or be so well understood and well managed, that it will be the new normal. So it was a consideration, but it did not deter us from wanting that property and including it in the purchase.
Dave Windley: Great. On exchange, you commented that you haven't really seen a material change in trajectory on membership there. Maybe that changes. Does that influence the what is likely to happen this year, influence the way that you will address your growth strategy in that business for 2021 after the 2020 kind of positioning didn't pan out as you thought it would?
Joe Zubretsky: It's a very good point. I will expect in the question, I will reiterate that our strategy hasn't changed. We had committed to growing the pool of profits of the exchange business. And had articulated that we will make the local geographic call as to where to push price for gaining membership and where it ease on or where to push price to gain members push price down to game membership, and we're ease up on it to gain margin and make local decisions based on competitive forces. And obviously, as you suggested, and admittedly, we got the elasticity of demand equation long last year. The bigger issue for us. So the strategy hasn't changed. We're going to take the full profits and attempt to grow it over time at reasonable margins. The rent that's been thrown into the works, obviously, is coded. Right now, as we sit here today, we're developing the pricing model for 2021. They're off of the 2019 baseline, which is pure of COVID. But the question will really be, what type of rates go into the market for 2021, given the COVID environment that we're in right now? So our belief is that in discussions with regulators, allowances will be made for maybe some later rate filings, maybe rate filings that include COVID and others that don't. Allow us to see more so that we can take a reasonable view of medical cost trend, getting into the rate so that we're not guessing, and the industry is not guessing. We don't want to push so much rate into the market that we have excess margins, and we certainly don't want to undercut it to where margins are too low. We want to get it right. So we're working with the regulators right now on the pricing regimen for 2021.
Dave Windley: Got it. One last one, if I could. What level of cash do you want to have liquidity, do you want to have to run the business? And are you willing to add more leverage in this environment?
Joe Zubretsky: Our leverage position is very strong, and I would encourage people not to look at our debt to total cap, which averages 40% to 45%, I think, it's 46% at the end of the quarter. Because that generally just sounds high to people. Our debt-to-EBITDA coverage is 1:1. Our leverage is 1:1. Our fixed interest cost coverage is like three weeks of earnings. We've covered our fixed charges and interest. So we're actually underlevered from a cash flow perspective. Having said that, in this environment, you always want to be more liquid than you otherwise would, but with $840 million of cash, $500 million of dividends expected this year, $900 million of untapped facilities, we believe we still have enough cash and enough liquidity cushion that have another bolt-on acquisition opportunity came up this month, next month or next quarter, we'd be able to action it. But in this environment, you want to be a little more liquid than normal. We usually target $100 million of parent company cash as a floor, and we'd probably think slightly higher than that in this environment
Operator: The next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley..
Unidentified Analyst: This is Alex [ph] actually in for Ricky. First question, I just have two. One is just following up on George's question about M&A. So you talked about how Magellan is kind of a year-long for to close so could you give some color just on the typical time line to get your deals ready to announce? And how many kind of companies that you're looking at, at any given time?
Joe Zubretsky: Well, without getting into the process because that's we don't really want to do that. But the point what we wanted to make was that this efforts or long predated coped when the process started. And that was the only point we're really making. But willing buyer, willing seller, it's hard. There's a lot of properties out there, and many of them aren't actionable. But getting something that strategically fits from a product and geography perspective, and then one that's actionable is hard work. We have an expert M&A group, led by Mark Keim and a great team of people who are scanning the universe for actionable opportunities that fit with the portfolio and that are actionable. And last year, we found YourCare, we found NextLevel, but we obviously terminated our agreement with the NextLevel for very good reasons. And then this opportunity came into the market, and we worked it really, really hard with great cooperation from the folks from Magellan. There are others in the pipeline. I can't mention what they are and where they are, but there are still properties out there that are actionable, and we still have the liquidity and the resources to action them if, in fact, they come to market and can be actioned.
Unidentified Analyst: That's helpful. And then just on the deferred elective care side. We've heard ranges over the last week, about 15% to 40% of total medical costs are associated with elective care. Is there anything that you can give us on how your elective costs compare to your book?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure. It's hard to draw any conclusions from two weeks in March, but we certainly could draw conclusions from the full month of April. On the outpatient and professional services side, outpatient and ambulatory surgeries, depending on the geography line of business, pre authorization requests and notifications down 30% to 50%. Diagnostic testing and imaging, another sort of elective category, 40% to 45% PCP referrals to specialists, DNA, all down significantly over comparable periods. We're a seeing it on the inpatient side, particularly with elective surgeries and even in behavioral services. So in the medical cost categories that tend to be elective and discretionary we're seeing pre authorization requests and notifications down significantly over comparable periods. The other point I would make here is how long does this persist? There are various mandates of the suspension of elective procedures. That can't be done under either state authority or governmental authority that will end soon at some point. But there will be a contagion of fear of patient fear of going into facilities for the risk of being infected. So how fast they rebound, how fast the boomerang effect and when they come back, is another factor and why predicting what medical costs look like here over the next three to six months is difficult. I remind everyone, when we're talking about the rebound factor is there's a capacity limitation on how fast things can rebound. There are only so many beds. There are only so many doctors, and there's only so many hours in a day. And when you have three, four, five or even six months of pent-up demand, it cannot race through the pipe that quickly. There's a capacity limitation on how fast it rebounds, which adds another variable into forecasting how quickly this could rebound. So I hope that helps, but that's sort of a view of what March and April looked like from an elective and discretionary procedure outlook.
Operator: The next question comes from Charles Rhyee of Cowen. Please go ahead.
Charles Rhyee: Yeah, thanks for taking quite not just to make just maybe two quick questions for me here. Joe, you talked about potential delays of decisions. But you still said you expected Kentucky sometime in the second quarter. So are you still expecting Kentucky to make a decision in the second quarter? Or do you think that is upward delay?
Joe Zubretsky: We've been told that actually, we were told month of May, but we wanted to just open it up in the second quarter because we just weren't sure. But we've actually originally, they actually posted that they were going to do it in April and then due to COVID-19, they actually then pushed it. And whether it's actually published in writing or they made an announcement, I can't recall. But they did say May, but we sort of opened it up and said sometime in the second quarter. So we haven't heard about a suspension. And until we hear otherwise, we still expect the second quarter announcement.
Charles Rhyee: Great. And then, Joe, at the beginning, you kind of also mentioned about some of the things you are doing for your members, including opening access for Telehealth. And we saw the announcement, obviously, several weeks back about using Teledoc. Can you just help us understand a little bit how Telehealth is priced for a Medicaid population when you extend it to your members? Is that should we think about it in the same way as for commercial population that the members are paying some dollar visit fee? Or is that something that you guys include in sort of the overall cost that you're charging to state?
Joe Zubretsky: The first thing I would say to that is in our company, our Telehealth solution is more fully implemented in our Marketplace product than it is in our Medicaid product. It is beginning to be rolled out in our Medicaid product. And obviously, this accelerated the rollout because it was the right thing to do and members couldn't get in person visits. As we said in our prepared remarks, we created a parity mechanism between in-person visits and Telehealth visits. But I wouldn't want to say how it's priced, but it's more penetrated as we're searching for in our Marketplace book, than our Medicaid book. And we have a contract, we pay for it, and it's loaded in the benefit, is really all I can say.
Charles Rhyee: I understand that. I mean I guess, is there a cost sharing then? Do members pay some amount to access it like they would in a commercial population? In a more typical commercial population? Or is it done differently? I guess...
Joe Zubretsky: Well, generally, in Medicaid, the members are not paying anything out of pocket for any service. So in Medicaid, the answer is no. And I believe I'll project this and get back to you. But in Marketplace, it's probably like any other claim payment. If somebody's decided they're deductible, it gets treated that way. If there's a co-pay whatever the benefit plan is, I think it gets treated just like another claim pursuant to the benefit structure of the contract.
Charles Rhyee: Okay, thanks, that's it. Really helpful.
Joe Zubretsky: Thank you.
Operator: As there are no further questions, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. The conference has now also concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-11 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Molina Healthcare Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Trudell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Julie Trudell: Good morning, and thank you for joining Molina Healthcare's fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Tom Tran. The press release announcing our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings was distributed yesterday after the market closed, and the release is now posted for viewing on our Investor Relations website. A replay of this call will be available shortly after the conclusion of this call through February 17. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who are listening to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks are made herein as of today, Tuesday, February 11, 2020, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most direct comparable GAAP measures can be found in our fourth quarter 2019 press release. During our call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including statements relating to our growth prospects, our 2020 guidance and our long-term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review our risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report for 2019 filed with the SEC as well as the risk factors listed in our other reports and filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call and take your questions. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?
Joseph Zubretsky: Thank you, Julie, and good morning. On the call today, I will provide highlights from the fourth quarter and full year 2019, discuss our growth initiatives, review our capital allocation priorities and provide our full year 2020 earnings guidance with detail on each of our three lines of business. Yesterday, we reported earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of $2.67, with net income of $168 million and an after-tax margin of 3.9%. I am pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results. For the full year, we met or exceeded our expectations. Premium revenue was $16.2 billion and in line with our expectations. The medical care ratio was 85.8%, as our cost containment efforts continued to control medical costs while ensuring the highest quality of care for our members. The G&A ratio was 7.7%, as we leveraged our fixed cost base while beginning to invest in growth. We improved our Medicaid and Medicare margins and earned exceptionally high margins in our Marketplace business. The 2019 total company after-tax margin of 4.4% was supported by 3.2% in Medicaid, 6.7% in Medicare and 10.3% in Marketplace. All in, this performance resulted in net income of $737 million and earnings per diluted share of $11.47. In a year when premium revenue decreased by 8% due to legacy contract losses, we were able to deliver 4.4% after-tax margins and earnings per share growth of 8%, a testament to our early-stage focus on margins. During the year, we improved an already-strong balance sheet and capital structure while the business continued to generate significant excess cash flow. In the fourth quarter, we harvested an additional $300 million of dividends from our operating subsidiaries, bringing the total for the year to $1.4 billion. As of December 2019, unrestricted cash at the parent company was $1 billion. In early December 2019, our Board authorized a share repurchase program of up to $500 million. Through February 7, under a 10b5-1 trading plan, we repurchased 1.9 million shares for $257 million. I will now comment on the progress we made in the second half of 2019 on our pivot to growth strategy. During the past few months, we announced two acquisitions: YourCare in Upstate New York and NextLevel Health in Illinois. These acquisitions of financially underperforming health plans have stable membership and revenue, but provide opportunity for margin improvement, operating leverage and membership growth. As a result of the YourCare acquisition, we will serve approximately 46,000 Medicaid members in seven counties in Western New York with annual revenues of approximately $285 million. The purchase price is approximately $40 million. In the NextLevel transaction, we will serve over 50,000 Medicaid and LTSS members in Cook County, Illinois with annual revenue of approximately $270 million. The purchase price is approximately $50 million. We will fund these acquisitions with available cash and both are expected to close in the first half of the year, enhancing our premium revenue growth rate for 2020. In New Mexico, we have been working on a special situation, which is a discrete program building an unmet need. The Navajo Nation in New Mexico has passed legislation to create the first Native American managed care entity and further, the legislation stipulates that the Navajo Nation partner with Molina to operate the plan. Pursuant to that legislation, the business arm of the Navajo Nation will contract with us to develop a fully-capitated health care offering under the umbrella of New Mexico's traditional Medicaid program. The new entity will be designed to improve access and quality of health care for the largest Native American reservation, as there are approximately 75,000 Navajos in New Mexico who are eligible for Medicaid. The program is expected to be operational by 2021. Turning now to an update on our Medicaid RFPs. In Kentucky, we submitted a high-quality proposal in 2019 in response to the state's Medicaid RFP and were selected as one of the winning bids. In December 2019, the new administration canceled the awards and rebid the contracts. We have already submitted the updated proposal that details our capabilities and local community commitments that were originally successful and therefore, we are hopeful that we will be successful again. In Texas, the STAR+PLUS RFP awards announced in October were disappointing to us. While we believe we have an excellent track record of service in this program and submitted a high-quality proposal, we also believe the scoring process was severely flawed. Therefore, we are pursuing our administrative rights. Our team filed a detailed protest which points out a number of fundamental flaws in the scoring process. We have not been given a time line for a ruling on the protest. We believe that the effective date of the new contract would be no earlier than January 1, 2021, so we expect to operate under our existing contract for the full year 2020. These and our other growth initiatives are anchored by our capital allocation priorities: first, organic growth of our core businesses; second, inorganic growth through accretive acquisitions; and third, programmatically returning excess capital to shareholders via share repurchases.  Now turning to our 2020 guidance. 2020 is the first full year in our pivot to growth strategy. It is a year in which we expect meaningful top line revenue growth while continuing to produce attractive margins. In that context, some highlights of our guidance are as follows: we expect to grow premium revenues by 7.4% organically and 9%, assuming our announced acquisitions closed by June 30. For the total company, we expect to produce strong after-tax margins of 3.7% to 3.8%. We expect to continue to improve our performance in the Medicaid business as we benefit from a stable rate and cost trend environment. In Medicare, we expect to grow revenues and maintain our attractive margin position despite the industry-specific headwind of the reinstatement of the Health Insurer Fee. However, we now expect a decline in the Marketplace profit pool for 2020 as the extraordinary 2019 margin performance presents a challenging jump-off point into 2020, and it is clear to us now that our membership growth expectations were too optimistic relative to our pricing strategy. We have enhanced our earnings profile by a measured deployment of excess capital. And finally, as a result of all of this, for the full year 2020, we expect GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $11.20 to $11.70. Our premium revenue for the full year 2020 is expected to be approximately $17.4 billion, an increase of 7.4% over 2019. This growth is within the 7% to 9% guidance range we gave previously, which assumed a steady state in Texas and no acquisitions. Assuming the YourCare and Next Level acquisitions close by June 30, premium revenue would increase approximately 9% year-over-year, an 11% increase on an annualized basis. 40% of our premium growth is attributed to member volume and 60% is attributed to rate increases and mix of business. We have a strong and balanced business portfolio, which produces a solid baseline for 2020 and supports our future growth. Now I will provide some details underlying our guidance by line of business. In our Medicaid business, we expect 2020 premium revenue to grow approximately 6.4%. This reflects the annualized impact of the RFP awards that we implemented this past year, market share growth in underpenetrated markets and net rate increases. Our expected 2020 year-end membership is an increase of approximately 3% over 2019 and 6% when including the membership of our 2 acquisitions. From an earnings perspective, we expect to produce Medicaid after-tax margins in the range of 3.2% to 3.4%, a slight improvement over 2019. The rate environment is rational and our rate advocacy efforts are working well. We continue to manage medical costs effectively as our efforts in payment integrity, network management and utilization control continue to offset stable, low single-digit medical cost trends, and we continue to improve our retention of at-risk revenue and improve our member risk scores. Our Medicare business is expected to grow premium revenues by approximately 12%, with our DSNP product growing by 20%. Recall, we filed DSNP products in 150 new counties in 2020, including entering 2 new states, Ohio and South Carolina, and gained market share in existing counties. We continue to progress toward our goal of having full penetration of our DSNP product in our Medicaid footprint. Our year-end membership in Medicare all-in is expected to be an 8% increase over 2019. From an earnings perspective in Medicare, we expect an after-tax margin in the range of 5.6% to 5.7%, including the Health Insurer Fee headwind of $22 million after-tax, which dampens margins by approximately 90 basis points. In this line of business, premium yields have kept pace with medical cost trend, we continue to effectively manage the high-acuity LTSS population and we continue to improve on our member risk scores. In our Marketplace business, we served 274,000 members at year-end 2019 and produced exceptionally high margins. In an effort to be more competitive in our 2020 product set, we lowered our prices on average 4%. We began 2020 with approximately 350,000 Marketplace members, a 30% increase from year-end 2019, including our expanded footprint in two states, Mississippi and South Carolina. We expect Marketplace revenue growth of 9.2% in 2020 with after-tax margins in the 4.7% to 4.9% range. Our Marketplace membership and revenue growth outlook are below our initial expectations, as the investments we made in product design and pricing did not produce the level of membership we had forecasted. This was particularly true in 2 markets, Texas and Florida, which comprised most of the shortfall to our expectation. In summary, we had competitive pricing in many, but not all of our markets, and we saw fewer members move for the same price differential than we had seen in years prior. We do, however, expect membership attrition to be lower than in past years, and thus, we expect to end the year with approximately 310,000 members, a 15% increase over year-end 2019. In conclusion, after another solid year of performance in 2019, we look to 2020 and beyond with confidence. We have a deep management team, a strong product portfolio, a healthy capital structure and a value-creating approach to capital deployment. We are and we will be a pure-play government managed care business. We are going to stay close to the core. We believe that the government managed care business has very attractive growth characteristics with compelling free cash flow generation. Now I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for more detail on the financials. Tom?
Thomas Tran: Thank you, Joe, and good morning. We report fourth quarter earnings per diluted share of $2.67, net income of $168 million and an after-tax margin of 3.9% with premium revenue of $4.1 billion. Let me provide some additional detail on the quarter. My commentary will be focused on a sequential quarter comparison. The consolidated MCR for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 86% compared to 86.3% in the third quarter, primarily due to improved results in Medicaid. Prior period reserve development in the quarter was negligible.  More specifically, in the Medicaid business, our MCR for the quarter improved 80 basis points sequentially to 87.3%, producing an after-tax margin of 3.6%. We continue to perform well in Medicaid. Our Medicare business continued to perform well in the quarter. The MCR for the quarter of 85.5% was stable compared to 85.6% in the third quarter of 2019, producing an after-tax margin of 5.5%. Finally, our Marketplace business continued to perform well and generally in line with seasonal expectations as we report an MCR for the quarter of 73.5% compared to 71.2% in the third quarter of 2019, producing an after-tax margin of 4.5%. Regarding influenza, costs were higher in the current quarter compared to the same quarter in the prior year, but the overall impact was not significant. The G&A ratio for the fourth quarter of 2019 increased by 40 basis points to 8% compared to 7.6% in the third quarter of 2019, due mainly to spending on sales and marketing during the open enrollment for Medicare and Marketplace. Turning to our balance sheet, cash flow and cash position for the quarter. Our reserve approach is consistent with prior quarters, and our reserve position remains strong. Days in claim payable represents 50 days of medical cost expense compared to 50 days in the third quarter of 2019 and 53 days in the fourth quarter of 2018. As of December 31, 2019, our health plans had total statutory capital and surplus of approximately $1.9 billion, which equates to approximately 350% of risk-based capital.  In December, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $500 million. And during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 400,000 shares for $54 million. Subsequent to the quarter, through February 7, we repurchased an additional 1.5 million shares, bringing the total number of share repurchase to 1.9 million for $257 million. Operating cash flow for 2019 was $427 million, an improvement compared to 2018, primarily due to the timing of premium receipt and government payments. Our initial full year 2020 earnings per share guidance on a GAAP basis is in a range of $11.20 to $11.70. We have not include the YourCare and NextLevel acquisitions as this transaction have not yet closed. Our guidance assumes a steady state in Texas for the full year 2020, as we believe the existing contract will run through this year. Our premium revenue for the full year 2020 is expected to be approximately $17.4 billion, which reflects a 7.4% increase over 2019. If the YourCare and NextLevel acquisition were to close by June 30, premium revenue would increase approximately 9% year-over-year and the earnings impact for 2020 from the 2 acquisition would be negligible. We expect the medical care ratio to be in a range of 86.2% to 86.4%. The increase over 2019 is primarily due to a higher Marketplace MCR in 2020. We expect our G&A ratio to improve to approximately 7.2%. This reflects revenue growth, fixed cost leverage and productivity improvements, offset somewhat by reinvestment in growth initiatives. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 31%, an increase from 24% in 2019, driven by the impact of the Health Insurer Fee. We expect after-tax margins in a range of 3.7% to 3.8%, primarily due to lower Marketplace margins that Joe previously mentioned. While we do not give quarterly guidance, I do want to point out that the first quarter earnings per diluted share will be less than 25% of our full year outlook due to the impact of the leap year and the timing of our capital actions. Lastly, I would like to announce that we will be holding an Investor Day on May 28, 2020 in New York City. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question today comes from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo.
Peter Costa: Really just wanted to explore the Exchange business a little bit in terms of do you believe that margins will deteriorate further going forward? Or are we at the end of it here with this year coming up? And then talk about the pricing situation with competitors. How much further do you expect price competition to impact that business' growth?
Joseph Zubretsky: Sure, Pete. We hit our price point on our Silver product, meaning we are number one or number two in about 50% of our geographies. We hit our price point in Bronze, either the number one price position or zero premium in about 75% of our geographies. So we didn't hit our price point in all geographies. And where we did hit the price point, fewer members move for the price differential than we had seen in years prior. So we didn't get the volume that we expected to get for the 4% average price decreases we put into the market. So 2020, the earnings reset. We earned $150 million, which was exceptionally high in 2019. That will be approximately $75 million in 2020. But I would say that 2019 felt more like $125 million a year and 2020 should have been more like $100 million a year. So the -- while the spread looks wide, I think the jump-off point in 2019 was particularly challenging. I think we need to go through the pricing cycle for 2021 to see where the margins land. We still have very high hopes for this business. It leverages our Medicaid footprint, our Medicaid network. Nearly 90% of our members are fully subsidized. So we're servicing the working poor -- serving the working poor. So it fits strategically. But let's go through the 2021 pricing cycle and see how we can grow the profit pool over time.
Operator: Next question comes from Matthew Borsch of BMO Capital.
Matthew Borsch: Yes. Maybe just a little bit more on the ACA, your Marketplace membership. And I'm curious, in Florida and Texas, is it a dynamic of price competition being more intense than you had expected? And you also alluded to members not moving at the same price point as you saw the move in prior years. Does that reflect the maturity in the market? Or are there other factors you might attribute that to?
Joseph Zubretsky: Matt, on the last point, it's the question of elasticity of demand. And I think where we misforecasted was the result of members moving as prices were moving up. As price increases were going into the market, members would move for $10 and $20. And I think as prices have now moderated and even declined, I think you're seeing less movement for the same price differential as the market, as you suggested, seasons and matures. As your members become more chronic and they stay with you longer, these high-acuity members are not going to move their health plan if they're using a lot of services. So I think the maturity and the seasoning of the market has something to do with it. On your first point, yes, in Texas, in certain places in Florida, we did not hit the price point that we tried to due to a competitive force. And as we reprice into 2021, we're going to look at those markets and try to capture the market share that we think we can attain.
Operator: The next question comes from Mike Newshel of Evercore ISI.
Michael Newshel: Maybe just a follow-up on the exchanges. I mean since the membership does appear less sensitive to price changes, is that going to change how you approach pricing next year in terms of optimizing margin versus favoring enrollment growth? And also just how are you thinking about the long-term targets on margin and revenue growth that you provided at the Investor Day?
Joseph Zubretsky: Yes. The balance that you referred to is what you need to titrate in this business. You're looking for how many members you can grow for the price point you put into the marketplace. And the favorable news in all of this is that while fewer members move, that also means that more members are retained. So we're projecting -- well, last year, we had about 1.5% to 2% membership attrition per month. We're projecting this year that to be more like 1%. As I said, as members stay with you longer, they're probably more chronic, heavy users of health care services and less likely to move. So I would say that, yes, as the market seasons, fewer members will move, but that's good for member retention.
Michael Newshel: How about the long-term guidance on exchanges? How are you thinking about that?
Joseph Zubretsky: I think we have to go through the 2021 pricing cycle. We'll look at all of the factors in this business. We'll look at our networks. We'll look at our broker relationships and our commission structures and then, of course, product design and price point. And we still think we can grow the profit pool, albeit off a lower base. We're not reforecasting the long-term margin picture for the business, although suffice it to say, it probably will take longer to get there than we had originally forecasted.
Operator: The next question comes from Steve Tanal of Goldman Sachs.
Stephen Tanal: Maybe just a couple of quick ones on the guidance and then one on the marketplace. So just wanted to understand, is prior period developing -- our prior year development now included in the guidance? And if so, is that at a similar level to '19? I think it was about $0.98 in the first half of the year.
Joseph Zubretsky: Prior year development is not included in our 2020 guidance.
Stephen Tanal: Perfect. And then the Texas STAR+PLUS. Can you give us a sense of what amount of sort of revenue and net earnings would be lost if the appeal, the award doesn't go as planned? Kind of on an annualized basis just so we have a sense of what that delta would look like?
Joseph Zubretsky: Well, right now, as the department has published, if they went through the awards, the contract -- new contract would be effective on September 1, 2020. So therefore, it will be four months of revenue loss. And the Medicaid contract, that's approximately $350 million, and we estimate anywhere from $0.20 to $0.25 of earnings per share drag in this year. Now I wouldn't necessarily multiply that by three to get the full year impact because you just can't take the cost out fast enough. In one quarter, you're not going to take the cost out fast enough. So we need some time to readjust our cost structure and our fixed cost base to estimate the full annual effect. But for this year, $0.20 to $0.25 a drag in the latter half of the year through the last half of the year and $350 million of revenue loss in the Medicaid contract.
Stephen Tanal: Super helpful. Then just on the Marketplace. Wondering if you could comment on the MLR that's embedded in the guide?
Joseph Zubretsky: I'm sorry, can you repeat the question?
Stephen Tanal: The Marketplace MLR for '20 that's embedded in the guide?
Joseph Zubretsky: Yes. It's approximately 74%, up from 68% in 2019.
Operator: The next question comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research.
Justin Lake: I was hoping you could walk through your capital and balance sheet projections for the end of the year. Assuming the deals closed, did you expect the share repo that's in the guidance? Just trying to get an idea on the end of the year capital flexibility.
Joseph Zubretsky: Sure, Justin. And just to recap, during 2019, we were retiring the very expensive convertible notes that were in our capital structure -- that were getting more as the stock price moved up -- that were getting more and more expensive. So over a period of 18 months, we freed up $1.7 billion, and the notes right now are substantially gone. Now as you know, those notes have a dilutive effect on your share count. And so retiring those notes actually is a catalyst going into next year on the share count dynamics, as will be our share repurchase program having already repurchased 1.9 million shares. All that being said, we still have $1 billion of cash at year-end in the parent company, which means it's free and excess cash flow. We also have $900 million of undrawn debt capacity for a total of $1.9 billion of dry powder to fund our acquisitions, to repurchase shares and to grow the business the way we intend to.
Thomas Tran: The only thing I would add here, as Joe said, is that we expect to continue to attract dividend from our subsidiary as we continue to generate profit in 2020. So that additional dividend structure will also give us additional flexibility there to do other things.
Justin Lake: That's helpful. Can you tell us what you expect to spend on these acquisitions? I mean, we could figure out the share repurchase number pretty easily.
Joseph Zubretsky: Well, the tip we have under contract will be $90 million. $50 million for one, $40 million for the other. So total of $90 million for the 2 acquisitions. And then we still have $250 million left in our current share repurchase authorization, but we could top that up at some point in the future.
Justin Lake: And then just a couple of quick numbers questions. First, can you give us an investment income assumption for 2020? And then second, Joe, just to follow-up on the commentary on taxes. I just want to make sure you were saying that it's 20 -- would be $0.25 dilutive to this year, but it would actually be less -- we shouldn't multiply that by three to get to $0.75 because you'd be able to cut some costs, so it would be lower than that on a full year basis once you get the debt financed?
Joseph Zubretsky: I'll answer the second question first. Yes, that's correct. $0.25 of drag, if we were to lose the contracts on September 1. But we're still looking at how quickly we would reduce our cost structure. And so we -- I don't have a full year number, but I'm expecting it would be less than 3x the 2020 effect. Tom, investment income?
Thomas Tran: Sure. On the question of investment income, we love to get investment and other income. And if you look at 2019, it's $132 million. Third quarter happened to be higher than normal as we went through some restructuring of our portfolio. Typically, you would see roughly about $30 million a quarter. I would say that for 2020, you should see that number to be lower because yields have dropped significantly over this past year due to the FET fund had decreased a couple of times. So I don't have the number right in front of me. So let me just follow up with you right after the call. I'll give you the exact number.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Fidel of Stephens.
Scott Fidel: Question, I just want to ask something maybe a little more thematically. And Joe, interested in just your thoughts on just looking at the Medicaid RFP process more broadly and what transpired in 2019. It was a pretty messy year in terms of how the RFPs played out in a number of states when we think about North Carolina, Kentucky, Texas, Louisiana. Just interested if you think holistically, there's any broader takeaways around what we've seen play out in the Medicaid RFP process. I mean one could certainly look at each of these from a bit of an idiosyncratic sort of one-off dynamics in each state. But clearly, when you aggregate it together, it was just a difficult, much more difficult year for RFPs in general than we've traditionally seen.
Joseph Zubretsky: I think that's a fair point. And the specific sites you mentioned certainly have a lot of intrigue around them in terms of how they all unfolded. We don't view it any differently than we always have. We think nonincumbents have a reasonable chance of displacing an incumbent, which means you need to protect your turf and go after the new ones hard. We still think the ground game works. You have to be in a state a year or two before an RFP has dropped in order to hold the provider relationships, the regulatory and political relationships and really get to know the landscape, and we're doing that. So while I think this year, as you mentioned, might have some idiosyncratic noise to it, we still believe that the pipeline of Nevada, Missouri, Iowa, Indiana, Tennessee, Georgia, a little further out. We'll evaluate all of those through the screens we put them through, the friendliness of the regulatory environment, reasonable rate structure, the strength of the incumbency and ability to develop a network. And we'll take our shots and go after the ones we think we can win. So long term, I don't think my view of the growth aspects of new state wins has changed even though, as you suggest, 2019 was a bit noisy.
Scott Fidel: Okay. And then just one quick guidance question. Just your thoughts on the good range for operating cash flow in 2020?
Thomas Tran: Well, operating cash flow really fluctuate a lot. So that depends on timing of government payments. So we -- not only in good zone. We expect operating cash flow to be positive going forward. But every quarter, you're going to see fluctuations, and that's just the nature of the business we're in.
Operator: The next question comes from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research.
Joshua Raskin: Quick ones on guidance as well. Just as we think about adjusted EPS. Any difference in amortization expectations for next year? And then the share count reduction, sort of that 5% boost you're seeing. Is that share buybacks? I think it feels like it almost assumes a reauthorization of the buybacks as well.
Joseph Zubretsky: Josh, I'll answer the second question first and then hand it over to Tom. In 2019, we were retiring the very expensive convertible notes, which, as you know, end up in your diluted share count. So about 1/3 of our share count reduction is just the spillover effect of all the convert retirement activity in 2019 hitting full run rate in 2020, and the remaining portion is the actual reduction in the share count as a result of the share repurchase program. It does not anticipate any top-up to the existing $500 million authorization.
Thomas Tran: Yes. On the intangible amortization. If you look at the table we disclosed in the earnings release, it's approximately $17 million pretax for 2019. That number is going to drop a little bit in 2020. So I expect to be roughly about $0.17 to $0.18 per share for the full year versus this year, but roughly about $0.20.
Joshua Raskin: Okay. Perfect. And then you guys talked last quarter around some of your select -- some of the specific Medicaid markets, cost pressures and some high-cost claims. And obviously, no sign of that. No mention in the press release. Maybe any look back as to what the potential drivers were, what you guys were seeing? Or was any of that still lingering in the quarter?
Joseph Zubretsky: It really wasn't. In the second and third quarter, we did note some cost pressure here and there. The one that we were most aware of and concerned with was in Ohio due to 3 things: the behavioral carve-in over a year ago; the inclusion of IMD facilities in the behavioral benefit; and then, of course, due to redetermination, the acuity mix shift. As we've often said that rate advocacy is a very important part of this business, and we and the other participants in Ohio work with the state, got a rate increase in mid-2019 and then got a very significant rate increase for 1/1/20 going forward. So that was the one we are most concerned with, and we think that has largely been solved with our rate advocacy efforts and a nice rate increase on 1/1/2020.
Operator: The next question comes from Charles Rhyee of Cowen.
Charles Rhyee: Just two quick questions. One, going back on the marketplace. If you're seeing fewer members move because of pricing, is there anything beyond pricing that you can do to really differentiate the products to drive growth?
Joseph Zubretsky: Yes. There are some benefit design of dental, vision and what we call ancillary benefit features, many of which we implemented in -- for this cycle. And then, of course, they're your broker relationships and is your commission structure competitive and we'll broker loyalty, help move membership. So we're looking at all of those factors in our 2021 pricing cycle.
Charles Rhyee: Okay, great. And then -- and just going back to Kentucky. You mentioned that you kind of resubmitted the bid. Were there any kind of major changes when you looked at the revised RFP there? And can you talk -- maybe give us a little bit more thoughts on sort of what changes you revised for your bid as you resubmitted?
Joseph Zubretsky: Sure. The only changes to the RFP were two. I'll call them administrative matters, really. The questions on the capabilities did not change at all. But what we did, and I would imagine all of our competitors did, is you went back and looked at where you could absorb better and tried to shore up your RFP response, which we did. And as I said, I'm sure the competitors did as well.
Operator: The next question comes from Steven Valiquette of Barclays.
Steven Valiquette: So a couple of questions around the Marketplace. I guess, first, for the 2020 memberships that you mentioned, that Texas and Florida in particular were soft relative to your expectations. Is there any chance that maybe just the unfavorable headlines from Molina around your initial outcome in the Texas STAR+PLUS award may have hurt your Marketplace membership growth in Texas? And do you have any thoughts, I mean, on why you think Florida may have been soft? And then I have a follow-up after that.
Joseph Zubretsky: No. The dynamics in Texas and the two businesses are quite separate and distinct from each other under different regulatory regimes, et cetera. So no, we do not think that the Marketplace and Medicaid business had anything to do with each other. It was competitive pricing. You do the best you can. It's a blind bid. You try to predict where your competitors are going. And as I said, I think the good news is we did hit in 50% of our Silver geographies and in 75% of our Bronze geographies. So we hit the price point in many places. We'll try to do better next year. And hopefully, the attrition rate will stick, and we'll have sticky membership, and profitable going forward.
Steven Valiquette: Okay. And then just quickly again for Marketplace. I mean you mentioned last month in January that 80% of the 350,000 members are renewals or retained, which you mentioned gave you stability and visibility on the MLR. Just to kind of explore this a little for this whole discussion around less new members for '20 leading to lower margins. I mean, is it possible that just a larger percent of your marketplace book, because it's retained members, is maybe hitting up on MLR floors in 2020 than what you expected and that is what is mechanically making the net margins come in a little lower than expected? Or is that not really what you're seeing?
Joseph Zubretsky: In 2019, we are at the minimum MLR in one state, New Mexico. We have been for 2 years now. And as you know, the 2017 year -- it's a 3-year rolling calculation. The 2017 was a particularly poor year. And as we just announced, the 2019 was an exceptionally good year. So that will put pressure on the new MLR in a couple of additional states, but it's really not material to the overall story on the margin. It's really the product -- sorry, the volume pricing equation that is the larger part of the story, not the minimum MLR.
Operator: The next question comes from Gary Taylor of JPMorgan.
Gary Taylor: Most of my questions have been answered. I just want to go back to Medicaid margins for next year a little bit. I think up 10 basis points is your guidance. And you had mentioned some rate increases in Ohio. So I've noted those. I guess my question is, what have you contemplated for 2020 in terms of just the redetermination environment in general, getting better, worse, staying the same? And with this Trump public charge rule now being allowed to take effect at least while it's being litigated, what are your thoughts on whether that has any impact in terms of enrollment and margins?
Joseph Zubretsky: Gary, on the last part of your question, the public charge redetermination, the impact on 2020. We certainly took all of that into consideration. And we saw membership stabilize in the last half of the year. The quarter-over-quarter sequential membership in Medicaid has pretty much held steady. And so many of the significant redetermination efforts that were going on, on Michigan and particularly Ohio, have moderated. Certainly, the public charges, we're aware of it. 3 of our states, California, Texas and Illinois in particular have high concentrations of the populations that are subject to it. But Department of Homeland Security only estimates that 140,000 people nationwide are really affected by it, but the chilling effect is something we're aware of and we certainly considered in our guidance. With respect to rate and profit improvement. It was not just Ohio. We actually did well on rates in many of our geographies. As I said, the rate environment is stable. It's very rational. It's actually really sound. And in just about all of our geographies, rate not only kept pace with low single-digit medical cost trend, it exceeded it in some places. So that helps margins in 2020. And also, we continue to pound away at our profit improvement initiatives. Payment integrity, utilization control, better risk scores all contribute to the profitability of both the Medicare and the Medicaid book of business. So we're pretty confident we can maintain this margin position in 2020 and perhaps beyond.
Gary Taylor: One other question, if I could, just on prior year development. Your GAAP earnings guidance roughly flat year-over-year is hurdling almost $1 of excess development that you're assuming does not recur. And I know -- I think that $0.98 is higher than it's been historically the last few years. But could you just remind us on maybe what lines of business were the largest contributors to that $0.98 or roughly $1 just so we can think about that a little bit heading into 2020?
Thomas Tran: Sure. Most of the favorable development that we have reported throughout 2019 were related to Medicaid business.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America.
Kevin Fischbeck: Great. So I just want to go back to these changes for a few minutes. It sounds like you're saying that the delta versus your expectations on the Exchange is really about membership rather than margin. So are you saying that the margin is more or less in line with kind of what you expected when you were pricing the business last year?
Joseph Zubretsky: No, Kevin. We expected the margin to be more -- closer to the long-term guidance range that we gave you. So we're certainly coming in lower. But as we said many times, you can't have a conversation about margin or membership without the companion statement. Our goal is to grow the profit pool and growing it off of the $75 million base will be pretty important to our earnings growth story going forward. So every single year we go into the pricing cycle. We'll try to sort through the competitive forces. We'll work with our broker relationships, and our goal is to grow the profit pool here over time. Now whether we can get it back to the 8% after-tax margin range we had originally forecasted, it will take some time to get there. But as we go into the 2021 pricing cycle, we'll know more.
Kevin Fischbeck: And is it the minimum MLR? I think you said the minimum MLR was not a big issue. So if it's not minimum MLR being a big issue in 2020 that caused the margins to drop, what is it? Just growth in lower-margin markets than you expected?
Thomas Tran: Yes, Kevin, MLR does play a factor in the lower margin in 2020, but it's not really the major factor, if you will. As Joe mentioned before, we come off the 2017 bad year, off of your 3-year rolling calculation. So 2020, we expect to have higher minimum loss, higher, I would say, the rebate and more state than just New Mexico.
Joseph Zubretsky: But all of those factors played into the margin compression for the year. Number one, off of the higher revenue base, the operating leverage is significant. Let's not forget that. Your variable cost in sales expense is certainly there, but you're leveraging your fixed cost base. So the fact that we didn't hit revenue really, really hurt us in the operating leverage in this line of business.
Kevin Fischbeck: Okay. I guess, the fact that you already hit minimum MLR in more states, does that give you then a pricing tailwind into next year? Or are you now rethinking how beneficial that might be given that people there weren't switching for the incremental price differential?
Joseph Zubretsky: Well, when we go into the 2021 pricing cycle, we'll have to forecast. Again, here we go with 3 months into the year forecasting if we're going to be up against it in the state and take that into consideration in the pricing. And as you know, it's a 3-year rolling average. So you can't get it all back in 1 year. It takes time. But again, as Tom said, it's not a significant part of the story. We might bump into it in a couple more states than New Mexico. But it's just not a significant part of the story for this year.
Kevin Fischbeck: Okay. And I guess last question. So just basically, just to tie this down. The costs are coming in basically as expected. You continue to expect them to come in as expected. There's no cost issue. We're really talking about a pricing of MLR and membership growth issue, not a cost issue anywhere in here?
Joseph Zubretsky: Yes, I think that's exactly it. It's the balance of those three factors that you try to anticipate and price for. And this year, we misforecasted it and we didn't hit it.
Operator: The next question comes from Dave Windley of Jefferies.
David Windley: Listen and covered, but I have a couple. On the acquisitions, Joe, you mentioned that the relatively low margin, which gives you an opportunity, I think Tom in his prepared remarks said if they close by X date, they would be neutral to earnings this year. I guess I'm wondering how much of your playbook does that assume? Are they just naturally financially neutral and your operational execution would make that better? Or does that assume some operational execution? And how quickly -- you were able to execute the playbook pretty well in the organic business pretty quickly. How quickly do you think you can execute that in these acquisitions?
Joseph Zubretsky: We believe we can get these to run rate to our target margins after 1 year of operating them, whatever that year is. 12 months of operating them. And bear in mind, it's not just getting the $550 million of revenue to our target margin. I hate to keep talking about operating leverage, but it's real. These two properties in particular, 1 in upstate New York, is basically just folded into our existing infrastructure, and same with Ohio. We have a very large Illinois health plan. We need no more management. We fold it in, and we get the operating leverage off it. So it actually produces north of your target margins because of the operating leverage you get, and we plan to get to our run rate after 12 months of ownership.
David Windley: Got it. Okay. And am I right that approximate delta from where you're acquiring them to your target margins is a good 200 basis points or more?
Joseph Zubretsky: Yes. These two properties in particular are basically breakeven.
David Windley: Okay, breakeven. And then just for simplicity. To the share count question and the reduction in share count in 2020, can you give us after the retirement of the convert, after the buyback that you did in the fourth quarter, like what was the ending share count for the year as opposed to the average for the fourth quarter?
Thomas Tran: Yes. The ending share count is going to be lower than what we provided to you on the guidance table. So because as you buy share, it's going to flow throughout a number of quarters. And the number is probably roughly about a little bit less than 61 million share for the end of 2020.
David Windley: Okay. Great. And last question, on the comments about attrition. Joe, I think you had talked about fewer movers. My -- I'm interpreting that as movement during like an open enrollment period and during shopping. Do I also understand that you're translating that to, you think your retention within the year is going to be higher? And is the thought process in those two different kind of period the same?
Joseph Zubretsky: Good point. Our retention during open enrollment was north of 80%. So we ended the year with 274,000 members. 80% of those are now members inside our 350,000 beginning of the year membership. We also saw this last year. And you can see it in the medical cost. You can see higher use of pharmacy, chronic conditions using expensive drugs. So the members are clearly more chronic. You see it in the risk scores. You see it in the retention rate and the open enrollment retention rate. And therefore, we are projecting that we'll only lose about 1% a month, where in the past, we've lost 1.5% to 2% a month.
David Windley: Okay. And then is that higher chronic mix then consistent with what you expected in pricing and kind of MLR expectation? I presume you baked that into your guidance, but just to make sure.
Joseph Zubretsky: Yes, absolutely. And again, higher acuity members, as long as you get paid for them and get the right risk scores, higher acuity members are fine and can produce target profitability. So yes, we took that into consideration as we price the book. But we have to get the risk scores, and we're getting better and better at that every day.
Operator: The next question comes from Sarah James of Piper Sandler.
Sarah James: For 2020 guidance in Medicaid and Medicare margins. They're both well above peer average and your long-term guidance that you gave at I-Day. But the net margin of the company is still well below the midpoint of long-term guide. So I'm wondering if the 3.8% to 4.2% is still what we should be thinking about for long-term net margin guidance for Molina as a whole? And how sustainable are the heightened Medicare and Medicaid margins that you're experiencing in '20?
Joseph Zubretsky: Well, certainly, in Medicaid with a projection for 2020 of 3.2% to 3.4% after-tax, we believe that the Medicaid margins are sustainable. And again, all based on a reasonable, rational and actuarial rate environment. So that's the context for being able to sustain those margins and our ability to manage medical costs. On the Medicare side, bear in mind, our book is different. It's not traditional Medicare Advantage. It's DSNP and MMP. These are high acuity members, heavily burdened with LTSS benefits and we're very good at managing those. So it's a $2.5 billion book of business with starkly different characteristics than many of the larger Medicare players. So I don't think the comparison to traditional MA is the right comparison. But we believe these margins are sustainable in this area. And yes, you're right. It's really the margin rebalance in 2020 on Marketplace that has caused us to operate at the lower end of our long-term guidance range. And as we go through our 2021 pricing cycle for Marketplace, we'll make the determination as to whether that long-term guidance still stands or not.
Sarah James: Got it. And maybe if I compare the MA margins to your own book, because you're right about the product mix there. So they're running a good bit above the 5%, 5.5% long-term guide. And then you mentioned they're also absorbing 90 basis points from the HIF. So as we think about that book going forward, when the HIF falls off, can you add that 90 basis points back in? And how do you think about the long-term margin profile of your MA book?
Joseph Zubretsky: Well, clearly, when the HIF goes away for next year, it's a complete reversal. So you're right on that point. As you grow the business more aggressively, newer members that come on are going to attract a higher MLR. Typically, we see new members coming in, in the mid-90s, and the book as it seasons produces mid-80s. So if we start growing this book more aggressively, that will put pressure on the MLR, which will in turn put pressure on the margins, but that's all contemplated in pricing and in forecasting. That would be the dynamic that I would expect as we grow this book in the future.
Thomas Tran: This is Tom. There's a question from Justin Lake on investment income before. I just want to provide you with the data. 2020, we expect investment in other revenue to be about $35 million less than 2019.
Operator: The next question comes from George Hill of Deutsche Bank.
George Hill: I think most of my questions have been answered. I'll just tack 1 more on about the Marketplace environment. If you guys kind of went to market with 4% price decreases and weren't able to kind of get the churn that you were looking for, I guess, churn wasn't what you expected, I guess. Do you know what churn in aggregate looked like kind of across the market, inclusive of your book? And I guess, what does -- I'm trying to figure out, like, what do those numbers kind of tell you about the economic sensitivity of that market? And like what type of price decrease do you think is necessary to drive churn in that book and grow market share? And I recognize that there's a lot of moving pieces with that business.
Joseph Zubretsky: Yes. There are a lot of moving pieces. And one thing I would say is that, first of all, we did retain an open enrollment, 80% of our members. So we have at least our own data point. Hard to say what the competitors saw. But we believe this is sort of a dynamic as prices have now stabilized or even moderated and decreased the $5, $10 and $20 price differential. Keep bearing in mind these are nearly fully-subsidized members. So the Marketplace, 10 million members wide. We're serving a niche. We're serving these highly subsidized members. 86% of our members have some subsidy. About half of those have a full subsidy. And the dynamics, I think, in that market might be different than the Marketplace at large. The members, high acuity, and they're using services. They're less likely to move. That's a dynamic we've always dealt with. But I think as prices have moderated, members are not leaving for the same price differential they have left for in prior years.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as the conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-30 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to Molina Healthcare's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Trudell, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Julie Trudell: Good morning and thank you for joining Molina Healthcare’s third quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Molina’s President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky and our CFO, Tom Tran. The press release announcing our third quarter earnings was distributed yesterday after the market closed and the release is now posted for viewing on our Investor Relations website. A replay of this call will be available shortly after the conclusion of the call through November 6. The numbers to access this replay are in the earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made herein as of today, Wednesday, October 30, 2019 and we have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our third quarter press release. During our call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including statements about our growth prospects, our 2019 guidance, and our long-term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to view our risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K Annual Report for 2018 filed with the SEC as well as the risk factors listed in our other reports and filings with the SEC. After the completed prepared remarks today, we will open-up the call to take your questions. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?
Joe Zubretsky: Thank you, Julie and thank you all for joining us this morning. Late yesterday afternoon, after we issued our press release for the quarter, we learned the outcome of the Texas STAR+ RFP award. Before we discuss our quarterly results, we will first provide you with the information we have at this time. We were awarded contracts in two regions: our existing Hidalgo region, and one new region, the Northeast region. Given the real time nature of this information, a full analysis of the membership and revenue impact that is likely to occur at late 2020 is currently underway and will be completed shortly. We are naturally very disappointed in this initial outcome and are currently seeking more information from HHSC with respect to the awards. We will then decide on the course of action and exploring all of our options relating to the decision. Now let's turn to discussion to our third quarter results. Last night we reported earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of $2.75. We reported pre-tax earnings of $233 million and after-tax earnings of $175 million, resulting in pre-tax and after-tax margins of 5.5% and 4.1%, respectively. Based on our third quarter and year-to-date performance, we are raising our full-year earnings per diluted share guidance to a new range of $11.30 to $11.55 for the full-year. I will now provide some detail on our performance through the first nine months of the year. Premium revenue was $12.1 billion and in line with expectations as our membership remains relatively stable, our rates remain sound and our retention of at-risk premium continues to improve. Our medical care ratio was 85.7%. Despite some cost pressures in select markets, this MCR level demonstrates our continued ability to manage medical cost effectively, improve our claim payment practices and execute other profit improvement initiatives. The G&A ratio was 7.6% also in line with expectations as we efficiently managed our resources to provide excellent service to our members and providers. We continue to harvest dividends from our operating subsidiaries, resulting in nearly $800 million of excess capital at the parent company after paying down debt. We have a very strong balance sheet and a simplified and efficient capital structure. We have attained a fairly attractive earnings profile. Our medical care ratio for the first nine months of the year remains on track at 85.7% as the portfolio performed slightly better than expected. Total company after-tax margins of 1.5% are supported by 3% in Medicaid, 7% in Medicare and 12% in marketplace. We’ve produced average quarterly earnings per share of over $2.90 with minor seasonal fluctuations. We’ve approximately $800 million of free cash, which when combined with undrawn debt, creates a $1.7 billion investment capacity. And for the full-year, we are on track to report EBITDA of approximately $1.2 billion or a 7% EBITDA margin. I would like to provide some comments with respect to our 2020 outlook. At our Investor Day, we forecasted inorganic premium revenue growth rate of 79% for 2020, which now may change with the news on Texas. However, many of the elements related to that growth rate are still intact. Medicaid growth in 2020 will reflect the annualized impact of the RFP awards that we implemented this year, along with some expected Medicaid expansion. In Medicare, we expect growth in our D-SNP product from the expansion of our existing footprint and entry into two new states, South Carolina and Ohio. In marketplace, our analysis suggests that both our rates and broker compensation structure are highly competitive. Taken together, these factors give us confidence in our ability to grow membership. Inorganic growth prospects, we will continue to be an important dimension of our long-term growth strategy, because of the positive operating leverage resulting from membership growth and the synergies derived from our proven turnaround skills. Two weeks ago, we announced that we signed a definitive agreement to acquire YourCare Health Plan, a not-for-profit plan in Upstate New York. YourCare services 46,000 Medicaid members in seven counties in Western New York, contiguous to our Syracuse-based Upstate plan. This transaction, which we expect to close in early 2020 is indicative of the type of bolt-on tuck-in acquisitions that we discussed at Investor Day. Turning now to our updated full-year 2019 earnings guidance. Our year-to-date performance gives us confidence in raising full-year earnings per share guidance to a range of $11.30 to $11.55. This earnings per share guidance implies an after-tax margin of 4.3% to 4.4%, supported by after-tax margins of approximately 3% for Medicaid, 7% for Medicare and 11% for marketplace. Before turning the call over to Tom, I would like to say another word about the Texas news. If, in fact, this development does create a future revenue shortfall. Bear in mind that this team has demonstrated the ability to overcome many challenges. The team has grown margins to industry-leading levels even in the face of a significant revenue decline in 2019. We are committed to meeting the challenge again and we will continue to pursue the revenue opportunities that lie ahead. Now, I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for more detail on the financials. Tom?
A - Tom Tran: Thank you, Joe, and good morning. We report third quarter's earnings per diluted share of $2.75 supported by net income of $175 million and an after-tax margin of 4.1% with premium revenue up $4.1 billion. Let me provide some additional detail on the quarter. My commentary will be focused on a sequential comparison. The consolidated MCR for the third quarter of 2019 was 86.3% compared to 85.6% in the second quarter of 2019, primarily due to the seasonality of the marketplace MCR. Prior period reserve development in the quarter was negligible. The G&A ratio of our third quarter of 2019 improved by 20 basis points to 7.6% compared to 7.8% in the second quarter of 2019. The improvement in the G&A ratio was mainly due to the sequential increase in revenue. Interest expense were flat at $22 million compared to the second quarter of 2019. Let me provide some additional commentary on our performance in the third quarter by line of business. In the Medicaid business, our MCR for the quarter were sequentially flat and approximately 88%, producing an after-tax margin of 3.4%. This result were in line with our expectations. We continue to produce our targeted margins in Medicaid, while experiencing isolated medical cost pressures in certain markets, primarily due to acuity mix shift, benefit carve-ins and some loss claim activity. We fully expect that these cost pressures will continue to be managed and will ultimately end up in our premium raise. Our Medicare business comprising of our D-SNP and MMP products for the quarter continued to perform well and was in line with our expectation. The MCR for the quarter of 85.6% was fairly stable compared to 85.2% in the second quarter of 2019, producing an after-tax margin of 6.4%. More specifically on Medicare, we continue to demonstrate excellence in managing high acuity members by providing access to high-quality healthcare at a recent -- reasonable cost. This includes our market leading management of long-term service and supports benefits, which are embedded in our MMP product. We continue to see the result of our quality and risk adjustment efforts, as our Medicare risk scores are becoming more commensurate with the acuity of this population and risk adjustment revenue has increased. And our attractive Medicare margin profile allow us to reinvest in additional benefits, which should help us maintain our product competitiveness as we position this business to growth in 2020 and beyond. Finally, our marketplace business continues to perform well and is generally in line with our seasonal expectation as we report in MCR for the quarter of 71.2% compared to 67.2% in the second quarter of 2019. As a reminder, the margin profile of the marketplace business allow us to ease up on raise filed for 2020, increase value-added benefits and offer more competitive commissions, so we can grow membership next year at a lower, more sustainable, but still attractive margin. Turning to our balance sheet, cash flow and cash position for the quarter. Our reserve approach is consistent with prior quarters and our reserve position remains strong. Days and claim payable represent 50 days of medical cost expense compared to 48 days in the second quarter of 2019 and 53 days in the third quarter of 2018. The sequential increase in days and claim payable is primarily due to seasonal factors. As of September 30, 2019, our health plans have total statutory capital and surplus of approximately $1.8 billion, which equates to approximately 335% of risk-based capital. We reduced the outstanding balance of the convertible notes by $55 million during the quarter and $240 million since the beginning of the year, and only $12 million of the convertible notes remain outstanding and will be redeemed in early 2020. Capital deployment actions have result in lower interest expense, gain on repayment of the convertible notes and a lower share count on a fully diluted basis in the quarter, which decreased by 6% to 63.6 million share when compared to the same period in 2018. Operating cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 amount to $398 million and is higher year-over-year primarily due to the timing of government payments. Shifting to our outlook. We raised our full year 2019 earnings guidance to a range of $11.30 to $11.55 per share from a range of $11.20 to $11.50. This implies a fourth quarter range of $2.50 to $2.75. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Scott Fidel of Stephens. Please go ahead.
Scott Fidel: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. First question, just if you can maybe expand a little bit on the commentary on seeing some cost pressures in certain markets in the Medicaid book. Maybe just sort of discuss how many markets and geographies, products you’re seeing that? And then sort of what type of rate traction you’re seeing around some of those issues right now?
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, Scott. I would say the cost pressures that we're experiencing in those markets come across three dimensions. One, we did see in the quarter some aberrant and anomalous large case activity, which will abate. Second, we've seen an acuity mix shift due to some redetermination efforts, particularly in the State of Ohio. And those are primarily the reasons for the cost pressures. We believe that ultimately acuity mix shift ends up in rates. And in fact, the State of Ohio has been very reasonable and rational in rate discussions. And we believe that normal operating protocol such as utilization control, care management and looking at our network contracts harder will arrest some of the large claim activity. So there were pressures in various markets. Some of the behavioral carve-ins actually cause some rate pressure. You are never sure you're getting the right capitated rate when a benefit gets carved in. So we certainly saw some behavioral cost pressure in Washington, that will end up in rates. So acuity mix shift benefit carve-ins in some large claim activity. But all very manageable as evidenced by a very flat sequential Medicaid managed care ratio of 88%.
Scott Fidel: Got it. And a follow-up question just -- I guess sort of related maybe not just around the trends on the reserve development side. And I know you mentioned, you sort of had negligible reserve development in the quarter. I know you guys have had some pretty hefty development sort of trending over the last, let's call, 4 to 6 quarters. So, maybe sort of just update us on sort of the reserves and how you feel the adequacy is at this point? Did the reserve development get impacted by some of these issues in Medicaid or are there other factors to consider as well just around reserve development trends?
Joe Zubretsky: Take it to Tom in a moment, but I -- the reserve practices that we’ve -- that we undertake have remained consistent. I would say in the third and fourth quarter, your prior year reserve development should abate. Last year I thought was an exception. We had some reserve development in the fourth quarter of the prior year. I think that was an unusual phenomenon. So the fact that reserve development is over a $100 million for the year on a pre-tax basis, and has abated here in the third and fourth quarter is not unusual. Tom, anything to add?
Tom Tran: No, nothing more to add to that, Joe. Our reserve practice remain very consistent. We feel that our reserve balance is very strong. You can see DCP have gone up two days. And none of these issue on the cost pressure you see there, M&A into any particular issue for our reserve balance at all.
Scott Fidel: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Peter Costa: Good morning. Question about Texas. Your loss ratio in Texas is higher than some of your other loss ratios when I look at the government programs loss ratio. Is -- but it's hard to tell given the mix of higher acuity business, which you might have in Texas, well, that’s more profitable or less profitable than average? I guess another question is, is the contracts which you stand to lose more, more profitable or less profitable than your average profitability? And then the second question just what was that gave you the confidence at the Investor Day that the 7% to 9% organic growth rate would be there if you sort of weren't sure about the Texas result at that point in time?
Joe Zubretsky: Let me answer the second question, first. To be clear, at Investor Day, we said that the 7% to 9% revenue forecast for 2020 assumed status quo in Texas. So it didn't assume any increment or decrement due to a gain or loss. We are very clear on that point. So now as I said in our prepared remarks, as we do our forecast for 2020, if this award sticks and it incepts in -- on September 1, we would therefore adjust the 7% to 9% to allow for that 4-month revenue shortfall in Texas. Tom, you want to answer the question about profitability?
Tom Tran: Sure. We obviously do not petition out profitability by specific market and even down by line of business of market, but I will provide a following general comment. The acuity of the population in Texas is generally higher because of the significant portion of ABD and MMP population in the state. So almost by nature it's much higher revenue PMPM, if you will. So with that generally we run the tax that you saw we disclosed that at a 91% MCR in the press release. However, the business is profitable. Overall, our Medicaid business as you know hovering around 3% plus or minus on an after-tax. So in some state it may be less, some state may be more than that midpoint. So -- but the business there is profitable abate the fact that it may be slightly less than the midpoint, because of high acuity of the nature of the population.
Peter Costa: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Josh Raskin: Hi. Thanks. Just want to follow-up on a comment that you made, Joe, with the first question around Texas. I think you said that you will explore all your options. Now I want to make sure is that just with regarding protests and Texas specifically, or is that a broader Molina Healthcare commentary around as you kind of rethink about the long-term?
Joe Zubretsky: That was meant to refer to exploring our options in Texas. There is a -- there is business days to file a protest. That’s usually routine in these types of matters. But I was referring to exploring all of our options to review the scoring on the Texas awards. And then to the right set we have to pursue an additional award, we would pursue vigorously.
Josh Raskin: Okay. Which I guess leads to my second question, which is you talk last quarter around long-term targets of 10% to 12% revenue growth still being consistent with your views long-term, understanding the 2020 won't be in that range and EPS targets of 12% to 15%. And I know you don't have the scoring, so you don't know exactly what happened in Texas specifically, but is there anything that’s occurred sort of with the Texas, where you guys will have to take a step back, rethink long-term targets, rethink Molina's long-term strategy, or anything else in terms of just overall views for the company?
Joe Zubretsky: Our manage Medicaid duals high acuity. We do this really well. We're disappointed in Texas award and we will look at the scoring and as I said, we will pursue our rights. But nothing changes in our long-term outlook for the attractiveness of the business we're in, or the target margins that we’ve outlined for you. There is an inherent growth rate in this business that is very attractive as well. It produces significant excess cash flow and although we are disappointed in this award, we will reset our 2020 numbers and we will grow off of those and profitably.
Josh Raskin: Okay, perfect. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Justin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Just one follow-up with a couple of questions on Texas. First, in terms of the -- you’ve got a pretty big exchange footprint there, Joe, I would assume the good news is, it looks like your STAR footprint is pretty similar to your STAR+ footprint. So is it fair to say that even if you were to lose the regions that in the announcement in STAR+, you would still have an upscale to run a successful exchange strategy there, so that you wouldn’t need to exit the exchanges in Texas in any material way?
Joe Zubretsky: Okay. We have a lot of our exchange membership is in Dallas and Houston. We've proven in New Mexico that you can run a really profitable exchange business without being in Medicaid. And as you suggested, we still have the STAR CHIP contract and we think we have enough network growth and scale to participate in the marketplace business going forward. And the Texas marketplace business has been profitable and an attractive growth opportunity for us.
Josh Raskin: Right. And then in terms of the losses, I mean I know you’re going through the numbers. I’ve come up with something estimating close to just under a $1 billion of revenue that this low premium that this looks like. Again, no need to comment on that, because I know you’ve talked about Texas in terms of the potential for deleveraging on the SG&A side, if this were to go against you. And I’ve just wanted to kind of follow-up on that in terms of, if that number is in the right ballpark or you do lose a $1 billion of revenue, you think you could offset that SG&A and still hit your targets, or do you think that would also be a reset above and beyond just the margin contribution that -- that’s a risk here?
Joe Zubretsky: Various scenarios on what this might mean for revenue. But I would say the number that you articulated is certainly in the neighborhood of what could happen if we kept everything we have in Hidalgo and the Northeast gets split, let's say, evenly between two players. Those numbers are in the right neighborhood. But stranded overhead is certainly a phenomenon in this business. So just the fixed cost nature of the business, but we don't tolerate stranded overhead here and we’ve proven that in 2019. If you recall, in 2018 with the Florida and New Mexico losses, we said we had stranded overhead that we had to get at. And I think when you look at North of 4% margins across the board in this business, we've proven that we don't allow stranded overhead. We will get up the fixed cost when the revenue disappears and we will restore ourselves to our target margins.
Josh Raskin: Great. Thanks for the color.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Kevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask about the exchanges. You’ve had -- as a couple of competitors talk about their bid strategy and their expectation for margins for next year kind of coming down and at least one of them specifically saying that their view about the minimum MLR really was a main reason why they were doing that, but they’re operating at much lower margins in the near operating. I just wanted to -- just kind of recheck with you and make to see what your thoughts were about -- whether that at all is a barrier to growth either next year or in the next couple of years in certain markets? Just trying to understand why you’re upping it into a higher margin and not seeing the same potential kept to growth?
Joe Zubretsky: Well, the first thing I would say, Kevin, is it's obvious that '18 and '19 have been very profitable years for us in the marketplace and '17 was quite the opposite. So when '17 roles off to 3-year average in '20, that will certainly put certain markets up against the minimum MLR. The other thing I would say is it depends on how your portfolio performs. Averages can be misleading. It really depends on how your individual properties are performing. We have some that are performing really well and others less well. And so we will bump into the minimum MLR probably in a few markets. But we certainly consider that when we filed our prices for 2020. We certainly consider that when we were loading in additional value-added benefits to put value into the product then paying rebates, and we took all that into consideration as we filed our rates for 2020. And our preliminary analysis now that everybody's rates are public is that you have very competitive positions number one and number two, in about 75% of our key markets and our flagship silver product and our bronze product which is the products that we want to be competitive. So we are still feeling really good about our growth prospects in marketplace for 2020. As a reminder, we said we are going to grow the business albeit at a lower [technical difficulty] and still attractive margin.
Kevin Fischbeck: And you said a couple of times on the call today that your broker compensation is also, I guess, strong. Is that a change this year that you do something differently or are you paying more now in 2020 or for 2020 than you have in the past or is this just a comment that you’ve consistently been doing this?
Joe Zubretsky: Okay. We are paying market now. We are paying more, we are paying market. We weren't competitive on our broker commissions in a few markets last year and we’ve corrected that. So although we are paying more, we are not paying above market. We are now paying market.
Kevin Fischbeck: Is there anything that you think is kind of draw or share with us about that dynamic like in those markets where you’re paying below? Any view about what that means to go from below market to being in-market?
Joe Zubretsky: Well, I think as you know about 50% of the business comes through .gov and the other 50% comes through brokers. And broker want to be paid market commission, so we believe we will have good broker loyalty, we have a strong network. And now that we're paying market commissions, it should enhance the growth rate.
Kevin Fischbeck: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Stephen Tanal of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Stephen Tanal: Good morning, guys. I appreciate all the color, especially this early on the Texas RFP. And I guess, just wanted to follow-up on kind of the comments of stranded overhead. Joe, that was helpful, but I guess is it sort of fair to expect the earnings impact will be closer to the direct loss of what you're getting today as opposed to something larger than like the state makes available sort of financials for all the companies. And I guess the direct impact somewhere in the ballpark like 5% of EPS for looking at all that right using margins in the last reported fiscal year. So is that what you’ve managed to kind of just losing the direct impact, or should we actually think, well, even if you cut some stranded overhead, the impact could be greater for whatever reason?
Joe Zubretsky: I think I understand your question, but as I stated previously, certainly the margin, the fully baked margin on the product -- on the revenue that’s lost will disappear. And as I mentioned before, there will be fixed cost that will then become stranded, but we don't allow that to happen. And we’ve demonstrated that in 2019 we gave you at Investor Day initial estimates of maybe $40 million to $50 million of stranded overhead due to the New Mexico and Florida losses. And if you just look at our G&A ratios today, look at our margins today, I mean all becomes fungible at some point. But we’ve managed our G&A ratio was really, really well through this dynamic and we would be disciplined enough to do that yet again in late 2020 when this revenue phenomenon hits.
Stephen Tanal: Perfect. Thanks. And then maybe one for Tom. Just in terms of the guidance revision, two questions on it. One, could you kind of confirm sort of the level of peer performance EPS that’s implied there? And the other was more mechanical just the guidance hike on investment and other income. Any reason to think that's not sort of a 100% flow-through to earnings?
Tom Tran: In terms of the peer performance guidance, I think what you're referring to is there any sort of restructuring costs, or any kind of gain/loss on convertible, if that's what you’re referring to. And our EPS that we provided is all in. All of those item are in, okay? So in other words, we have roughly about a $0.12 of year-to-date net gain from the redemption of the convertible. So that said, that’s in the $11.32 to $11.55.
Stephen Tanal: Okay, great. And then -- sorry, the investment and other income piece?
Tom Tran: Investment income, yes. I mean it certainly -- we have provided guidance with high investment and other income. That’s a combined two items there. And that's -- we’ve seen a little bit higher investment income in the third quarter. So that's why we up the guidance for the full-year.
Stephen Tanal: And does that flow-through a 100%? That was sort of just I really wanted to understand, or should we be assuming that may be with the other income part of that, the flow-through to earnings is not 100%.
Tom Tran: The EPS, 100%, yes.
Stephen Tanal: Okay. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it.
Operator: The next question comes from Charles Rhyee of Cowen. Please go ahead.
Cal Sternick: Yes. Hi, Good morning. This is a Cal Sternick on for Charles. Just recognizing that you guys are fresh off of the Texas announcement and still working through your strategy, how are you thinking about your appetite for M&A going forward just in the context of the YourCare acquisition and maybe some of the additional capital you will have from pulling out of the Texas subs? And then just more generally on M&A strategy. As we think of M&A activity is being biased or is [technical difficulty] business like Medicaid or Medicare? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Sure. First and foremost, the best use of our excess capital is to fund organic growth. We hold about 10% of premium as regulatory capital. And the levered and unlevered returns on equity are superb. Second, we have a very, very capable M&A team. We are going to remain very disciplined. We will look for opportunities in our existing markets and in greenfield markets in our core products, particularly Medicaid, high acuity and duals and probably not traditional Medicare advantage. So we're going to stay very disciplined to our core product line. We really do seek out underperforming businesses because of our proven turnaround skills. We can harvest those performance-based synergies for our earnings stream and that’s a very, very attractive use of our human resource capital. So we are going to remain very disciplined. We still think there is opportunities out there. There's orphaned plans, there is provider owned plans, there is 501c3. And we are scouring the Universe for attractive opportunities to deploy our capital to accrete earnings-per-share.
Cal Sternick: Great. And I appreciate the commentary on the marketplace growth rates, recognizing that we are still early in the enrollment period for Medicare, I'm just wondering if you could talk about any visibility for growth there next year?
Joe Zubretsky: Sorry, on Medicare?
Cal Sternick: Yes.
Joe Zubretsky: If the question is on Medicare, as you know our Medicare is primarily centered around the D-SNP product and we have expanded footprint. We have spent -- entered into two new markets. So we expect to have membership growth in 2020. We do have some visibility against our competition now and we feel that the product will grow in 2020.
Cal Sternick: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Steven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So in Texas I know you don't have the scoring yet, but breaking down the awards by region, if we look at the fact that you lost in Dallas, Harris, El Paso, Bexar, Jefferson, but then you actually won brand-new business in the larger MRSA Northeast region. I guess I am just curious is there any -- really anything high-level that jumps out to you and what may have driven the new regional win, that was different mechanically than the factors that maybe in your mind, may have drove the losses in the other regions. So -- and tied into that, is there any silver lining worth pointing out with that one new that might help you in the other protest process as well? I know it's kind of preliminary and high, well, you don’t underscoring, but just curious any jumps out there? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: The answer is no, not at this stage. Obviously, the news is 12 hours old. Underscoring as you suggested has not been made available. But those are very legitimate questions and questions we will be asking, what did we learn about the scoring in the regions we lost? And what -- why were we successful in a branded region for us? So, no, we don't have any information at this time. But we will be seeking answers to those questions and then pursuing our rights that we have under our contract.
Steven Valiquette: Okay. All right. I maybe follow-up offline [indiscernible] more detail later. Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Sure. You’re welcome.
Operator: The next question comes from Matthew Borsch of BMO Capital. Please go ahead.
Matthew Borsch: Yes. I’m just curious about the episodes of MCR pressure in the Medicaid business. Is that something that -- and I think you had made some allusions to rate lag in the last call, but it wasn't particularly a factor. What’s been the timing of this emerging and relative to how the impact is played out, is that something that was sort of accelerating into the back part of the third quarter, or how would you characterize it?
Joe Zubretsky: I would characterize it as somewhat accelerating throughout the year. And I want to be very clear, when benefits get carved into a program, you do your best to understand the capitated rate you’re getting for that benefit. And sometimes it's right and sometimes it is not sufficient. So we’ve seen that in Washington with respect to the behavioral carve-in, we’ve seen it in Ohio with respect to the carve-in and the behavioral benefit that took place over a year-ago, and the acuity mix shift that has occurred and their redetermination efforts. So rates always do lag trend, but the good news is that our customers have been very rational and reasonable in understanding these cost pressures, and they have been included in recent rate discussions. And in fact, we had a midyear rate increase in Ohio to offset some of this pressure. So whether it's large claim activity, which is aberrant, whether it's the acuity mix shift, whether it's a carved in benefit, this is just managed-care dynamics and can be dealt with through operating protocols, utilization controls, network management and the like or in rate advocacy efforts. And the fact that we're still producing high 80s MLRS in the Medicaid business, 88% flat sequentially second and third quarter. I think is testimony to the fact that there is a lot going right in the portfolio even though we are seeing pressure in some isolated places.
Matthew Borsch: Joe, if I could just -- if we back up and look at the broader landscape of plans in Medicaid, seeing pressure in multiple markets. Is there any, I’ve realized that the eligibility redetermination is certainly a common factor. But it first feels a little bit like the rate development to sort of turned a little bit stingy coming into this year, and now we're going through what's likely to be some bout of corrections and certainly it's extremely helpful, but you’ve reasonable business partners in most cases. But is that a mischaracterization?
Joe Zubretsky: It's a legitimate question. But I think it may be slightly mischaracterized. The rate discussions have been reasonable, rational. Rates appear to be actuarially sound. And any time you go through, as I said, the phenomenon of a benefit carve-in or a significant shift in acuity, you get these little rate shocks, which then quickly correct. I think the good news on redetermination is something we ought to really focus on. In this business, there's been a lot of discussion over many years as how does the managed Medicaid business respond in economic cycles? We don’t have to model it anymore, we know. And the fact that the Ohio economy is very strong, the fact that expansion members who actually do work and make some money are making more money now and going back to work, that puts pressure on membership roles. It makes an acuity mix shift happen on your existing population, but then it's collectible on rates, that's actually a very positive phenomenon. The fact that the good economy is creating pressure in one state, but then it's correctable through rates quickly is a very positive phenomenon and we no longer have to conjecture and guess how these businesses perform through economic cycles, we know.
Matthew Borsch: Right. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Sarah James of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Sarah James: Thank you. On Friday, Texas HHSC announced that Molina took over as Head of Medicaid Procurement, which is unusual to do just before an award. And in general, there has been a good amount of churn on how is running this procurement for Texas. So, just wondering if there is any color you can share on how churn in this department could have influenced the procurement environment? And if it means that there's actually going to be a different team evaluating the STAR RFP and scoring?
Joe Zubretsky: Sarah, it's -- I hesitate to comment on what’s going on in the inner workings of our customer. Certainly, the churn or the turnover phenomenon you suggested is real. Everybody knows it, we know it. But I can't speculate at this point on what impact that might have had in the scoring. When we get the scoring, we are going to do what we normally do. We are going to evaluate it very thoroughly. We will go through lessons learned and what we could have done better, but then we are going to pursue our rights that we have under our contract to if we think we were not scored accurately or favorably, we will pursue our rights. But I can't speculate on what might have happened inside the department that created the scoring that impacted us.
Sarah James: Okay. Given where we are now the top line for 2020, is there any additional flexibility that you have in the timing of investment spend or bringing forward any of the outsourcing opportunities time wise, so you can influence the pacing of SG&A improvements to offset some of the top line headwinds?
Joe Zubretsky: As we continue to work down the path of developing a 2020 plan, certainly SG&A management is certainly something that's on our radar screen. We are not done yet. We think there's more efficiency in our operation that can be gained, but most of the large scale outsourcing that is going to take place here has already occurred. We did a very large-scale IT outsourcing last year as you know. We outsourced some of our very specialized and esoteric utilization management capabilities. We outsourced our nurse advice line earlier this year. So most of the large-scale outsourcing has been done, but not all of that is in the current run rate and that -- mostly that should be fully in the run rate in 2020, if that was your question.
Sarah James: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Styblo: Hi. Good morning. It's Dave Styblo in for Windley. Joe, the team has done really a commendable job of extracting cost from the business I think to the tune of $350 million to $400 million by the end of this year. And you guys have talked about another $350 million to $400 million of savings opportunities in the future. I’m curious, if any of those savings were earmarked for opportunities in Texas that might not now have an opportunity to be addressed because of the shrinking footprint for the RFP outcome?
Joe Zubretsky: Hey, it's a fair comment. I mean, without parsing the $300 million to $400 million of opportunity, I guess it would be just fair to say that its evenly spread across our book of business across our products and across our geographies. So, yes, if part of that was earmarked for whether it's G&A savings, payment integrity savings, care management savings, that whatever would have happened on the revenue that we lost will not happen. So I think that’s a fair comment. But we’re not going to start allocating our profit improvement opportunities to individual states and products. But it's a …
David Styblo: Sure.
Joe Zubretsky: ... fair comment. It's a fair comment.
David Styblo: Okay. And then -- and stepping back, I know you guys have started to talk about the revenue growth opportunities and have done that for a couple of quarters now with across different businesses. I’m curious, are there any RFPs that are larger in scale that I can add chunks of revenue coming up in the next 12 to 24 months that are in your horizon, that you guys have visibility on that, that you’re willing to disclose that you'd be interested in participating in from a bid perspective?
Joe Zubretsky: We have a fair number of, what I will call special situations, which at this time are still confidential, that we are working on. As you know, we submitted a response to the Kentucky RFP, that’s in process and we are told that will be announced sometime in the month of November, so imminently, and the other states we showed you at Investor Day, while RFPs had really dropped, Tennessee, Georgia, West Virginia, even Iowa to some extent, we are looking at. We have ground game ongoing in various greenfield states. We are evaluating opportunities. We’ve run every opportunity through a very disciplined set of screens. The regulatory environment, the ability to build the network, strength of the incumbency and the competition, and we will pick our spots.
David Styblo: Okay. And then maybe just a last one. I know you commented about some of the turnover within Texas. I'm curious the way that the two RFPs are evaluated for the STAR+ and the CHIP, TANF. What are some of the key differences that you might see there that might not cause kind of a similar outcome to happen in the next RFP award announcement coming up in December?
Joe Zubretsky: Well, time nature of this news, it's a very legitimate question and one we are looking at. But I just don't have an answer specifically at this time for you, but obviously, we will be looking at the similarities and differences in the scoring dynamics for the two programs. And we will take that into consideration as we build our confidence level on winning the second award.
David Styblo: Okay. Thanks much.
Operator: This concludes today's question-and-answer session and Molina Healthcare's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-31 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Molina Healthcare Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Trudell. Please go ahead.
Julie Trudell: Good morning and thank you for joining Molina Healthcare’s second quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Molina’s President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky and our CFO, Tom Tran. The press release announcing our second quarter earnings was distributed yesterday after the market closed and the release is now posted for viewing on our company website. A replay of this call will be available shortly after the conclusion of the call for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in your earnings release. For those listening to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made herein as of today, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our second quarter 2019 press release that we issued last night. During our call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including statements relating to our growth prospects, our 2019 guidance, our pending Texas RFP and our long-term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all in the forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K Annual Report for 2018 filed with the SEC as well as risk factors listed in our other reports and filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up and take your questions. Finally, as you may have noticed from our earnings release issued last night, we have enhanced our disclosures of information eliminating the need for a quarterly supplement. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?
Joe Zubretsky: Thank you, Julie and thank you all for joining us this morning. Last night, we reported earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of $3.06, pre-tax earnings of $257 million and after-tax earnings of $196 million, resulting in pre-tax and after-tax margins of 6.1% and 4.7% respectively on a reported basis. We are very pleased with our second quarter and first half performance in which we are demonstrating that we can sustain our attractive margin profile, while pivoting to top line growth. The business continues to generate significant excess cash flow and our revenue growth initiatives are well underway. We are raising our full year earnings per diluted share guidance by $0.60 at the midpoint of the prior range, with a new range of $11.20 to $11.50 for the full year. Now, some highlights for the first half of the year. Premium revenue was $8 billion and in line with expectations. As our membership flows have stabilized, our rates remain sound and our retention of at-risk premium continues to improve. We managed to a medical care ratio of 85.5% in the first half as we continue to demonstrate our ability to manage medical costs, execute strong rate advocacy efforts and continue to improve our claim payment practices. The year-to-date G&A ratio was 7.6% also in line with expectations. As we efficiently managed our resources to provide excellent service to our members and providers, all while continuing to invest in revenue growth initiatives. We continue to harvest dividends from our operating subsidiaries and have used the cash to pay down debt, lower interest expense and provide ample dry powder at the parent company to reinvest in growth. We have a very strong balance sheet and a simplified and efficient capital structure. Now some comments on performance by line of business. In the Medicaid business, we achieved an 88.3% medical care ratio and an after-tax margin of 3% for the first half of the year squarely in the range of the target margins we have forecasted for this business. Some specific points on Medicaid, TANF and ABD generally performed in line with our expectations and Medicaid expansion outperformed. Medical cost trends remained well managed across all medical cost categories as the result of our continued improvement and utilization management and payment integrity and we continue to improve on our retention of quality and incentive revenue. Our Medicaid business is performing well producing top tier margins and well positioned to grow. Our Medicare business, comprising our D-SNP and MMP products, continued to perform well as we managed to a medical care ratio of 85% for the first half of the year and produced an after-tax margin of approximately 7.4%, outperforming our expectations. More specifically on Medicare, we continue to demonstrate excellence in managing high acuity members by providing access to high-quality healthcare at a reasonable cost. This includes our market leading management of long-term services and supports benefits which are embedded in our MMP product. We continue to see the results of our quality and risk adjustment efforts. As our Medicare risk scores are becoming more commensurate with the acuity of this population and risk adjustment revenue has increased. And our attractive Medicare margin profile gives us plenty of flexibility to reinvest in additional benefits, which should help us maintain our product competitiveness as we position this business to grow in 2020 and beyond. Finally, our marketplace continues to perform well. We managed to a medical care ratio of 64.7% and an after-tax margin of 13.6% for the first half of the year. Specifically, the risk pool has seasoned and our medical cost is stable and being well-managed. We are capturing more accurate and complete risk scores. And as a result, we are paying less into the risk pool. And our membership is lapsing at the expected monthly level of less than 2%. These results and metrics were in line with our expectations and our prior guidance. The margin profile of the marketplace business also gives us ample flexibility to ease up on rates, improve the value-added benefit and pay competitive commissions, so we can grow membership in 2020 albeit at a lower, more sustainable, but still attractive margin. Now, I will comment on the first 6 months of the year through the lens of a locally-operated health plans. Our health plan portfolio has continued to perform well. Our operating model continues to pay dividends as we empower local health plans to drive frontline decision-making with strong support from centralized services and disciplined corporate oversight. California continues to perform well in its very diversified book of business and in one of the more complex network environments in the country. With 590,000 members, our effective medical cost management and low cost networks are producing MCRs in the mid-80s. As such, our California plant is poised to grow, particularly in returning to meaningful marketplace market share. In Ohio, with 297,000 members, we are generating solid margins, with a total book MCR of 88.2% for the first half of the year. The spike in Medicaid medical cost due to the introduction of the behavioral benefit and the higher acuity mix that came from re-determination efforts has been ameliorated by our effective rate advocacy in the state. We believe we are well positioned for the upcoming re-procurement. In Washington, with 811,000 members and a diversified portfolio of products, our margin position is returning to its historical level even with the confluence of significant membership growth due to our successful re-procurement and the introduction of the new integrated behavioral benefit. The higher medical cost trends experienced early this year due to the significant growth have abated as a result of the increase focused on in-patient stays and care management. In Texas, with 360,000 members, we await the announcement of the STAR PLUS STAR CHIP awards at the end of August. The continued excellent performance in our ABD business contributes to our confidence in the pending reprocurement. In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter and first half performance across all of our operating metrics, product lines and health plans and with respect to capital management. Now, I will address our updated and increased 2019 earnings guidance. We have had a strong start to the year and very good momentum as we head into the second half. Our margin sustainability efforts have clearly taken root. This gives us confidence in raising full year earnings per share guidance to a range of $11.20 to $11.50 with the $11.35 at the midpoint and an after-tax margin of 4.3%. This earnings per share guidance implies achieving medical care ratios of approximately 88% for Medicaid, 85% for Medicare, and 69% for marketplace resulting in after-tax margins of approximately 3%, 7% and 11% respectively. With these medical care ratios and after-tax margins which are in the top decile, we are taking a cautious approach to forecasting any further margin improvement for the remainder of the year. Many times the positive implications of favorable reserve developments are overlooked. As we continue to improve the management of our medical costs, we continue to outperform the medical cost trend assumptions embedded in reserving. This means our medical cost baseline and our cost trends for the current year dates of service could be conservatively stated. Our attractive and sustainable margin position that we have laid out in our full year 2019 guidance provides a strong earnings baseline as we pivot to top line growth in 2020 and beyond. I will now provide an update on 2020 and the longer term outlook. As I shared with you at Investor Day, we expect 2020 premium revenue to grow by 7% to 9% reported by growth in all three lines of business. This excludes any impact of the Texas RFP outcome, which has not yet been announced. Our top line growth initiatives for 2020 are well underway. In Medicaid, growth in 2020 will benefit from the annualized impact of the RFP awards, that we implemented and launched this year, along with expected Medicaid expansion growth in some markets. For instance, we have planned growth in Mississippi, Illinois and Washington and the potential for Medicaid expansion in Utah. In Medicare, there are more than 400 counties nationally, where we offer only Medicaid and our Medicare footprint is under-penetrated in approximately 65 existing counties. We have filed D-SNP pricing in 150 new counties for 2020, which includes enter into new states, South Carolina and Ohio. In marketplace, our 2020 marketplace rate bids have all been submitted. All of our submissions have not yet been made public. So, we will not be commenting on rates in specific markets. Our approach is to perform a very detailed market-by-market analysis to evaluate our competitive pricing position. We believe we have competitive products that will be priced well against the competition. We have maintained a very robust broker network and believe that our broker compensation plans will now be more competitive. Inorganic growth prospects are also an important dimension of our long-term growth strategy. And while we will never comment on specific opportunities, let me offer some brief thoughts on our activity in this potential value creating area. We expect to have $1.8 billion of investment capacity over the course of 2019. This comprises $500 million of cash currently at the parent, $900 million of presently available unused debt capacity and $400 million of additional dividends, we expect to harvest over the balance of the year. If available, we would prefer to invest in attractively priced blocks of membership in our core products rather than buying back our own shares as the operating leverage of membership growth is attractive. And we would prefer to grow our capital base rather than to shrink it. With our proven turnaround skills, we would also find value in acquiring health plans to harvest the performance improvement synergies for the benefit of our own shareholders. Our business development team is working the landscape hard to develop these types of opportunities. Nothing about our long-term outlook has changed since Investor Day except for another solid quarter of performance and increased confidence in our future. A recap of our long-term outlook. We are committed to delivering 10% to 12% revenue growth which will be derived from a combination of end-market growth in premium yields, actions we have taken our product growth strategy and from winning new territories. We will produce sustainable margins at a range of 3.8% to 4.2% with a midpoint of 4%, which is where we are today. We are committed to long-term net income growth of 9% to 11% and we are committed to earnings per diluted share growth of 12% to 15% after deploying the excess capital generated. We are and we will be a pure-play government managed care business. We are going to stay close to the core. We believe that the government managed care business has very attractive growth characteristics with compelling free cash flow generation. We aspire to be the lowest cost highest margin producer in this high growth industry. In conclusion, we are very pleased with our second quarter and first half results and continued progress this year. Margin sustainability, the second part of our three part plan is off to a very good start and we have launched the third phase that is to generate double-digit top line revenue growth. We are excited for what awaits us for the remainder of 2019 and beyond. Now I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for more details on the financials. Tom?
Tom Tran: Thank you, Joe and good morning. We report second quarter earnings per diluted share of $3.06 on a GAAP basis and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.11 excluding the amortization of intangible assets. Our pure performance earnings for the quarter is $2.91, which exclude the positive impact from the net $0.15 gain on repayment of the convertible notes partially offset by restructuring costs. Let me provide some additional commentary on our performance for the second quarter. Premium revenue for the second quarter of 2019 decreased 10.3% to $4 billion compared to $4.5 billion in the second quarter of 2018, which was in line with our expectations. Premium revenue for the second quarter increased 2.5% sequentially. The consolidated MCR for the second quarter of 2019 was 85.6% compared to 85.3% in the second quarter of 2018. Our continued focus on medical management, combined with a relatively stable trend environment, result in favorable prior period development of approximately $28 million pre-tax or $0.33 per share. The MCR for the 6 months ended June 30, 2019 improved to 85.5% compared to 85.7% for the same period in 2018. Favorable prior year period development for the first 6 months of 2019 was in line with the same period in the prior year. The G&A ratio for the second quarter of 2019 was 7.8% compared to 6.9% in the prior year. For the six months ending June 30, 2019, the G&A ratio was 7.6% compared to 7.2% for the same period in 2018. For both periods, the increase in the G&A ratio was mainly due to the decrease in total revenue year-over-year and was generally in line with our expectations. G&A expense increased in the second quarter from the first quarter of 2019 and was impacted by the timing of expenditures. Interest expense was $22 million compared to $32 million in the second quarter of 2018. The decline was due to continued repayment of debt. Turning to our balance sheet, cash flow and cash position for the quarter, our reserve approach is consistent with prior quarters and our reserve position remains strong. As we have stated in the past, at quarter end, we remain consistent with our reserving practice that result in favorable prior period development in the second quarter. As of June 30th, 2019, our health plans had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately $2.2 billion, which is well in excess of 400% of risk-based capital, which is yet another indication of the strong near term parent company dividend harvesting opportunity. We harvest $345 million of dividends in the second quarter or a total of approximately $635 million year-to-date. We plan to harvest approximately $400 million of additional dividends for the balance of the year. Together with unused debt capacity, we currently have over $1.4 billion of available capital for deployment and expect available capital to be $1.8 billion by year end. We reduced the principal on convertible note by $139 million during the quarter and $185 million, since the beginning of the year. Capital deployment actions have result in lower interest expense, a gain on repayment on the convertible notes and a lower share count, which decreased to 64 million shares from 66.7 million share in the same period of the prior year. As of June 30, 2019, our medical claims payable totaled $1.8 billion compared to $2 billion as of December 31 2018 due to the decline in premium revenue and a reserve on loss contracts have been paid down. Days and claim payable represent 48 days of medical cost expense compared to 49 days in the second quarter of 2018 and 52 days in the first quarter of 2019. The sequential decrease in days and claim payable is primarily due to seasonal factors. Operating cash flows for the first six months ended June 30th, 2019 amounted to $156 million and is lower year-over-year, due to the impact of timing of settlements with government agency and premium receipts from CMS. Shifting to our outlook, we raised full year 2019 earnings guidance to a range of $11.20 to $11.50 per diluted share, with the midpoint of $0.11 and $0.35 per diluted share or an increase of $0.60 per diluted share. This increase is comprised of the following, $0.15 per share net gain from the extinguishment of the convertible debt, partially offset by restructuring costs and $0.45 earnings per share outperformance, which comprise off, $0.33 per share of improved claim cost, reflected in prior year period development, which we do not forecast, and $0.12 per share from general outperformance for the balance of the year. Finally, our 2019 guidance does not assume any additional impact from prior-year period development, positive or negative for the rest of the year. While we do not normally provide quarterly guidance, a quick thought on the trajectory of earnings on the back half of the year. We expect that our third quarter earnings will represent slightly less than half of the earnings for the remainder of the year, due to the ramping of our profit improvement opportunities. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from David Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Julie Trudell: Dave, you ready?
Operator: David, your – David, your line is open.
David Windley: Sorry, just can you hear me now? How about that?
Operator: Yes, yes we can hear you.
David Windley: Can you hear me? Yes, okay. Sorry, multi-part question on rates. Joe, you’ve talked about the Medicaid environment being kind of better than average. Curious, if you still view it that way. Second, on your comments on risk adjustment and at-risk revenue retention, where do you think you stand there in terms of your recapture on at-risk premium? And third, in the exchange market environment, you talk about kind of easing your pricing in that environment to resume enrollment growth. Can you talk about the dynamic with such a high percentage of the enrollment subsidized, to what extent does, do changes in pricing have an impact on consumer decisions, in that highly-subsidized market? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Great, Dave. I’ll take those in order. We believe the Medicaid rate environment is very stable, rational and actuarially sound. We have been experiencing a medical cost trend in the very low single-digits in our Medicaid business. And rates have generally kept pace with the rate of medical cost inflation. With respect to risk adjustment and at-risk revenue, across all of our lines of business, Marketplace, Medicare and Medicaid, we continue to improve our performance and retaining at-risk revenue and that is obvious – emerging in the results in a very obvious way. So we continue to get better at, whether it’s quality withholds in Medicaid, whether it’s risk adjustment in marketplace, whether it’s star ratings in Medicare across the board, we are just getting better and better at retaining at-risk revenue. And as I said, it’s showing up in our medical care ratios. And lastly, yes, with the performance of our marketplace business, when the year is over, we’ll have 275,000 members, $1.5 billion in revenue and a 11% after-tax margins. There is ample flexibility to improve the value-added benefits we inject into the products, to ease up on rates. We’ve seen some of the rate filings in certain states and we believe our pricing for 2020 is well positioned us to grow versus the competition. So our prospects for growing the marketplace business in 2020 are seem to be moving along at good execution path. But we’ll know more when we see some of the competitive rates, particularly in the larger states like Texas and Florida. Hope that answers your question.
David Windley: Great, thanks. Yes. Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Peter Costa: Thanks. I wanted to ask about the TANF and CHIP business medical loss ratio. It seems like it deteriorated a little bit year-over-year. Others have talked about pressure in Medicaid loss ratios, what do you think the issue there – is it really just that the mix is no longer improving with tightened eligibility and no longer getting sort of the incremental people found from signing up for healthcare reform, meaning that you need a higher rate from states going forward or what’s happening in there that’s causing the rates not to keep up with trend?
Joe Zubretsky: Thanks, Peter. For the most part our TANF and CHIP business is performing as expected. And you’re right, in many states and for us, in particular – places like Ohio and Michigan, where eligibility redetermination efforts have been ongoing. It is fair to say that there is an acuity mix shift that occurs. Generally speaking, healthier people are the ones returning to work and the unhealthy population will stay on the Medicaid roles. So, you do get in acuity mix shift, not only in traditional TANF and CHIP, but in Medicaid expansion where the incomes are a little higher. So there is a phenomenon there, but I will tell you that for the most part, the states have been very reasonable and recognizing the acuity mix shift and our rate advocacy efforts have allowed us to actually get rate relief on some of these acuity mix shift. So, I would call it a sort of a mild trend that’s putting a little bit of pressure, but not really a phenomenon that has to be dealt with in a dramatic way.
Peter Costa: Okay.
Tom Tran: And Peter, last year, we didn’t have any Mississippi start up at a time so that also add a little bit to the start of business in Mississippi to our – if you compare Q1 this year – Q2 this year versus Q2 last year, so that’s another data point for you.
Peter Costa: Yes, great. That brings me to my second question which is, you have very high targeted margins in your businesses, but you don’t have as much growth as some others have. And where you have had growth like Mississippi or Washington and places like that. And you’ve seen pressure on your margins. Would you be willing to trade your high margin targets for more growth going forward? And can you talk about sort of the trade-off between growth and margin at least in the first year or two?
Joe Zubretsky: So, I would say on with Washington in particular when you grow 30,000 members, due to an incredibly successful re-procurement and there is a major carve-in of the integrated behavioral benefit there will always be some level of uncertainty as to whether the rate you obtained was reasonable and enough to capture the trend that you’re going to experience. If I consider some of these pressures that we’ve been experiencing, more benefit related then trend related and they will essentially and effectively end up in rates as they did in Ohio with the integrated behavioral benefit and the higher acuity mix shift that happened in the expansion population. So, in answer to your broader question about would we be willing to invest margins and growth? Yes, I mean, we do believe we can sustain these margins and perpetuity and start growing the top line at double digit rates. We believe our cost structure is very, very effective and we aim to be the lowest cost, highest margin producer and high-growth industry. So we will invest some of our marketplace margins and product features and pricing next year to grow, but we really do believe we can maintain a single-digit Medicare margin and a 3% Medicaid margin in perpetuity.
Peter Costa: Thanks and congrats on the quarter.
Joe Zubretsky: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you very much. Next question is from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Josh Raskin: Thanks. Good morning. Just two questions, the first is just, it is using about the three segments into 2020 and maybe even beyond, are there specific sort of margin resets? I know, you’ve talked about the pricing on the exchanges or in the marketplace for you guys. But in Medicaid or Medicare, are there minimum MLR resets? Are there state arrangements on profit? Are you sharing things like that or other sort of like technical requirements, where you would expect the margins to normalize, just based on sort of being above target margins? And then the second question just on the M&A commentary, certainly appreciate you guys looking for books of business and understand that rationale. Is that a commentary around the potential divestitures from Centene, WellCare? Or is that a broader commentary around provide your own plans and other plans in the marketplace?
Joe Zubretsky: Well, Josh, on your first question about margin resets in our three segments, the margins we’re achieving today are subject to all the caps and corridors that exist in the various markets. Various markets as you know, G&A caps, there are profit caps, there’s quality withholds, there’s all types of features to sort of regulate the amount of profit, you can earn in the 3% margin in Medicaid is subject to all of those puts and takes. So, I don’t see a margin reset coming in the Medicaid business at all, and Medicare and our MMP product, they have introduced a various levels of minimum MLRs that probably will change over time, maybe a little bit of pressure on the MMP product, but that’s the only phenomenon, I can actually think of, that represents anything close to profit pressure due to profit caps, corridors and the like. On your last comment on M&A, that was a very general comment recognizing the significant financial capacity we’ve created in a short period of time and returning to positive operating leverage. As a reminder, we had negative operating leverage last year when we lost the Florida and New Mexico contracts and we want to start creating positive operating leverage and there is significant operating leverage to create if we can attract books of business. So, as a recognition of positive, returning to positive operating leverage and the significant financial capacity, we have created. We would never comment on any specific situation with respect to M&A.
Josh Raskin: Okay, that’s helpful. Thanks, Joe.
Joe Zubretsky: Bye, Josh.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Justin Lake: Thanks, good morning. Let me just follow up a little bit on the – Josh asked about margins, just broadly on 2020. Can you, thinking about the run rate of earnings in 2019 into next year. I know for instance, you guys typically exclude the incremental PYD that you kind of called out so far year-to-date as a headwind to next year. Is there any other headwinds that you would want us to kind of consider and anything else you – we should keep in mind as we kind of look to 2020 in that, versus that 12% to 15% growth rate target that you have out there on EPS?
Joe Zubretsky: Justin, no, really. The good news about this year is when we print the final numbers, if everything goes as planned, it will be a very, very clean year, the revenue base, the MCR, the SG&A ratio, the margins we’re producing are all very reflective of the earnings power of the business. So we finally have a clean stable year, where we can step back, look at it and say, this is the baseline of which we will grow. So there really are no significant headwinds or tailwinds as we emerge into 2020. As we said with 7% to 9% premium growth projected for next year, we should return to positive operating leverage and the margins on that business should hold. So, we’re feeling without giving a forecast for 2020 which we’re not – we’re feeling pretty good about the trajectory we are on for the second half of ‘19 into ‘20.
Justin Lake: Got it. And then just following up, and I apologize if I missed this before, you talked about the 7% to 9% premium growth, were you able to give a breakdown of kind of where you see that coming from specifically, especially on the exchanges versus Medicaid.
Joe Zubretsky: We haven’t done it specifically, but generally what we’ve said is, we filed in 150 new counties in our D-SNP product. We’re only in 65 today. And we actually expect to grow market share in the 65 we’re in, because we are woefully under penetrated in those 65 counties, so we have good growth prospects for Medicare. And marketplace as you suggested, we will ease up on rates as you probably saw in some of the rate filings, where our margins today are outsized we can reinvest in the product, we’re going to do a better job pricing brands, we’re seeing a lot of people select brands over silver, because of the lower monthly premium. So, we’ll do a better job there, so very confident in our ability to grow the top line in marketplace. With respect to Medicaid, it’s mostly going to come from in-market extensions of run rates we’re creating this year. Mississippi run rating into next year, we’ve had a good year in Illinois and South Carolina, building our revenue base, due to better positioning in the auto-assignment algorithm. Washington, the growth that they’ve experienced this year will extend into next year. So, most of the growth in Medicaid next year will come from things that already exist today. So, it’s merely an extrapolation of the benefits that we’re enjoying this year, due to some end market growth.
Justin Lake: Thanks for the color.
Joe Zubretsky: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Sarah James of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Sarah James: Thank you. It seems like you’re the second company to flag this redetermination, and I’m wondering, if this is something that’s always been going on to this degree or if states are kind of approaching it with a new vigor and that’s why it’s coming up. And then you talked about being able to resolve any shifts that causes in mix through rate advocacy, I was hoping you could give us an idea of what the turnaround timeline on that is? Is this something that you typically will resolve in the first quarter? Or does it take a couple of quarters of advocacy to get the payments where you need them to be? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Sarah, on redetermination, I think there are a couple of factors at work here. One is, I think it’s fair to say that certain states have an increased focus on re-determination, which makes perfect sense. They’re spending tax payers’ money and they want to make sure that people on the role are actually eligible for Medicaid. So, there is an increased focus. It seems to have abated a bit. But secondly, we’re dealing with a very good economy and people are returning to work. And as they return to work, the healthier people will return to work and the sicker people who can’t work, will stay on the roles, which therefore creates the acuity mix shift that you observe. We can do, as a company, we can do a better job, keeping people that are going through the re-determination process. We believe that some of the softness in our membership roles over the past couple of years have been or because we’ve been lax and working with our members to keep them on the roles, should they continue to be eligible and they leak out of our, out of Molina into the system and wind up in other companies, and we’re going to do a better job, keeping them on the Medicaid roles if in fact they are eligible. On the rate adequacy efforts, the states are very aware of that healthier people go back to work and the less healthy people stay on the roles. A recent example in Ohio, where there was a rate advocacy effort to look at the re-determination effort that took place there, to look at the acuity mix that stayed on the Medicaid roles. And the market in general, including Molina has been very successful and making sure that rates have stayed commensurate with the acuity of the population. So, there is usually a lag time, but states have been very reasonable to observe that phenomenon. And had been agreeable to making sure the rates are adequate.
Sarah James: Got it. That’s very helpful. And one clarification, in the release you guys mentioned a decrease in marketplace risk adjustment compared to ‘18. Can you quantify how much that was?
Joe Zubretsky: I’m sorry, your question against, Sarah, risk adjusted on.
Sarah James: Yes, the marketplace risk adjustment that you guys experienced this quarter that relates to 2018. Can you quantify how much that was?
Joe Zubretsky: We haven’t quantified that. We if you recall last year, I understand your question now, last year we disclosed an amount that was very significant. I mean at the time that represented almost 25% of our earnings forecast for the year. So, we disclosed that these, we thought it was relevant. This year, the number was immaterial to the quarter to the six months and certainly to the full year forecast. So, we have not spiked it out and probably will not.
Sarah James: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Stephen Tanal of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Stephen Tanal: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. You guys have covered a lot of ground. So maybe just a couple of numbers questions here. Just on the prior period development, so you guys framed a $20 million to $28 million pre-tax in the quarter. I just want to confirm whether that’s net of offsetting reserve builds and what the comparable number was last year, just to understand sort of the year-on-year swing in MCR, if any?
Tom Tran: Yes, Stephen, it’s Tom. $28 million is primarily prior year development there for the quarters. And if you look at the six months this year, as Joe commented in his prepared remarks, it is pretty consistent with prior year in the same ballpark number essentially. And for the year-to-date numbers, it’s approximately in the zone of about $90 million in total, pre-tax.
Stephen Tanal: Okay. Got it. And that’s sort of the way you guys are defining that as net of reserve builds, correct? Is it the right way to think about that?
Tom Tran: Yes, we are consistent in our approach to reserve and that’s very, very fair comment.
Stephen Tanal: Perfect, thanks. And maybe just one more follow-up, just sort of on the Medicaid redetermination story, it sounds like the states are actually playing ball, which is great to hear. But I just wanted to clarify, are you guys actually seeing sort of off-cycle rate increases, where those issues are playing out or are you typically having to wait for the next renewal cycle?
Joe Zubretsky: Typically, you are waiting for the next renewal cycle and agreeing to a prospective adjustment, every once in a while, you might be able to argue for some retrospective rate relief, but generally speaking, it will wait for if there is a mid-year true up, it will wait for that process, and if you have to wait for the following year, usually that’s the way it happens. But every once in a while, you can approach a customer for a mid-year correction, if in fact there is a dramatic shift in acuity or benefits.
Stephen Tanal: Got it. It’s very helpful. Maybe just last one for me. Just on the MA sort of D-SNP business with particularly strong in MCR. I’m wondering, if you could give us maybe some specific commentary on what’s working particularly well in that business and then I’ll go. Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: It’s really just the fundamentals. We continue to manage high acuity populations really, really well. The membership is very stable and we continue to get a lot better at-risk adjustment and making sure that our, the scores that we’re achieving are commensurate with the acuity of the population and that continues to give us some lift. So, we’re just really operating really well in the fundamentals of the business and with our renewed interest in growth and filing 150 new counties next year and increasing our penetration in the 65 existing counties, we’re really bullish on our prospects in the D-SNP line of business.
Stephen Tanal: Awesome. Great to hear. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Matt Borsch of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Matt Borsch: Yes. I know you’ve touched on this. I was just hoping you could talk on the drop sequential drop in days claims payable relative to the favorable reserve development that you saw. And, just to put it in context, I recognize the track record that you’ve developed for conservative and favorable reserve development speaks to the integrity of your reserving process. But I just want to get a little bit more comfort on this stat, the reserves were replenished going forward given the drop-in days claims payable.
Joe Zubretsky: Sure, Matt. I’ll kick that question to Tom.
Tom Tran: Yes, Matt, you’re right. We are very consistent in terms of our reserving methodology. So, regarding the quarter end June ‘19, you see a drop of four days. And you look back last year, June 2018, if you compare that to March of 2019 is a similar kind of drop of roughly about four days. June is typically low utilization months and usually set your reserve based on that. And most of your reserve balance at the end of the quarter consists of the current-month. So that’s really the phenomenal of seasonality that I mentioned.
Matt Borsch: Got it. Okay, that’s great. Thank you, Tom.
Tom Tran: You’re welcome.
Operator: Great. The next question is from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser: Yes. Hi, good morning. Just a couple of follow-up questions here. First of all, on Ohio, because you keep coming back to Ohio as an example of a state where rates have been readjusted. So, the second quarter margins for the state reflect, kind of like the steady state margins or should we see margin expansion into 2020 as a result of this rate adjustment. That’s the first question. And then the second question, Centene on their call, talked about the ongoing process of divestiture and the discussions, so just any thoughts on that and any specific regions that you’d be interested in.
Joe Zubretsky: With respect to the profitability of Ohio, I would say that the rate adjustment that we’re getting is keeping pace with the new acuity and trend of the population. So, we’re not projecting any significant change in the margin picture that we’re presenting today. That rate was necessary to keep pace with medical cost inflation, so no change in the trajectory of the state of Ohio profitability. The rate increase that we were able to get helps us keep pace with the rate of inflation. And on the last question, we just make it a practice, never to comment on any specific M&A opportunity, but to repeat what I said in our prepared remarks. We had $1.8 billion of capacity and the desire to return to significant, positive operating leverage. We are very interested in books of business and membership in our core products and I’ll leave it at that.
Ricky Goldwasser: Thank you.
Joe Zubretsky: You’re welcome.
Operator: The next question is from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Kevin Fischbeck: Okay. Great, thanks. Just a couple of things, one is, you mentioned that I guess it sounds like the Medicare business is coming in a little bit better than you guys expected so far. I think you’re a little above your target margin there. Did you guys realize that in time for the 2020 bids or is that potentially going to be a source of upside kind of going into next year as well.
Joe Zubretsky: This profit picture was emerging as we were filing our bids for 2020. So that was taken fully into consideration, Kevin.
Kevin Fischbeck: Okay. So I think you said something on the lines of that, when you have favorable development that people might not quite appreciate how that maybe sets you up for additional upside kind of later in the year, it’s maybe just final more color then it’s kind of what you’re trying to domestic there.
Joe Zubretsky: Well, really, what I’m saying is that I think often times favorable and unfavorable development is just seen as sort of some actuarial phenomenon, when it really is performance-related, the actuaries have to use an experience period, where they’re looking at your medical cost trends and including those trends and reserving. And if you continue to outperform those assumptions by payment integrity routines, effective utilization management, your reserves are likely to run off redundantly and your medical cost baseline and trend used for the current year dates of service are likely conservatively stated, stated another way when you’re managing into declining trend, it can’t help, but be very positively from a financial point of view. And that’s really what we’re trying to message there that favorable development and a very attractive margin position that we’ve created for ourselves really is the product of very, very effective cost management across the board.
Kevin Fischbeck: Okay. And then maybe just last question, you guys have a lot of things going on from a cost perspective. You get the pharmacy agreement earlier, you talked about the integrity and risk adjustment, can you talk about what else is still kind of to come here over the next 12 months?
Joe Zubretsky: It really is more or less extensions of all the things you mentioned. We’re not done implementing all of our payment integrity routines. We have full run rate of our pharmacy, new pharmacy contract in our earnings, our IT outsourcing is now in the expense run rate. So, I would just say that more or less extensions of many of the initiatives we talked about before and that we showed you continue to show you at Investor Day. But no big other initiatives, other than the ones we’ve already mentioned, but more or less extensions of ones we’ve already begun to implement.
Kevin Fischbeck: Alright, great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Charles Rhyee of Cowen. Please go ahead.
Charles Rhyee: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Joe, you talked earlier about trying to make sure you’re keeping members on the rules, if they are eligible. For members that are no longer eligible, are you able to focus on them to get them into sort of an eligible exchange into the marketplace? And how is the stuff like been if that’s, if you’re able to?
Joe Zubretsky: There are subject the state rules are all different across these lines in terms of whether you can approach members for other products whether they can be one transfers, etc. And we obviously comply with those state rules and do the best we can to keep the Molina product, but it’s hard to answer that generally, all the state rules are different in terms of what you can and can’t do. I will tell you that when it comes to the member and it comes to the network, it’s critically important, and that’s why we love our product suite. Medicaid, Medicaid expansion and Marketplace as members move up and down, the scale of their incomes relative to the Federal Poverty Levels and they love their primary care physician and they like their network and love the Molina brand and how they cared for it. When they have a choice, they will stay with the Molina product. So, whether we can transfer them or not, many of these decisions are made by the provider and the member jointly and if they have a positive Molina experience, they will stay with the Molina product.
Charles Rhyee: That’s helpful. And then, and you earlier also talked about re-determinations. I think one of your peers talked about there relative to the states that they’re in, there maybe halfway through or a little bit more opportunities kind of going through this process. Can you talk about relative to your footprint, where the states are in terms of going through the cycle of sort of re-determinations?
Joe Zubretsky: I mean, there are always going through it, but we’ve seen, I would say in the last 12 to 18 months, most of the pressure we saw in our book of business occurred in both Michigan and Ohio. And I would say that is largely leveled out. And the fact that the re-determination leakage has leveled and then the Washington, Mississippi and South Carolina and Illinois membership has grown. Net-net we’re back into, we’re going to be back into positive territory on a sequential basis. When it comes to Medicaid member months. So, re-determination leveling, our growth initiatives started to take hold. I think we’ll be back into solid positive territory from a volume perspective real soon.
Charles Rhyee: That’s great. Thanks. And lastly from me, I think you mentioned a little bit about Texas, at the very start here, in terms of just timing if I’m not mistaken, right, Texas has kind of delayed decisions before had to I think, we bit again once. Any kind of additional color you can give like as to what’s going on, maybe in Texas, in general why, things are taking so long here?
Joe Zubretsky: No, I really can’t. We’re just we’re just subject to the whatever decision-making process that they have decided to take, the last we heard it’s going to be the end of August. We also believe that they’ll likely announce the STAR PLUS and the STAR CHIP awards concurrently. But we’re in wait and see mode. We remain confident, but we know nothing more than you know based on what you’ve read and heard.
Charles Rhyee: Great. Thanks a lot, guys.
Joe Zubretsky: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Steven Valiquette: Hi, great, thanks. Good morning, Joe and Tom, thanks for taking the question. So, actually two questions just on the marketplace quickly. One just a follow-up on the marketplace risk adjustment true up in 2Q ‘19 and while you’re not disclosing the number are you able to clarify whether the true-up was contemplated in the guidance for 2019. And then number 2, the marketplace MLR of 64.7% in the quarter, while it was up versus roughly 54% in 2Q, last year. Is still a pretty phenomenal number in the grand scheme of things, especially if it did not include any material benefit from any sort of risk adjustment true up you mentioned it could trend higher from here, which makes sense, but I guess, the question I’m just looking for a little more color on how this 2Q marketplace MLR stacked up versus your own expectations, just for the quarter specifically. Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: I’ll let Tom add some more color to this. But I think two perspectives Steven are important. One is that we true up our accruals in our risk adjustment every quarter. So, I think you can assume that not all of that was actually adjusted in the second quarter. Some of it was adjusted in the first. It wasn’t material to the quarter and I think the phenomenon you are looking year-over-year in terms of loss ratios, obviously, last year was benefited hugely, by that number. On a going forward basis, you’ve got to captured correctly, at 67.4% year-to-date, 69% projected we’re right where we want to be, it’s a very profitable book of business. It will produce over $220 million of pre-tax profits for the year and gives us a very solid baseline off of which to grow. But we are just getting better and better risk adjustment and we keep outperforming the assumptions that the accounts and actuaries use to account for the risk adjustment and that bodes well for the continued profitability of the business.
Tom Tran: Yes. I will add a little bit more color to the question you asked about last year, marketplace MCR at 57%. And last year quarter’s benefit tremendously by the marketplace risk adjustment and if you kind of normalize for that, then the MCR would have been around 67% and we are very comparable to what you see this year.
Steven Valiquette: Yes, that’s helpful. I quote it this is excellent, that was not that quarterly, so thanks for credit in that to you and thanks for the extra color.
Joe Zubretsky: Okay. Steven thanks.
Operator: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, our final question is from Gary Taylor of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Gary Taylor: Hi, good morning. Just a couple of quick ones. I appreciate all the comments today. Just trying to understand and I have certainly heard the comments about the re-determinations and so forth, but as I just look at and I understand this portfolio business that’s part of the answer. But when you look at TANF, in the first quarter, MLR was down 500, this quarter, up 120 and then expansion, the complete opposite first quarter MLR was up about 420 and then down 350. So on both quarters the trend that’s sort of offset each other. So, when we look at just how that’s progressed year-to-date, are we to think that there has been more rate adjustment in the expansion population or is that just much better operational performance in that population?
Tom Tran: If you were to look at parsing the different components of the Medicaid business, I would look at the 6 months versus 6 months, this year versus last year. If you look at that, our TANF and CHIP over a year-over-year comparison for the 6 month last year is actually improved by almost 100 and almost 200 bps. So and on Medicaid expansion, it’s fairly stable. And so we have had some rate efficacy in Ohio that came through in the quarter, so really help really bring the overall loss ratio for expansion business back to a more normal zone if you will. So on balance, the portfolio is really doing well.
Gary Taylor: Year-to-date I totally get it, just a little more quarterly fluctuations, I guess, maybe have anticipated, so just trying to think about that better. My last one would just be and maybe I missed this earlier we are talking about one state and I missed it, but just Illinois. So it was a good quarter, so I am going to pick on one where it looked like the MLR was up to just try to understand anything specific around Illinois for 2Q?
Joe Zubretsky: No, Illinois is doing really well. It will be a $1 billion business shortly and the margin recovery of last 2 years has been significant. In the quarter, if memory serves me correctly, there was a provider settlement that hit the quarter. One-off effect, Illinois is doing great. It’s got mid-single digit margins. It will have $1 billion of revenue soon and the prospects for growth there is very strong.
Gary Taylor: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today’s conference. Thank you for attending the presentation and you may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-30 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Molina Healthcare First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to Ryan Kubota, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Ryan Kubota: Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare's financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2019. The company issued its earnings release reporting first quarter of 2019 results last night after the market closed, and this release is now posted for viewing on our company website. On the call with me today are Joe Zubretsky, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Tran, our Chief Financial Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. If you have multiple questions, we ask that you get back into the queue so that others can have the opportunity to ask their questions. Our comments today will contain forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K Annual Report, our Form 10-Q Quarterly Reports, and our Form 8-K Current Reports. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab of our company website, or on the SEC's website. All forward-looking statements made during today's call represent our judgment as of April 30, 2019, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements, except as required by the securities laws. This call is being recorded, and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available at our company's website, molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky.
Joseph Zubretsky: Thank you, Ryan, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Last night, we reported earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of $2.99. Pretax earnings of $260 million and after-tax earnings of $198 million resulting in pretax and after-tax margins of 6.3% and 4.8% respectively on a reported basis. These results demonstrate we can sustain the attractive margin position we built in 2018. While certainly not conclusive, our first quarter results validate our position that durable, financial and operational infrastructure improvement can and should allow us to sustain these margins all while we begin to grow the top line again.  Our first quarter results represent a strong start to the year and a significant improvement over the $1.64 earnings per diluted share we reported in the first quarter of 2018. As you will recall, this time last year, we were just beginning to execute on our profit improvement plan, which had yet to manifest itself in earnings. While the year-over-year improvement in the first quarter is significant, for the remainder of our prepared remarks, we will largely compare our quarterly performance to our own expectations. Our strong first quarter operational performance and the trajectory of our profit improvement initiatives have allowed us to raise full-year guidance to a range of $10.50 to $11 of earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis, an increase of $1.25 from the midpoint of our guidance issued in February. Highlighting our results for the quarter on a consolidated basis, premium revenue of nearly $4 billion was better than expected due to better marketplace membership retention, coupled with slower membership attrition during the quarter. As expected, premium revenue has decreased sequentially due to lower Medicaid membership as we transitioned out of New Mexico as of December 31st and exited out of all but two regions in Florida as previously announced. Our medical care ratio of 85.3% was favorable to our expectations as the result of favorable prior year reserve development but more importantly improvement in our claims payment integrity process, frontline utilization management, quality and risk adjustment effort and the repricing benefit of our newly re-contracted pharmacy agreement. Our first quarter 2019 performance was positively impacted by our continued focused on medical cost management and a stable trend environment. Taken together, these factors produced favorable prior-year development of nearly $55 million or approximately $0.65 per diluted share, which we did not forecast in our initial 2019 guidance. These trends have continued in 2019 and as such our 2019 medical cost baseline and the trend off of that baseline so far have proven to be conservatively stated. We managed to a G&A ratio of 7.3% which was better than our expectations. We continued to effectively manage our expenses in the quarter despite the headwinds associated with lower premium revenue. As a reminder, we typically see higher G&A expenses in the latter part of the year due to costs associated with our profit improvement initiatives, as well as sales and marketing expense for the Medicare and marketplace open enrollment. Combined, the favorable medical care ratio and G&A ratio enabled us to deliver an after-tax margin of 4.8%. Now I will comment on our first quarter trends by line of business. The Medicaid business achieved an 88.5% Medical Care ratio and an after-tax margin of 2.8% in the quarter squarely in the range of the target margins we have forecasted for this business. Let me provide some additional insight into the favorable performance of the Medicaid business. TANF and ABD performed better than expected. While expansions slightly underperformed our expectations in the quarter due to some plans specific dynamics, which we will comment on later. Medical cost trends in general remain well-managed. Specialty and pharmacy cost trends ran lower sequentially, and we retained more quality, incentive in other revenue withholds. Our Medicaid business is performing well, producing top-tier margins and well positioned to grow. Our Medicare business comprising our DSNP and MMP products also started the year strong, managing to a medical care ratio of 84.7%, we produced an after-tax margin of approximately 7.5%, outperforming our expectations. More specifically on Medicare, both product lines, DSNP and MMP produced favorable results. We continue to demonstrate excellence and managing high acuity members by providing access to high quality healthcare at a reasonable cost. This includes our market leading management of LTSS benefits which are embedded in our MMP product. We are beginning to see the results of our quality and risk adjustment efforts as our Medicare risk scores are becoming more commensurate with the acuity of this population and risk adjustment revenue has increased. This excellent start to the year gives us even more confidence in our 2020 bidding strategy, and the competitive pricing and enhanced benefits we need as we expand this business by a 150 new counties in 2020. Finally, our marketplace business continues to perform well. Recall that for the 2019 underwriting year, we took a conservative rating posture to maintain our attractive margin position. We now have a scaled and profitable business that we plan to grow in 2020 and beyond. First quarter marketplace performance had the following highlights. We ended the quarter with approximately 330,000 members, which was better than our original expectations. We are generating and continue to generate more accurate risk scores and as a result we will likely pay less into the risk pool than expected. Our medical care ratio was 62.2% which compares favorably year-over-year and sequentially. Texas continues to be our stronghold, while California and Washington have both improved significantly over both periods. And we again forecast a seasonality to this business and as profitability as front-loaded due to benefit in product design. In some and most notably our current marketplace performance trajectory and margin profile give us flexibility to pursue profitable 2020 growth. Now I will comment on the first quarter through the lens of our locally operated health plans. Our health plan portfolio has started the year strong. As for the quarter 13 of 15 plans are meeting or exceeding their target margins. Our operating model continues to pay dividends as we empower local health plans to drive frontline decision-making with strong support from centralized services and disciplined corporate oversight. A few comments on our health plans performance. California, Illinois, Michigan and Texas, four of our largest plans had very solid quarters. Florida was a significant out performer in the quarter as it effectively managed the transition of it's across regions. In Ohio, our Medicaid MCR increased by 300 basis points from the fourth quarter, primarily due to a shift in the Medicaid expansion risk pool and a newly carved in behavioral health benefit, both of which were not adequately rated. We expect both phenomena to soon be reflected in our rates. Washington experienced higher medical costs from the Medicaid line-of-business compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 as a direct result of the new members we gained in our successful re-procurement and the plan wide carve-in of the behavioral benefit. This cost pressure will abate as the new members and new benefit mature. Turning now to our balance sheet and capital structure. We delivered approximately $290 million of dividends to the parent company in the first quarter. We expect to obtain approximately $500 million of additional parent company dividends for the balance of the year, including the excess statutory surplus from Florida and New Mexico. We have continued to improve the balance sheet retiring additional debt. Approximately $78 million of face value of 2020 convertible notes remain outstanding, as we continue to reduce our exposure to these expensive in the money converts that negatively impact our share count. In summary, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance across all of our operating metrics, product lines and health plans, and with respect to capital management. Now I will address our updated and increased 2019 earnings guidance. We are increasing our earnings per share guidance to a range of $10.50 to $11 with a midpoint of $10.75. This midpoint increase of $1.25 or more than 13% represents a solid $0.80 out performance for the quarter and a $0.45 raise for the remainder of the year. The $0.80 earnings per share first quarter out performance comprise $0.65 of favorable prior year reserve development, which we do not forecast as a matter of practice. And $0.15 of first quarter performance above our original first quarter forecast. The $0.45 raised for the balance of the year is backed by the momentum we have in all of our product lines as we project to exceed all of our previous guidance after-tax margin targets. I will now provide a quick update on the initiatives we are executing in 2019 for 2020 top-line growth. As a side note, we will spend more time on this topic at our upcoming Investor Day on May 30th. We have filed to expand our DSNP footprint in approximately 150 new counties for 2020. We are currently executing our 2020 marketplace pricing strategy and remain committed to measured growth ensuring that overall profit dollars grow even if that means lower overall marketplace margins. We are actively preparing for the Kentucky Medicaid RFP with resources deployed locally/ We have our certificate of authority and are building a network. We continue to expect incremental membership growth in our Illinois and Mississippi health plans in 2020, and we continue to have confidence in successful Texas Star Plus and STAR CHIP Awards in the coming months. Our successful margin recovery efforts have enabled us to focus additional effort on growth opportunities. We continue to evaluate new opportunities through state procurements, acquisitions of small health plans, benefit carve-ins and adjacent product expansion in our existing geographies. Let me briefly highlight what we plan to present for a week from now. We will provide you with a granular and detailed view of our top-line growth strategy, along with details of what we will sell, to whom and where in each of our product lines. We will provide you with our outlook for long-term revenue after tax margins and earnings per share. And you will hear from our executive leadership team about our ability to sustain our attractive margin position, our tactical approach to top-line growth initiatives, our robust capital allocation model, and other topics that support our continual drive to create shareholder value. In conclusion, we are very pleased with our first quarter results and our strong start to the year. Margin sustainability, the second part of our three-part plan is off to a good start. We have already launched the phase three, the top-line revenue growth phase and we are excited for what awaits us for the remainder of 2019 and beyond. I look forward to sharing more about our future growth plans and longer-term strategy at our upcoming Investor Day on May 30th in New York City. With that I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for more detail on the financials. Tom?
Thomas Tran: Thank you Joe and good morning. As described in our earnings release, we report first quarter earnings per diluted share of $2.99 and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.04 excluding the amortization of intangible assets. GAAP's earning per share of $1.64 in the first quarter of 2018 includes favorable non runway items of $0.38 per share, yielding pure performance earning per share of $1.26.  First, I will note that the two non-recurring items that occur in a quarter net to zero, resulting in first quarter pure performance earnings equal to reported earnings per diluted share of $2.99. Specifically, we recorded $3 million of restructuring expenses, primarily related to costs associated with our ongoing IT restructuring plan and a $3 million gain as part of the repurchase of the 2020 convertible notes and related embedded co-option terminations. Next, I would like to make some comments on our first quarter earnings performance. First, I'll continue focus on medical management combined with a stable trend environment result in favorable prior year reserve development in a first quarter of approximately $55 million pre-tax. Second, each line of business performs at or above our expectations. Third, administrative costs in the first quarter were lower than expected primarily due to the timing of certain expenditures. We expect administrative costs for the balance of the year to increase with higher cost from investment in infrastructure and increase sales marketing costs associated with open enrollment in Medicare and marketplace. Turning to our balance sheet, cash flow and cash position for the quarter. Our reserve approach is consistent with prior quarters and our reserve position remains strong. As we have stated in a past, at quarter end, we remain consistent without reserving approach and practice that result in favorable prior year reserve development in a first quarter. Days and claim payable was down one day sequentially to 52 days. Operating cash flow was strong in the first quarter and sequentially at approximately $250 million. As a reminder, cash flow from operations is impacted by change in working capital and a timing of large payments and government related balances. We are projecting strong operating cash flow for the full year. Turning to capital actions. As of March 31, 2019, we had unrestricted cash and investments of approximately $440 million at the parent company. We harvest $290 million of dividends in the first quarter and planned to harvest approximately $500 million of additional dividends for the balance of the year, including the excess capital in New Mexico and Florida. In a first quarter, we repurchased $46 million of the convertible notes leaving $206 million of face value outstanding. In April, we repurchase an additional $128 million of the convertible notes leaving $78 million of outstanding face value at approximately $240 million of current market value. That will be retired by this time next year. As of March 31, 2019 ,our health plans have aggregated statutory capital and surplus of approximately $2.3 billion which represents approximately 460% % of risk-based capital which is yet another indication of the strong near-term parent company dividend harvesting opportunity. Last week Moody's upgrade our senior unsecured debt rating to B2 from B3 and improve the company outlook to positive from stable. This upgrade is a testament to our focus on operational excellence, as well as the discipline and rigorous financial management processes, we have instilled across the enterprise. We are pleased that Moody's had recognized the progress we have made in a last year-and-a-half. We have continued to look for opportunities to delever the balance sheet. Our action in a quarter to retire certain convertible bonds reduces average diluted shares outstanding to $66.2 million at the end of the first quarter of 2019 from $66.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018. Shifting to 2019 revised guidance of $10.75 per diluted share at the midpoint of the provided range or an increase of $1.25 per diluted share. We outperformed our first quarter expectation by approximately $0.80. Approximately $0.65 was related to favorable prior year reserve development, which we did not forecast as a matter of practice. The remaining $0.15 was performance above our expectations for the quarter across all product lines. The remaining $0.45 is an increase to guidance for the remainder of 2019. Favorable medical cost trends, favorable first quarter results, along with our growing profit improvement initiatives suggest that the momentum and trajectory of the business have improved. Our practice is not to provide quarterly guidance, however, some framing comments are in order due to the shifting mix of our business and a ramping effect about profit improvement initiatives throughout the year. Our guidance suggests approximately $7.75 of earnings per diluted share for the remaining three quarters of 2019. The second quarter is forecast to be slightly lower than one-third of that nine months total. Finally, our 2019 guidance does not assume any additional impact from prior year development positive or negative for the rest of the year. All things being equal, if we have favorable prior year development as we did in the first quarter, our forecasts result will be higher and conversely a prior year development is unfavorable, our forecasts result will be lower. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first questions will be from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
ShehryarAmir: Hi. Shehryar Amir on per Justin. So Washington recently approved a public auction plan for the Washington exchanges where Molina participates. Could you give us your preliminary thoughts on this? How this new system will impact Molina? And how the economics will work? And whether the government plan will be completely outsourced? Thank you.
JosephZubretsky: This is Joe Brodsky. Obviously, there are various proposals at the state and federal level for public options single-payer Medicare-for-all type arrangements. Right now, we're considering most of these positions to be political rhetoric and at the discussion phase. I would call them more conceptual statements and philosophies rather than plans and until such time the plans become more substantive with real facts and real analysis to assess what the implementation would be, we're just continuing with the business as usual and as more facts come out we respond accordingly.
Operator: The next question will be from Ana Gupte of SBB Leerink. Please go ahead.
AnaGupte: Hey, thanks. Good morning, Joe, Tom, Ryan. So I appreciate all the fantastic quarter, appreciate all the comments on margin sustainability. I mean you're just crushing it, if you will, but I mean prior to you taking this on Joe, it was like very low single-digit net margins. Now you're almost 5%. You're guiding to 4.1 to 4.3. What is the sustainability number one on the prior development? And should we include that in our baseline as we go into 2020. Then secondly, your points around payment integrity, you had this announcement on Evercore specialty, your PBM margins and all of that. Is this all sustainable or will you trade some of this off as you go for more growth top-line into the 2020 plan year. 
JosephZubretsky: Thanks, Ana. And let me first comment on the prior year development. Every month every quarter we become more effective at managing our medical costs, and as you're managing your medical costs trend downward, reserves are likely to restate favorably. This trend has continued into 2019 which means the medical cost base line and the trend off of that baseline that we use to forecast our 2019 results have also proven to be conservatively stated. So the prior-year development is real and it's real testament to the fact that we are becoming better and better at managing our medical costs through increased focus on frontline utilization management, and re-engineered and revamped payment integrity routines. To that second point on payment integrity, the team has done a great job updating and making their modern, the stacks of technology we have to perform our claim at it. And it's creating real value without creating provider abrasion. The third part of your question was on specialty UM with Evercore. We have a new arrangement with Evercore. It's part of our co-sourcing and rent-to-own model of making sure we have access to best-in-class resources. They are going to manage about $600 million to $800 million of medical cost spend across a variety of specialty categories. And we're certain that over time that will create real value for us. The last part of your -- actually the first part of your question, but I'll address it last were the sustainability of the margins. We continue to generate profit improvement through the inventory of initiatives we've shared with you in the past. We are in a reasonable and stable rate environment. And our management team continues to execute with a great deal of discipline and rigor. And I would attribute the margin position that we have achieved and we believe can sustain to those to the confluence of those three factors.
Operator: The next question will be from Matthew Borsch of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
MatthewBorsch: Yes. Joe and Tom, if I could just ask in terms of the competitive landscape. Are you viewing any new competitors getting into your markets given not only your success and profitability, but some of other peer companies and given the backdrop that a lot of competitors were driven out by the initial exchange implementation? 
JosephZubretsky: Thanks, Matt. Are you referring to the marketplace or broad -- 
MatthewBorsch: I'm sorry, yes, the marketplace is what I meant.
JosephZubretsky: Well, the term marketplace can mean many things to many different companies. Our niche is to service the working poor. We operate in the demographic where 25% of our memberships are fully subsidized and 95% have a very ample subsidy. It's a pure leverage off of our Medicaid network and it's pure leverage off of the Medicaid pricing in our network. So we consider our marketplace business to be a mere extension, and a very valuable extension of our Medicaid franchise. Others that might be chasing some of this business might be operating with the mass affluent that a self-employed architect or accountant who might be making $200,000 to $250,000 a year. That's not where we are playing. This is a pure extension of our Medicaid franchise. And is creating real value for us. And as people move in to Medicaid, Medicaid expansion and marketplace and move up and down the spectrum based on their income, we have products that can capture that member and keep them in the Molina family.
MatthewBorsch: But maybe I could just ask an extension to that. Do you have any plans currently to go up in the income hierarchy in terms of your marketing approach going into 2020?
JosephZubretsky: No, not for the marketplace, but let me put a point on that. We do not plan to go up market into higher affluence in a more affluent demographic, but we do plan to grow the business in 2020. If you recall at this time last year before we had visibility into the profitability that we --that emerged in 2018, we were sort of compelled to put conservative prices into the marketplace, which actually proved to be very rich and it cost us some membership. Next year now that we have good visibility, 330,000 members we know where the margins are. We're going rating region by rating region, analyzing our price point versus the competition. If we need network changes will make them and we're very comfortable that with these margins and our competitive position as exists today, we can put a price into the market that grows membership, eases up on the margin percentage ,but grows the overall profit pool in 2020.
Operator: The next question will be from Joshua Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
JoshuaRaskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. First one just on guidance just a couple of quick clarifications from last quarter. I think you mentioned some stranded overhead in New Mexico and Florida of $0.75 and sounded like Florida was outperforming. So just want to confirm if that $0.75 is still there that comes off next year. And I think you'd mentioned sort of this negative spread between the Medicaid trends in the yield of almost $0.90 and again sounds like things are running better, so curious where we are on those two to start.
JosephZubretsky: Sure, Josh. On Florida and New Mexico I would say that the stranded overhead was merely to help investors bridge the progress from 2018 to 2019. If you recall when we gave guidance originally for 2019, we were projecting a 60 basis point increase to our G&A ratio, half of which was due to the stranded overhead for Florida and New Mexico. We're going to sort of stop referring to it as stranded overhead, it's in the baseline. It's in our SG&A and we're going to continue to chip away at it and manage it very effectively. The over performance in Florida was really managing the tail of the runoff claims more effectively than we had originally projected. In terms of the spread issue, I would say, first of all, the rate environment is very reasonable. We're generally able to obtain the trend and acuity factors that we need in rating when benefits are carved in and out generally the right amount of premium is moving in and out of our portfolio. And, yes, where we actually thought that rates were going to be challenged to maintain pace with trend due to our increased ability and efficiency in managing medical costs. I would say for the most part, our medical cost trend appears to be coming in on top of rate.
JoshuaRaskin: Okay, so that explains better and then my other --my real question here is just with the pending Centene-WellCare transaction, I'm just curious as you guys think about that in terms of opportunities for Molina. Do you think about divestiture opportunities should those arise? Any specific markets where their consolidation would have a direct impact on the states that you guys are operating. I'm just curious as you think about 2020 what do you guys thinking in terms of the potential opportunities for you?
JosephZubretsky: Sure. Well, in terms of sort of long term, one of the factors we look at, if you take on average that a state has on average four major players on their Medicaid panel. And let's say on average there are six major players chasing those four spots. It obviously makes the bidding map more likely for us to succeed as we try to plant new flags in new territories. So the bidding dynamics do change as one very capable competitor is now combined with another.  That's the long-term view. The short-term view, look, everybody is written on the speculation of which assets in that combination might have to be divested. I would say this, if that is true and assets have to be divested, if we are invited in to participate and looking at those assets and we are not in and of ourselves conflicted then we certainly would want to compete to secure some of those assets.
JoshuaRaskin: Okay and then just Joe, last one here. Any markets where you see potential market share increases for those two on a combined basis maybe not precipitating a divestiture, but where there's an opportunity for membership to shift as the market sort of rebalances.
JosephZubretsky: There are and I think we spoke about this actually earlier this morning. It would be really speculated about me to try to infer what a state might do due to the pending merger. Texas comes to mind, Kentucky comes to mind. There's going to be all kinds of-- Florida comes to mind. Interesting dynamics as this pending transaction unfolds. I would just say that we're confident in our ability to grow our business. We're confident in our ability to win new territories. And if the dynamics of this combination actually enhance our chances, well, then all the better.
Operator: The next question will be from Sarah James of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
SarahJames: Thank you. You talked about moving exchange pricing this year to target mid 60s to low 70s MCR based on what you know so far do you think that's where you'll end up in 2019?
JosephZubretsky: Well, we're certainly, Sarah, not going to give a forecast, but given where we're performing what I would say is that performing at the level we are performing currently with mid-teens pre-tax and still double-digit after-tax margins, gives us the flexibility to look at our price points versus the competition in various these rating regions, both on a gross basis and a net of subsidy basis, and tweak our pricing without the sacrifice of material margin position. So we can ease up on our margins. We can grow membership given the price point, the competitive price points that we have today. And that we can continue to have, given that we have all this margin to sort of play with. So the bottom line is we are going to grow membership, tend to grow membership next year. The margin lease up. The loss ratio will probably move up and our profit pool is projected to grow. And that's what we're going to attempt to do. And I think this very attractive margin position we've carved for ourselves gives us the flexibility to achieve that.
StéphaneHouri: Got it. That's helpful. And a couple questions on Ohio. First, with the behavioral health carve-in that you said wasn't rated correctly, but you expect to be fixed. If part of that retroactive fix or is it only go forward? Then last quarter you talked about expecting in Ohio RFP to be released later this year. Do you think that could include the LTSS product or are you just expecting it to be a repeat of what is already contracted out? Thank you. 
JosephZubretsky: Our latest intelligence suggests that the RFP will be a Medicaid only and not include an LTSS benefit going managed that's our latest intelligence. I believe there was actually a legislative proposal that determined that. With respect to BH, the benefit was carved in --the entire benefit was carved in 2018 and then they opened up the benefit to some IMD facilities, which everybody started using and it put pressure into our margins. And the state recognizes that. The state actuaries have recognized that. And we believe it will be included in the rate base.  There's always a mid-year conversation with Ohio. So it could go in mid-year, affected mid-year, best case would be to go in mid-year retroactively to the beginning of the year. We're not certain that's going to happen in the worst cases, it goes into the annual rating cycle that happens at 1/1/20. So Ohio is doing just fine. It had some cost pressure due to those two factors in the quarter, but it's doing just fine and effectively those costs wind up in rates.
Operator: The next question will be from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
KevinFischbeck: Great, thanks. I wanted to follow up on your comments about 2020 growth. I think you talked about 150 DSNP counties in 2020. I think last quarter though you're talking about 170 new markets. What was the change in that outlook?
JosephZubretsky: Just as you pursue the various counties, look at your network, look at density of population, which is critical. We decided to move forward with 150 rather than 170, which is not a material change at all. The DSNP product is very important to us. We manage it very, very well and we believe the product line is a growth catalyst for the company. So we're very bullish on that marketplace. We have the high acuity management skills. We have the distribution network. We've got a great Medicare team and we're very bullish on the product line, but the difference in 150- 170 is not material and it was really density of population, ability to build the network.
KevinFischbeck: Okay and then as far as the margin commentary, I think you're doing a lot of this outsourcing. I wanted to say, last quarter you guys have talked a bit about how some of these outsourcing is going to impact 2020 more than it was impacting 2019. I wasn't sure if any of the margin improvement that you're seeing is kind of pulling forward some of that benefit or you still expect a lot of these initiatives to keep adding significant additional cost saves going forward.
JosephZubretsky: Now the timing is really, really important. If you look at our first quarter results, the only outsourcing co-sourcing or rent own capabilities that actually had an impact in the first quarter were the repricing of our pharmacy contract clearly. And secondly our payment integrity technology stack and thirdly our improvement in risk adjustment and our relationship with Inovalon. The rent own capabilities that are being executed that have not yet manifested themselves in earnings, our IT outsourcing arrangements with Infosys and the arrangement that we just struck with Evercore for specialty UM. So more to come on that and every month that goes by the value, builds and compounds and that $500 million profit improvement portfolio we shared with you a few months ago is still alive and well and being executed upon. 
KevinFischbeck: But those arrangements aren't incrementally new versus the last guidance. I just want to make sure that you aren't after signing those things now including those in your outlook for Q3 and Q4, those are still kind of on the coming 2020?
JosephZubretsky: Yes. They have not yet provided benefits. They are -- they have been singed. They are being implemented but have not yet manifested themselves in the earning stream. That's correct. 
Operator: The next question will be from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
DaveStyblo: Hi, good morning. It's Dave Styblo in for Dave Windley. First question I had been is if you guys could give us an update on the guidance, where you talked about net margins being better across all three businesses. Is there a specific point that you could give us for those lines, as well as an update on --of the $550 million? How much of that is now in the 2019 guidance?
JosephZubretsky: Sure. If you look at our margin achievement pattern for the first quarter and what's implied in our full-year guidance, I'd give you the tails of tape as follows. Medicaid came in with a solid 2.8% after-tax margin, and it's projected in our guidance to be approximately 3%. Medicare came in the first quarter at a solid 7.5%, clearly an out performer. But we're projecting approximately 6% for the full year and marketplace came in at rather outsized 16% and we're projecting it to be solid double-digit at around 11% for the year all blending to the 4.2% at a midpoint that we conveyed to you. What was the second part of your questions?
DaveStyblo: Right the second part there is of the $500 million -- $550 million cost base the out year, how much of that is now expected to be captured in 2019 guidance?
JosephZubretsky: Well, we're not going to start parsing that every single quarter. We'll talk about it qualitatively. I would tell you that the risk adjustment, the payment integrity and the pharmacy contract clearly added value in the first quarter. Our specialty UM and IT outsourcing arrangements have not yet, but I think the numbers we gave you when we originally gave you guidance of $200 million and $100 million nett is still a good framework, that's included in our overall results, and will update you on the portfolio at our Investor Day in a few weeks.
DaveStyblo: Great and then just the last one, I know, Joe, you talked about moving into phase three of the plan and looking for more growth and you sort of highlighted a few things between the exchange opportunities and the DSNP expansion. I'm curious what other carving opportunities are there adjacencies or other new re-procurements. Can you provide more visibility or color on for us?
JosephZubretsky: Sure. And I can give you some color around what you're going to hear in a few weeks time. We look at the growth phase very clearly coming from our existing footprint. How to leverage the core business in our existing footprint, with our existing states as new product lines are introduced into these markets. That in it of itself with our very wide geographic distribution and now 15 territories with not all of the product lines in the market and certainly under penetrated compared to some of our largest competitors. We believe it gives us ample room to grow in our existing territories. We then have new states and new territories and with our rebuilt new business development engine, with our recent success at renewing business that we had with great proposal writing. We are very confident that we can start to win new territories as well. We'll talk about that a little bit, but very bullish on the growth of this business. We're in the right product lines. We're in the right segments and hope we will convey to an Investor Day that now that margin recovery and sustainability is well underway that we can start to grow the top-line again very handsomely.
Operator: The next question will be from Stephen Cano of Goldman Sachs.. Please go ahead.
StephenCano: Good morning. I guess I just had one more follow-up on the after-tax margin. So for just looking at the change in the guidance I guess Medicare is where you have the biggest sort of uptick. Can you give us a flavor for what's coming in so much better there? Is that obviously a very strong rate update 2019, but is that more about cost trend or things you're doing anything specific to call out in Medicare?
ThomasTran: Stephen, Tom here. There are really two factors primarily. One Joe mentioned a few minutes ago that we have done a much better job now. We're scoring with adjustment that also applied to a Medicare line of business and secondly is that we've been very effective in managing the cost line as well, primarily on a medical cost size. So it really impacts both sides of the house.
StephenCano: Perfect, maybe just one follow up, Tom, and this is probably more for you. Just the PYD, the $55 million pre-tax call out, $0.65 to EPS and then of course there's a table in the release which is I think our best way to try and track this that shows $189 million of a favorable prior period development. Is the difference between those two numbers sort of the offset, or would view as reserve building in Q1 and is there any way we can sort of see that number in any of the filings or try to track to it or is that -- am I thinking about that right and how should you --how would you tell us to keep tabs on all this?
ThomasTran: Sure. And obviously in the table you refer to now release also we'll see that in 10-Q when we file today as well. Essentially, you see the walk over from one quarter to the next and that includes the margin release each quarter and our intention every quarter to be consistent without reserve approach is a rebuild at margin. So if you net out the prior your development from that number the essentially the remaining piece is primarily the reserve margin that we intend to reinstitute.
StephenCano: Got it. Okay that's just not disclosed anywhere separately there right? So that that's sort of what really on these calls for it, I take it.
ThomasTran: That's correct.
StephenCano: Got it, okay. And maybe one last quick one, Joe, more for you on the marketplace. Just the commentary around sort of viewing it as --I think you said a pure extension of Medicaid obviously a very different margin profile right now and so how do you sort of bridge that in your head. Is --what's sort of the right level, if there is such a thing for the marketplace business or is it truly just what the market will support and how do you think about that long term?
JosephZubretsky: Well, as we mentioned many times both when we gave original guidance two months ago and just recently, we do believe that the right equilibrium can be struck where we can begin to grow the overall profit pool at a lower margin but at a faster rate. We were forced into this conservative posture because the business needed to be repriced two years ago, if you recall the 60% price increase on average I went into the market. And in last year, if you recall with only three months under our belt before putting new prices into the market, we had yet to see the very robust profit picture emerge in 2018.  Now that we've seen the risk pool settle, we understand who the 330,000 members we have and what their cost profile is. We can then use that as a great launching point to begin to grow the overall profit pool once again. Ease up on the price, ease up on the margin, create the right equilibrium, we have highly subsidized members where the price isn't as sensitive to their buying decision as it would be for a mass affluent individual. And it's a great business for us and except for the fact that it's brokered and run by the DOI in the States and looks more like an insurance product, it really is servicing the working poor who have incomes that don't qualify them for Medicaid. So in that way it is a pure extension of our Medicaid business and does really well for us. So the overall profit pool should grow at a lower margin and we think we have the flexibility to pull that off got.
Operator: The next question will be Peter Costa of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
PeterCosta: Hi, Joe and Tom, nice quarter, thanks. Can you talk about where the PYD is in this quarter? What business lines is really coming from? In particular I'm interested in how much relates to the exchange business and how much relates to the states that you're doing less business?
JosephZubretsky: Sure. We don't disclose PYD by product segment but it would be fair to say that with Medicaid being the lion share of our business, you see a good chunk of that within that line of business. 
PeterCosta: And does that relate to the states that you are doing less business in?
ThomasTran: Florida and New Mexico is a component of that, so we don't parse that out but Joe comment before we managed to run out very well. So a component of that probably you is developing this part of those two states.
PeterCosta: Okay, thanks. And then the G&A expense in the quarter, how much of that improvement is really sort of just delayed G&A expense towards later in the year versus your expectations from before?
ThomasTran: Sure. There are a number of different factors here. One is that we continue to manage our expense well from Q4 for Q1, you see expense went down roughly about $30 million in total. However, the ratio gone up a little bit maybe 20 basis or so. And then comparing to our own expectation is actually running a little bit better than our expectation and we manage our cost well. There's some timing of spending on infrastructure that will appear in second to fourth quarter. These primarily relating to investment in capabilities to grow our business. Joe mentioned DSNP marketplace investment in really provider and member enhancement to their experience as well as building up really upgrading a number of our technology facility as well. So that's how you're going to see that step play out over the next couple quarters as well.
PeterCosta: So let me put words your mouth relative to your prior expectation is just a little more skewed to the back half of the year than this first quarter. 
ThomasTran: That's right.
Operator: The next question will be from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Please go ahead.
StevenValiquette: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Joe and Tom. I’ll echo the sentiments of everyone else that these results continue to be impressive. The MLR trend in Medicaid in 1Q was pretty solid. I think everyone on this call has heard some other managed care companies talk about some pockets of elevated cost trends in Medicaid in 2018 that may have lingered a little bit into early 2019. It doesn't seem like Molina is really seeing that basing your results or maybe just perhaps you can comment on your view around this concept of pockets of elevated Medicaid costs versus industry dynamics around Medicaid costs overall? Thanks.
JosephZubretsky: Right, yes. I think the two cost pressures we observed in the quarter were really more related to incidents and events rather than trends in our view. So you take on 30,000 new members in Washington due to a very successful re-procurement and handle a newly carved in behavioral benefit, you're going to get some cost pressure. We believe this will abate in the upcoming months. In Ohio, we did observe a moving of membership off the Medicaid rolls late in 2018 due to a very focused re-eligibility re-determination efforts. And as many suspect and is generally true, it is healthier people that go back to work meaning that you're left with a slightly higher acuity risk pool and we saw some cross pressure there. And as I said before the state of Ohio actuaries have already recognized that this is clearly a phenomenon that needs to be rated. So we believe these cost pressures are temporal. They will be effectively rated and those two businesses do really well for us and our two of our better run health plans.
Operator: The next question will be from Scott Fidel of Stephens. Please go ahead.
ScottFidel: Hi. Thanks. So it looks like CMS maybe trying to breathe some new life into the duals pilots with this recent letter that they sent to the state Medicaid directors. So, Joe, just interested in your thoughts on some of the concepts that CMS discussed in that letter and whether you think this could be a catalyst here for some improved growth momentum around those pilots.
JosephZubretsky: Well, I think two things, Scott. One is CMS has voiced increasing support for the integrated approach, the MMP product whether it's a demonstration or permanent. And with $2 billion of Medicare revenue, $1.4 billion of which is in the MMP demonstrations. We're very well positioned no matter which way they pivot. So the fact that they voiced support for this fully integrated approach is certainly a strategic coupe for us. In terms of some of the rating factors and the way they're going to manage the program whether they are a profit caps, et cetera remains to be seen how all that plays out. Well, we've done very well with the MMP product line. We're absolutely certain that if it expands we'll play there. If they convert it to more of a permanent type of DSNP program, we're well positioned to capture it. And we're just really good at managing these high acuity populations no matter what the wrapper they choose to put it in. And that's what we're focused on right now. So we're following the regulations closely. We've been able to be adaptable and flexible in dealing with every regulation that's been thrown at us in the past. We have a great team and we know we'll be able to implement whatever changes are put to us and we'll manage it very effectively.
ScottFidel: Got it. And then just had a follow-up question. Just going back to that Washington public plan and totally got you in terms that are being tons of different rhetoric and proposals and lot of them don't have meat on the bone, but just had one specific question on that one since in the bill they did talk to sort of the reimbursement levels that would be included in the public plan and talk to a 135% for primary care, first Medicare and then a cap of 160% for hospital and other. Just interested in terms of competitively how that may compare to how reimbursement rates tend to be negotiated in the exchange market. I know that it's around 167% on average for the overall commercial market, but I would assume that given the tighter networks in the exchanges, it's probably more comparable with some of those ranges that were in the Washington Bill, but just interested in your thoughts on that.
JosephZubretsky: Scott, I will claim not to have caught up with the specifics of the Washington Bill. But more generally to the point you're making, we find it rather plausible and realizable that when we are putting together a network for the Marketplace off of our Medicaid network, that negotiating up from a Medicaid rate actually proves to be more cost efficient than a commercial player coming in and negotiating down from a commercial rate, which means that our network plays well, because it's the working poor, but it's also priced right. So I think that's the point you were referring to. We continue to be successful in managing and leveraging our Medicaid network into the Marketplace due to the highly subsidized nature of the population and it's priced right as evidenced by the margins we're achieving and the amount of margin we'll be able to put back into pricing to grow the business again.
Operator: The next question will be from Charles Rhyee of Cowen. Please go ahead.
CharlesRhyee: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on earlier comments, Joe. When you talked about -- I appreciate the comments you said about potential for gains through divestiture is obviously from some of the potential transactions out there, but you also made -- is that what you were talking about in your earlier comments when you were kind of referring to some opportunities for M&A in the future or were you talking more separately about just general opportunities you see to expand traffic areas?
JosephZubretsky: Charles, we were actually referring to both. Certainly, the specific M&A transaction you're referring to, let's wait and see how it unfolds and we'd hope to be invited in and take a serious look at those assets. But more generally speaking, we do have a business development team here, one that I've used in the past. They're very good at what they do. And as we look at new geographies or expanding existing geographies, there are many, as you know, small provider-own plans, by the 1C3 scattered across the United States that dabble in Medicaid. Many of these plans are under-managed, sort of orphaned. They're hard to find, but they can be incredibly valuable if you can absorb someone's membership on top of our cost structure that we've proven to be best-in-class. These can be tremendously [Technical Difficulty]. They're not going to make major headlines, because most of the names are nondescript, but we are looking at plans around the country in existing geographies and to light up new geographies.
CharlesRhyee: Great. Sorry about that. Just a follow-up though. When we think about these kind of opportunities should we think about them as a potential 2019 event or is this really as we think about 2020?
JosephZubretsky: We're looking at opportunities now. And obviously without anything announced in the time to close, I would say that anything we would even action this year is likely not to have benefit for until 2020. As I said, we never do project the benefits from inorganic or pseudo inorganic growth assuming other plans. They're hard to do. It's a bi-party or sometimes a tri-party transaction. They're hard to predict, but we're actively at it and looking for these sometimes value-creating opportunities. We've done it before and the team I have knows how to execute. End of Q&A
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session and will also conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for attending today's presentation. And at this time, you may disconnect your lines.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-12 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Molina Healthcare Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode.

Joseph Zubretsky: Thank you, Ryan, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Last night, we reported earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of $3.01, and $10.61 for the full year ending December 31, 2018. For the full year 2018, we produced pre-tax earnings of $9,99 million and after-tax earnings of $707 million, resulting in pre-tax and after-tax margins of 5.3% and 3.7% respectively on a reported basis. As these results indicate, we have accomplished much over the last year as we executed the first phase of our margin recovery and sustainability plan. The rapid improvement in our operating margin profile has allowed us to shift our focus to driving our profit improvement initiatives for continued margin expansion, while we are quickly pivoting to achieving top-line revenue growth. The quarter itself was very strong with pure performance earnings per share of $3.82 and an after-tax margin of 5.4%. Continuing the momentum, we established early in the year. All-in-all we are very pleased with the results for the quarter. The scope of our prepared remarks today will focus primarily on the margin expansion success we have already achieved and our confidence in sustaining it. However, to be clear, we are equally focused on and have already invested in top-line revenue growth and our very attractive lines of business, Medicaid, Medicare and marketplace as well as our existing and potential new geographies. We plan to showcase this growth plan at our Investor Day in May. Now returning to our financial results, in order to provide the context for our 2019 guidance, it is best to focus much of our commentary on recapping the full year 2018, a year in which we produced pure performance earnings per share of $10.83 far surpassing our initial and revised guidance. This result includes on a consolidated basis, a pure performance MCR of 86.3% and a G&A ratio of 7.1%, both of which enabled a pure performance after-tax margin of 3.8%. Now commenting on 2018 by line of business, the Medicaid business with $13.7 billion in pure performance premium revenue ended the year with an 89.4% pure performance medical care ratio and a pure performance after-tax margin of 2.8% which is within our revised long-term target margin range. Several factors contributed to this result, we were able to skillfully manage medical costs all against a backdrop of a reasonable and rational rate environment and we were successful in executing on a variety of profit improvement initiatives including network contracting, frontline utilization control and retaining increased levels of revenue at risk for quality scores. Our $2.1 billion Medicare business comprising our DSNP and MMP products also delivered favorable results in 2018. Managing to a medical care ratio of 84.5%, we produced an after-tax margin of 4.8%. Specifically, on Medicare, we have proven, we are adapted at managing high acuity members who have complex medical conditions and comorbidities. We have also proven to be proficient at managing approximately $2 billion of long-term services and supports benefits an important and fast-growing benefit across all of our products. And the risk scores of our members continue to improve resulting in increased revenue that is more commensurate with the acuity of our population. Finally, our marketplace business was a significant contributor to this year's favorable results with $1.9 billion in 2018 pure performance premium revenue and exceptional margins. If you recall in 2017 and prior, this business was severely challenged and at that time we set a corrective 2018 pricing action of nearly 60% was warranted. With that as the backdrop, the business produced a pure performance MCR of 65% and then after-tax margin of 11.4% in 2018. Several factors contributed to this result. Our prices in the market although they increased significantly over 2017, we're still very competitive and thus we are able to be retaining membership profile that could be adequately scaled. Many of the core and routine managed care fundamentals are applicable to our other businesses, also helped to produce favorable results in the marketplace business. Our ability to capture and forecast adequate risk scores has improved dramatically and our differentiated strategy of serving the highly subsidized working poor produced the right acuity mix and the right metallic [ph] tier mix, all of which worked well within our pricing parameters. Now commenting on 2018 through the lens of our locally operated health plans, we vastly improved the performance and balance of our health plan portfolio during 2018. Our largest health plans, Ohio, Texas, California, Washington and Michigan continue to perform well and established themselves as worthy of winning re-procurements. The underperforming aspects of our portfolio which we described at the beginning of the year were much improved in 2018. One year ago, we said that 25% of our revenue was in plans that were not profitable. In 2018 all of those plans were profitable. Florida and New Mexico where challenges for obvious reasons but performed admirably as they faced the run-off of large portions of business. In Washington, stage that recovery midway through the year and is now well positioned to return to target margins on its expanded revenue base. In summary, the health plan portfolio is in excellent shape. Now to recap the full year 2018 from the perspective of the operational improvements we implemented and the operating efficiencies we gained. From a pure efficiency perspective, we continue to improve our G&A profile, managing to our ratio of 7.1% for the full year 2018. We've reduced our headcount by more than 800 FTEs or nearly 7% from the beginning of the year. More importantly, we continue to invest in the business, we improved the performance of our core processes, claims, payment integrity, member and provider services and a host of others, all of which create lasting effect. And finally, in 2018, we set the stage for ongoing improvement by making significant progress on a variety of outsourcing initiatives some recently announced which benefit 2019 and beyond. Turning now to addressing the 2018 improvements to our balance sheet and capital structure, our improved operating performance allowed us to dividend approximately $300 million to the parent company. This owed us well for producing excess cash flow in the future. And we deployed approximately $1.2 billion to retire highly volatile and expensive convertible debt and repaid the outstanding amount drawn on our revolving line of credit. This reduced earnings per share volatility and lowered our debt to cap ratio to approximately 47%. In summary for 2018, across all of our product lines, health plans, operating metrics and with respect to capital management, we are very pleased with our 2018 performance. Now I will address our 2019 earnings guidance. We are establishing our initial earnings per share guidance for 2019 in the range of $9.25 to $9.75. As Tom will describe later, this is on the basis of GAAP reporting. The headline for 2019 is continued margin strength and sustainability, despite the previously announced revenue decline, all without the benefit of anticipating any prior year reserve development. On 2019 revenues, overall, we expect premium revenue to come in at approximately $15.8 billion in 2019, a decrease of approximately 10% due to the contract losses in Florida and New Mexico and the membership attrition as a result of the conservative approach we have taken to marketplace pricing. Despite these revenue challenges, we are encouraged by multiple new revenue foundations we laid in 2018 that will carry into 2019 Specifically, within Medicaid, we invested heavily in new business development, winning three RFPs, the largest being Washington, but also Puerto Rico and Mississippi chip. We also submitted what we believe to be a winning proposal in the Texas Star Plus program. The Washington reprocurement award expanded membership in regions where we best hit the competition in the consolidation of health plans and also enabled us to participate in the caravan [ph] of behavioral health services. In Florida, we were able to recapture a third of our Medicaid contract and retain approximately $500 million of revenue positioning us well for Medicare and marketplace expansion. In Illinois and Mississippi, we will benefit from membership gains in 2018 which will achieve full year run rate revenue in 2019 and for the 2020 marketplace price filing in early 2019, we will equally focus on growing membership while maintaining profitability. We are forecasting the continued strength and sustainability of margins in 2019. The following points are relevant to that forecast. First, given the significant operating leverage in the managed care business, a 10% decline in the premium revenue base is difficult to overcome from a margin expansion perspective but we are forecasting being successful in doing so. Second, we have taken a cautious view in forecasting the impact of our profit improvement initiatives in our 2019 guidance, although, we maintain a high degree of confidence that we will capture them. And third, while the 2018 results included significant prior year reserve development as a matter of policy, we do not forecast any prior year reserve development and our guidance although we maintained a consistent reserving policy throughout the year. Taking these points into account, the after-tax margins in each of our lines of business will remain strong in 2019. Medicaid margins remain flat at approximately 2.8%. Medicare margins are up approximately 20 basis points to 5% and marketplace margins are down slightly but still in double-digits at 10.8%. Taken together, we expect a consolidated Medical cost ratio between 86.7% and 87%, a consolidated after-tax margin in the range of 3.7% to 3.9% and net income in the range of $600 million to $630 million. The margin improvement trajectory we've experienced is consistent with both our prior disclosures and the discussion of the profit improvement opportunities we have identified. Recall, in 2018 of the original $500 million projection, we harvested $200 million which is now embedded in our run rate earnings. Earlier this year, we increased our projection of opportunities by $250 million to a total future improvement opportunity of $550 million. Our 2019 guidance includes harvesting over $200 million of the revised profit improvement opportunity which is more than offsetting the slightly negative spread between trends in yield of approximately $80 million. These ongoing profit improvement initiatives help create nearly $2 of earnings per share benefit in our 2019 guidance. Overall, our margin recovery efforts have been successful to-date and our margin sustainability plan is well established. While we will remain focused on further margin improvement throughout 2019, we have simultaneously pivoted to growth, we are carefully evaluating new geographic opportunities as well as the adjacent product and benefit carbon opportunities in our existing geographies. With such a successful year now behind us I would like to take a few moments to acknowledge the people who have made all of this happen. The executive leadership team we have assembled have proven their ability to successfully execute on the first phase of our turnaround plan. And still in confidence that they will likewise be able to execute on the next phase and a special note of gratitude to the 11,000 plus associates on the front lines every day caring for our members and delivering high quality service. In conclusion, we are very `pleased with our 2018 results and the strong foundation we have built. There is still significant opportunity for creating value and we are excited for the future and what awaits us in 2019 and beyond. I look forward to sharing more about our future growth plans and longer-term strategy at our next Investor Day on May 30th in New York City. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for more detail on the financials. Tom?
Thomas Tran: Thank you, Joe and good morning. As described in our earnings release, we report fourth quarter earnings per diluted share of $3.01 and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.07, excluding the amortization of intangible assets. We reported full year 2018 earnings per diluted share of $10.61 and full year 2018 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $10.86, excluding the amortization of intangible assets. First, I will highlight the non-recurring items that occur in the quarter, resulting in fourth quarter pure performance earnings per diluted share of $3.82. It is important to note that these items are included in the fourth quarter GAAP reported numbers that we cited in the earnings release. Specifically, we recorded a $52 million previously-tax loss on the self of our pathway's subsidiary. $8 million of restructuring expenses primarily related to costs associated with our ongoing IT restructuring plan. A $3 million gain as part of the repurchase of the 2020 convertible notes and related and medical option termination. And a $24 million pre-tax expense for a retroactive risk corridor adjustment or a California expansion business, primarily related to the state fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. Next, I would like to make some comments on the fourth quarter earnings beat of over $130 million pre-tax or approximately $1.90 per diluted share on a pure performance basis, relative to the top and about pure performance guidance range. That beat can be attributed primarily to the following four items. First, we had prior period development of approximately $90 million in a quarter, most of which is in for a year development and therefore is accounted for in our pure performance result for the full year. Second, our marketplace product continues to perform exceptionally well. The seasonal increase the medical costs we have historically seen did not materialize in the fourth quarter and member retention was better than expected. Third, administrative costs were lower than expected that spike increase sales and marketing costs associated with open enrollment in Medicare and a marketplace. Lower labor cost was the primary driver of this favorable DNA ratio. And fourth, as a result about improved fourth quarter performance and tax benefits on the loss related to the sale for pathways, the effective tax rate for full year 2018 at 29.2% was lower than we expected would result in a fourth quarter benefit of approximately $20 million. Turning to our balance sheet, cash flow and cash position for the quarter and a full year, our reserve approach is consistent with prior quarters and our opposition remains strong. We continue to have favorable into year reserved development. And as we have stated in the past, we intend to include that same level of conservatism in the quarter end reserve balances. Days and claim payables remained flat sequentially at 53 days. While operating cash flow were strong throughout the year. It was negative in a quarter primarily due to our payment up the health insurer fee, on October 1st. As of December 31, 2018, the company has unrestricted cash and investments of approximately $170 million at the parent company. The reduction to parent cash from the end of the third quarter of 2018 primarily relates to the purchase of the 2020 convertible debt. As of December 31, 2018, our health plans had aggregated statutory capital and surplus of approximately $2.4 billion which represent approximately 400% of risk-based capital. I will now quickly discuss capital actions. We have continued to look for opportunities to delever the balance sheet. Our action in a quarter reduce average diluted share outstanding to $66.6 million at year end from $67.9 million at the end of the third quarter. Finally, while not related to 2018, we recently complete a new $600 million term loan to finance the repurchase conversion and redemptions of our 2020 convertible notes that are currently in the money and eligible for early conversion. This is a temporary facility which allows us to keep our $500 million revolver capacity undrawn. Shifting to 2019 guidance, I will ask some detail to bridge our 2018 performance to our 2019 pure performance guidance of $9.50 per diluted share at the midpoint. First, converting 2018 full year reported result to pure performance. The significant items that we call out in our earnings release added $0.22 to our 2018 reported earnings per diluted share of $10.61 for pure performance earning per share of $10.83 for the full year 2018. Second, prior year development which we do not include in our 2019 guidance positively impact 2018 earnings per share by approximately $1.55 per diluted share Third, we believe that the shrine is overhead and resulting negative operating leverage related to the lost contracts in New Mexico and Florida negatively impacts the earnings trajectory by approximately $0.75 per diluted share. Fourth, the negative spread between trend and yield in Medicaid is projected to impact 2019 by approximately $0.90 per diluted share. And fifth, our projected net profit improvement is forecast to increase full year earnings per diluted share by $1.87 combined we arrive at our guidance midpoint of $9.50. The following points are also important relative to our 2019 guidance. First, 2019 guidance assumes consolidated net margins will remain flat at the midpoint. Specifically, we expect Medicaid to remain flat. Medicare to improve approximately 20 basis points and marketplace to decline slightly but remain in double digits off our 2018 pure performance based which include prior year development. Second, our G&A ratio increased 50 basis points to 7.6% in our 2019 guidance. This increase is primarily driven by the incremental G&A costs incur to realize the profit improvement initiatives that will benefit our medical care ratio and result in an overall net profit improvement and the stranded overhead costs due to revenue loss in New Mexico and Florida. And third, 2019 guidance does not assume any impact from prior year development positive or negative. All things being equal if we have favorable development as we did in 2018 our forecasted result will be higher and conversely if development is unfavorable our forecasted result will be lower. You should note that our reserve methodology has been consistently applied. Finally, in conjunction with our earnings release last night, we include a supplementation presentation with additional detail on our financial results and 2019 guidance. Going forward, we planned to provide this additional detail alongside future earnings release as a way of providing further insight into the business. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. The first question today comes from Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research. Mr. Raskin, please go ahead.
Joshua Raskin: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Wanted to ask a little bit more about the revenue bridge and sort of backing up to the Investor Day, where you guys started with the $15.6 billion of premiums. And I know you've got $500 million back in Florida, you talked about I think Mississippi being about $300 million and then Illinois, Ohio, some other growth et cetera. I guess what are the offsets? It looks like only $200 million higher. So, it sounds like some stuff has add, but I don't know how much of that is asset sales versus the exchanges. And then, I think last quarter, you guys were a little bit more optimistic about potential growth in the marketplace, and so just wanted to hear a little bit I guess within that answer what changed there.
Joseph Zubretsky: Well, Joshua, on the revenue bridge, very clearly Florida and New Mexico were a major component of the decline at $2.2 billion. We also note that if you're looking at total revenue, you always have to adjust where they have of $400 million. And yes, the service businesses that we divested in 2018, NMS and Pathways have $400 million in revenue, which effectively disappears in 2019 guidance. But we did pickup $900 million of organic growth, and you cited all the reasons, Mississippi, Illinois full year run-rate of increased membership calling back to $500 million in Florida certainly helped. Washington as we bested certain competitors in various of the regions, we will have increased Medicaid membership and the behavioral caravan. So all-in-all, $900 million of organic growth embedded and what was a disappointing year of contract losses certainly bode well for our revenue pickup in the future.
Joshua Raskin: Got it, got it. And then just a quick question on the outsourcing you guys announced recently. Could you just walk through a little bit more of the specific functions that were outsourced and maybe how much of that savings is in guidance?
Joseph Zubretsky: The contract we just signed the outsourcing arrangement with Infosys related to our IT infrastructure, datacenters, user services et cetera. So, at the hardware. We think it as the hardware. It will result in rebadging certain employees to Infosys that will result in certain number of position eliminations. But we also have increased the effectiveness of the operation, better up times, better response times and just more effective operations. That agreement has already incepted. There is a 90 to 120-day transition period. So, the outsourcing will actually occur to about until about the middle of the year. And so, the savings in 2019 guidance is modest, but we'll ramp the full run-rate in 2020.
Joshua Raskin: Perfect. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Matthew Porsche [ph] with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you and congratulations. Thank you for all the disclosure. So, can you just help us think about where you would like to get to in terms of a run-rate on the operating cost ratio, if that's even the right way to think about it? I mean I know that there are structural differences depending on how much you grow to the various parts of the business, but I'm just trying to look at your mid-7s guidance for 2019 relative to the low-7s that you achieved in 2018 and then the stranded overhead in the G&A that you're spending to achieve savings.
Joseph Zubretsky: Sure Matt, while we're not giving a forecast for 2020 and beyond. We certainly believe there is more upside to our G&A ratio than downside risk. So you're right about the puts and takes in 2019 painful reminder of how the operating leverage works in this business this 306 cost of the loss contribution margin from the Mexico and Florida put 30 to 40 basis points pressure on that ratio, but more importantly we're investing $90 million to $100 million in lot of G&A to invest in medical cost improvements and other improvements to our core business. I believe in the future we will as we grow we'll get positive operating leverage we'll continue to invest in the business and of course you cited the mix effects that we're likely to get depending on how big the marketplace business in the future so we believe that the G&A ratio as we move for improvement going forward but we're not giving a forecast more room for upside and downside.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Justin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. So, the focus shifts to the top-line growth just hoping you can walk us through any kind of early view of your exchange strategy for 2020 as well as any key RFPs or opportunities for state membership transactions that could fuel revenue growth into next year?
Joseph Zubretsky: Sure, Justin on the exchanges as we said in a public forum just about a month ago, we plan to grow this business. We actually think we can double with size and still have a proportional relationship between our exchange business in our Medicaid business in the states in which we do business. Obviously, that won't come in one year and the interesting thing about this business is as you know the prices are in relation to the competitors, so we've done a very exhaustive pricing elasticity study. We know where our prices are to ridge against the competition, we plan for 2020 to ease up on price we certainly are going to price to 50% pre-tax margins and 10% after-tax margins. But we believe we can grow the business have the MCR move up from the mid-60s to 70% maybe into the low 70s, maintain a high single-digit margin without ever tripping the minimum MOR. So, we're feeling really good about the growth prospects of this business and the ability to grow it, produce a high single-digit margin and have the pool of profits grow overtime.
Justin Lake: Any Medicaid opportunities?
Joseph Zubretsky: Right now, the early lead I can give you on growth for 2020 beyond would be in Medicaid and Medicare. In DSNP, we plan to file a Notice of Intent to play in 170 additional counties in DSNP alone, two states of which would-be brand-new Ohio and South Carolina. With respect to Medicaid there are $30 billion of opportunities coming into the market in our estimation over the next three years, way one Louisiana, Minnesota, Hawaii, Kentucky and possibly Pennsylvania, way two, Tennessee, West Virginia and Indiana. We have a newly developed business development team we vent our key team we're on the ground and many of these geographies are doing a feasibility study, the regulatory environment strength the competitors, our ability to build networks so we're actively at work working on the growth phase of this turnaround.
Justin Lake: Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Ana Gupte with SPV Leerink. Please go ahead.
Ana Gupte: Hey, thanks good morning. Congrats on 2018 a great performance and just wanted to question about what you put out in January which I thought was a very nice logical presentation on your opportunities to grow. But when you kind of look at the Medicaid if you start with Medicaid benchmarking again the commentary and performance you're seeing from near the national competitors doesn't look like it's that easy to expand margins neither unite it or health care or Cetin [ph] have shown great performance on margin expansion there and trends the spread as you see ups and pressure. And while I can look at all of your margin expansion drivers and they're on the expense I mean is there any read across or why does it look like you can do so much better than yourself and other I guess one on the projector?
Joseph Zubretsky: Well, I think Ana, I think the first thing I like to remind folks is that the cost structure that is built into the rating structures is the entire market. And so that, if you can create a cost structure, both your G&A profile and your medical costs profile, that is better than your competitors, you get the lifting rates from the market cost structure. And then you can operate at a more efficient structure and produce best-in-class margins. Now, whether it's sustainable, or now we have to prove that. But to your point about Medicaid, we broke through the 90% barrier on pure performance Medicaid for the year at 89.4. But I would remind everybody that ABD still at 91%, that's $5.5 billion of premium in 2018 alone. So, I do believe there are still is room for modest improvement and our Medicaid line, which obviously is a $13 billion line of business for us.
Ana Gupte: Okay. All right. And then just following up on the earlier question related to marketplaces and margins and growth. It's going to go from low-double to very high-single and this year, you'd see, you're not going into 2019 and margins look like there are a bit under pressure. The overall exchange book is down a bit year-over-year and their policy changes and competitive forces at play. Do you think that will remain a big growth driver, I mean looking at 2019, it seems challenging to me to see that happening?
Joseph Zubretsky: Well, I think, our market niche is very differentiated. We are servicing, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. the working poor 20% of our membership are fully subsidized, another 70% are partially subsidized. We get to leverage our Medicaid network not only the network itself, but the cost structure in the network to give us very, very competitive cost structure. So, look, for 2019. At this time last year, we were compelled nearly to put trend into the market on top of our 2018 rates. We didn't know at this time last year that 2018 would have turned into a 15% pre-tax year. So, we put trend into the market on top of what we're already very rich rates and we're paying for it on the membership line coming into 2019. That is not going to be the phenomenon in 2019 or 2020. We now know exactly where we sit with our membership. We know the acuity. The churn of members is very low. So, 80% of these members we haven't in prior years. So, we're feeling really good about the stability of our book of business, our ability to now put a more reasonable price point in the market to begin growing again.
Ana Gupte: Thanks, Joe for color very helpful.
Joseph Zubretsky: You're welcome.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Fidel [ph] with Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just the first question, just wanted to get a little more detail on the negative spread that you discussed that you're building in for 2019 in Medicaid, and maybe just can you call out which markets in particular where you're seeing rate cost bright upside down? Is it just a few markets or are you seeing that more widespread?
Thomas Tran: Well Scott, we don't really like to talk about rates and the strength of rates in individual markets. But I would tell you that it's marginal across all markets, 20 basis points here, 50 basis points there. You're always having debates about trend components. How is pharmacy trending? Sometimes when benefits are carved-in and carved-out. How much premium is a state taking away on a carved-out benefit and how much premium are they putting on our carved-in benefit. So. I would just say all-in-all these are the normal puts and takes of the rating environment. And right now, at about 100 basis points of negative spread this year, it's very stable and very rational and will always have profit improvement initiatives, always have an inventory of profit improve initiatives of 150 to 200 basis points of premium. That is the way you need to run this business. To make sure that in a year where we're presented with a negative spread, we can offset it and keep our margins whole.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, and then just head just one follow-up. Just interested in and what you can update us at this point, just around some of the recent headlines coming out of Ohio on them discussing potentially rebidding the Medicaid contract and just given some of the even sort of above average scrutiny of the PBM servicing the Medicaid plants in that market.
Thomas Tran: Sure. We were fully expecting Ohio to reprocure, to drop an RFP perhaps late in 2019, for an effective date in 2020. So, we're fully prepared for that. The new administration, always when near to change administration, you never know what the new plan would be. The new administration in Ohio does seem to be prepared for reprocuring the Medicaid program. So, we're fully prepared to deal with that and given the scope of our business, our market share, in the way we perform, we're extremely confident of prevailing and perhaps even growing in that reprocurement. With respect to PBM and pharmacy, yeah Ohio has been particularly scrutinizing the pharmacy industry. Look, the pharmacy trends where they are, they are putting pressure on cost and everybody knows that. I would say this, we have enough flexibility in our contract with CBS care mark that if whatever Ohio decides they want for a pharmacy benefit carved in, carved out, separate PBM, carved in PBM, we would be able to deal with it and put a proposal that would satisfy their requirements both in medical and for PBM.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Windley: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Joe you mentioned that the Infosys contract, it sounds like will ramp through the balance of the first half of this year and not generate a lot of savings for 2019, I wondered if you could put a ballpark number on what you expect the total savings to be overtime and is that part of the remaining kind of overall cost savings bogey that you have laid out recently or is that somehow separate from that? thanks.
Thomas Tran: David, this is Tom. We're not going to disclose specific cost saving with the Infosys contract, but it will be fair to say that it's quite significant compare to our current base of operating - our current base of expenses. And that it's really a multi-year contract, so you should expect to see that to be lasting over a number of years. And it is embedded in the $550 million of saving that we have put out at the last JPM conference.
David Windley: Okay, thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Steve Tanal, with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Stephen Tanal: Good morning, guys. Just two questions for me. I think on the first one, just thinking about some of the thought processes around Tax Reform and Medicaid rates last year, I think it all suggested that Tax Reform benefits would find their way back to Medicaid rates. But, just wanted to get your updated thoughts on that, are you seeing any actions from the states in that front is that maybe part of the related to the trend discussion or how are you all thinking about that now?
Joseph Zubretsky: No, the discussion about the tax regime really enters into rate discussions. Just had most of discussions are around debates about different cost components how they are trending, and the rate take up or take out for benefit carve in and carve out, but very really if ever is there a discussion specifically about taxes.
Stephen Tanal: Great, okay. So broad and more sustainable now and I guess just the other one that I had was wondering if you could give us a little more specificity on sort of the savings that are baked into 2019 versus 2020, so in the slides for the call looks like you're stating there was a portion of the $550 million of remaining profit improvement opportunity, if you can maybe size what you expect to sort of book in 2019 in the context of the guide and maybe give us some clarity on what you expect to drive your sort of annual G&A run rate down by about that amount sort of exiting 2019 into 2020.
Joseph Zubretsky: Sure, if you look at the $1.87 of earnings per share, we put in the guidance bridge. Just as pull that a part. It's about a $150 million pre-tax. That number is $250 million of gross profit improvements offset by $90 million to a $100 million of hard G&A cost to produce them. And the first thing I would say is we were very exact by including all of the cost to produce those benefits but very cautious in forecasting the benefits that will actually emerge in the P&L. So that $150 million of net profit improvement is $250 million of gross profit improvement offset by a $100 million of the hard cost to produce them. We still consider that conservative and that will build into the run rate that we'll project forward into 2020.
Stephen Tanal: Perfect. Great. Thanks for all the clarity.
Joseph Zubretsky: You're welcome.
Operator: The next question comes from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Sarah James: Thank you. So great guidance for 2019 obviously a very impressive margin profile. Can you Help us understand or breakout parts of that maybe unsustainable, help us understand what part of that is in different products or various lines? Thank you.
Joseph Zubretsky: Sarah, as we look at the margin guidance. So, let's to keep it simple, after-tax margin is probably the easier metric to look at, so we're not adjusting for all the puts and takes that hits some things like that. We are maintaining a 3.8% after-tax margin consolidated in an environment where revenues are declining by 10% and in environment where the 2018 margins included $137 million pre-tax were $1.55 of favorable development. So, the question of sustainability is an interesting one, but to maintain that level of margin in that environment particularly compared to 2018 we think is a really good solid forecast to project forward. 2.8% Medicaid, 5% in Medicare and still double digit in marketplace is a very attractive margin profile and really and, in this environment, we think that's a very good start to the year.
Sarah James: Second, just to clarify so if we take those segment margin profiles that you talked about in the 3.8 in 2019. Are you seeing that this is sustainable net margin profile for the company? So, I'm thinking back to either there was the 2.3 to 2.7 laid off for 2020. But as you move through some of the cost savings initiatives, is this where the company looks like it's going to be going forward?
Joseph Zubretsky: We think high-twos for Medicaid is certainly sustainable. We think that a mid-single digit for Medicare is certainly sustainable. And as we described previously, we believe that as we grow our marketplace business the margin will drop from low double digit to high-single digit. Conscious effort to move the MCR up from the mid-60s to 70 or even low-70s not trip the minimum MLR and grow the profit pool rather than focusing just on the percentage margin.
Sarah James: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Kevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. So, related to that exchange comment. Is that transition to that new margin profile expected to happen in 2020 or just like a multi-year move for you?
Joseph Zubretsky: It's an analysis of the elasticity, the pricing elasticity of the product. And how much growth you think you can put on the books for the level of margin that you're willing to give up to do it. And it's market-by-market geography by geography. We know where our competitors fit, we certainly know their strategy for the metallic tiers. They know ours as well. but with our new marketplace management team, and now that we have a book of business that is 80% repeating, we think we have a very, very good visibility on our marketplace business to grow it at high-single digit rates and never trip the minimum MRR. So it's all the question of how fast we want to grow. It is a multi-year effort. You never like to grow any book of business too quickly. So, it's probably a multi-year effort.
Kevin Fischbeck: Okay. And then you've mentioned that I guess you still have $350 million of cost savings out of the 550 beyond 2019. How should we think about the ramp of and kind of the rest of those savings for the next few years?
Joseph Zubretsky: Well, we're just now getting by the point where we've planned for 2019. We'll probably give the market by view of that at our Investor Day in May which will also give glimpse of the 2020 growth rate as well. So, if we could wait another month or so couple of months until May try to give you a forward look of how the profit improvement will emerge over the next couple of years and also how the top-line will grow in the next couple of years. But it's there, we certainly we put it out there for public disclosure so we certainly understand it, we have models that I don't want to say prove it but strongly suggested that it's real and tangible and actionable and they can offset a wide of rate erosion in the marketplace and also help sustain our margins.
Kevin Fischbeck: And I guess you probably I think you just said that you don't want to answer this question and wait as well but you mentioned kind of two ways of Medicaid RFPs over the next few years that you worry talk a little bit just about exchange membership and then expanding Medicare into next year. Do you think that you're going to actually grow better in 2020 than your top-line that you did in 2019 excluding the contract losses if you can just kind of put those aside? Is 2020 going to be a year showing that growth or is 2020 still you got so many things investing and it's really 2021, before the top-line grow?
Joseph Zubretsky: I think just to give us the next few months, we're in the middle of our three-year strategic planning process, which is culminating in mid-April shared with our Board in May and showing to marketplace in late May. So, you can just indulge us and wait to that point in time, we'll give you a good view of 2020 at that time.
Kevin Fischbeck: All right. Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Zac Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Zachary Sopcak: Thanks. Good morning and congrats on a great 2018. Want to ask about the $1.35 higher developments just I'm clear it sounds like your reserving methodology is similar for 2019 is there anything in that $1.35 we should think about unusual as we think about 2019 might progress?
Joseph Zubretsky: I wouldn't say there is anything unusual from a sense that our reserve methodology has been very consistently applied quarters-over-quarters. And so, we saw that development coming out and we have the same approach going through 2019. So, we're not predicting any favorable and unfavorable development, but certainly if you follow that methodology then you can draw your own conclusion. What we also see in the first quarter so far is that flu effect has been somewhat attain a low comparing to prior year so that certainly can be a positive sign for potentially a mind seasonal effect of a seasonal high medical cost that you see in winter.
Zachary Sopcak: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And that leads to my second question on seasonality so you seem in 2018 kind of buck traditional seasonality probably given you have a lot of different things going on what's profit improvement opportunities, is there any way you can help us think about seasonality for 2019 given you're also reharvesting additional opportunities or any other way to think about the kind of progression throughout the year?
Joseph Zubretsky: Medicare and Medicaid books are pretty evenly distributed from a seasonality perspective. Marketplace is generally backend loaded as to medical cost but last year in 2018, it wasn't. we think we had more chronic members that doesn't mean they were necessarily bad members, but they were just chronic members that were utilizing services throughout the year. So, I think this year you'll see a pretty even seasonality pattern, marketplace could be a little bit back loaded but Medicare and Medicaid could be pretty evenly distributed.
Zachary Sopcak: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Gary Taylor with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Gary Taylor: Hi. Good morning. Two-part question; one, you provided GAAP guidance without in relation of intangibles which I think was roughly $0.30 last year I know a little bit of that goes away with the clockwise deals so if you have an update or estimate for 2019?
Thomas Tran: We disclosed that in a table in our earnings release the amortization and intangible for 2018. For 2019 you're right it's going to be lower and we estimate it to be in our neighborhood of about $0.20 EPS.
Gary Taylor: Thank you. And the second part of my question, can you help us understand a little bit so the exchange enrollment down for 2019. You talked about that the effect of your pricing essentially. Can you talk about Florida a little bit, and what is the impact on your cost structure in Florida and your big strategy in Florida and maybe could you just talk about enrollment and changes in Florida? But does the impact happen - you are all from portion of the state, from the Medicaid perspective have an impact on the Florida exchange enrollment?
Thomas Tran: Yeah. So Florida, I would say the Medicaid contract that we have lost in certain region. The space started transition in the fourth quarter late fourth quarter. So, when you look at membership that we disclosed in the table in the earnings release, you would see that 10-F membership declined quarter-over-quarter. And the big chunk of that is really from the Florida market decline as membership transitioned to duration that we will exit. From a view point of impact on a change, the two really doesn't have that much effect, there is not really related. In fact, we do see membership growth for the hit's membership in the State of Florida.
Gary Taylor: Okay. So, which states would have been the largely exchanged declined for 2019?
Thomas Tran: The larger membership we have in that, if the exchange is really in the State of Texas. So, we do see decline in State of Texas from 2018 into 2019. So, the fluctuation in many different spaces some gains some loss, but certainly Texas has a major impact on the decline from 2018 into 2019.
Gary Taylor: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Steve Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Steven Valiquette: Thanks, and good morning, everybody. So, Joe, I don't want to beat the exchange topic to depth here. But just coming back to your investor presentation from last month and again that slide that shows Malina marketplace growth scenarios where you talk about the marketplace raise for Malina growing to either $2.6 billion or $3.6 billion. You touched on the margin component of that slide already. But again, just for the revenue side just want to clarify whether those revenue numbers were intended to be actual targets for Malina. And what the timeframe is if there is one, or again was the revenue portion of that slide more just for illustrative purposes. Thanks.
Joseph Zubretsky: It was for illustrative purposes. And to be very clear, we're not giving a specific outlook or forecast until our Investor Day in May. But it was really to make the point that if we were to return the business to its original size which was $4 billion. Knowing what we know about our pricing competitiveness, knowing what we know about administrative cost leverage, can we produce high-single digit margins and grow the business back with original state. So, it was less illustrative. We do believe it's doable over some period of time, and how that manifests itself in our ongoing forecast will be showcased at our Investor Day in May.
Steven Valiquette: Okay got it. Okay, thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Newshel with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Michael Newshel: Thanks. I know you touched on some specific dates, but can you just break down the exchange loan results for the year, between the same market declines versus gains you saw in new markets.
Thomas Tran: We're not going to go into specifics dates by state here. But Michael and I mentioned before is that Texas which were roughly about 55% to 60% of our membership in 2018. We did see decline there, so that's where really the main driver of the membership decline from 2018 into 2019. As you know we have reentered into some new space, the former states that we exited Utah and Wisconsin. We did see some level of membership there. Nothing significant, but the remaining market there are fluctuations up and down. Some we gain, some we lose. I mentioned in fourth quarter we gained some membership. Some market we fairly stable for example state of California fairly stable. So overall, there is a decline definitely from 360 at the end of 2018 into January right now, we are somewhere around 325 to 330.
Michael Newshel: Okay. How about, can you signal the impact of the investments that are in the bridge from 2018 to 2019? I think you said pathways and move is a loss, but MMS may have been a slight contributor is the net impact material at all there?
Thomas Tran: I would say that about $0.10.
Michael Newshel: I'm sorry, was that, it's about a $0.10 headwind the divestment?
Thomas Tran: 2018.
Michael Newshel: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Peter Costa: Hi, guys. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Really want to talk to a bigger picture about what's going on with RFPs in Medicaid in general. You saw the North Carolina quality scores that came out and you've seen other recent scores that have come out. Have you seen anything that has given you more positive or less positive views on your Texas bid? And in particular, beyond that, do you think there's something that you guys are missing or that you need to have to acquire to look better for some of these are RFPs that seem to be favoring more population health and things like that?
Michael Newshel: So, Peter, we're still very optimistic based on everything we know about our RFP bid on Star Plus in Texas. No news is emerged that makes us any more or less competent. We've always been very, very confident in the outcome. We think our strategy and building capabilities internally and our rent to own strategy is the right balance. We really don't believe you need to acquire the equity of a company in order to import an integrated capability. And you've seen us announced a major partnership with some world class partners and you'll see more of that on esoteric and niche capabilities that we think couldn't possibly be scaled adequately or capably in order to deliver into our operating platforms for delivery into a service model. So, we're building capabilities internally on core capabilities. We're looking for co-sourcing partners and a rent to own strategy for esoteric capabilities and as long as they're fully integrated. We believe our products can win in the marketplace and continue to win RFPs. We have no reason to believe that they can't.
Peter Costa: Okay. So, we shouldn't expect any further acquisitions regarding especially capabilities or anything like that?
Joseph Zubretsky: So, any front I'd always welcome an opportunity to look for a bolt-on membership opportunity and a current state where we get some good operating leverage. But no, not spending capital on EBITDA multiples for capability place.
Peter Costa: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Last question today is a follow-up from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Mr. Lake please go ahead.
Justin Lake: Thanks, good morning. So, thanks for the extra question. Just wanted to ask a numbers question on investment income, it looked like you guys guiding to about $195 million. I think there might be other stuff in there besides investment income, but big step up and that number, so, just wanted to get some clarity on that. Thanks.
Thomas Tran: Justin, the $70 million increase in investment and other revenue is due to two things. One is that higher investment income, I would say that roughly about 40% of that change and the rest is really the full year effect of the ASO fee for the pharmacy benefit or carve out in a state of Washington whereby work pay when they saw see the manage that program for the state. So, the last year it was only a half year and 2019 is really a full year. So, hope that clarifies the change there.
Justin Lake: Thanks for the color.
Thomas Tran: You're welcome.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and also concludes our conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky.
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Ryan, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Last night, we reported third quarter earnings of $2.90 per diluted share and $7.60 per diluted share for the nine months ending September 30, 2018. For the quarter, net non-run rate charges were $30 million or $0.35 per diluted share. These charges resulted primarily from a mandated retroactive adjustment for a minimum loss ratio floor and risk corridor on the 2016 California Medicaid Expansion business, partially offset by the gain on the sale of MMS. This adjustment is described in our earnings release. For the nine months ending September 30, 2018, net non-run rate benefits were $54 million or $0.59 per diluted share. Therefore, from a pure performance perspective, after considering these non-run rate items, we achieved fully diluted earnings per share of $3.25 for the third quarter and $7.01 for the nine months ending September 30, 2018. I also note that the quarter included $0.34 in tax benefits, mainly to adjust our year-to-date effective tax rate to a lower projected tax rate in recognition of our improved outlook for full year earnings. The nine month results however fully reflect our projected full year tax rate. We are very pleased with the continued improvement in the performance of our business, and our financial results reflect the significant progress we are making in executing our margin recovery and sustainability plan. Now, for a deeper look into the underlying operating leverage and metrics: First, with respect to revenues, premium revenue decreased by approximately 4% from the second quarter of 2018, and approximately 2.7% after removing the impact of the retroactive California risk corridor adjustment. The decrease is largely attributable to the expected seasonal decline in Marketplace membership, the Washington Medicaid pharmacy carve-out effective July 1, and the effective rate changes for July 1. Our Medicaid and Medicare volumes remained strong. Second, with respect to our control of medical costs and the resulting medical care ratio, we continue to produce sequential MCR improvement. Our pure performance medical care ratio excluding the retroactive California risk corridor adjustment was 86.4% in the third quarter, a 60 basis point improvement over the second quarter MCR of 87% on a pure performance basis after adjusting for the benefit of the 2017 Marketplace risk adjustment and cost-sharing reduction. Medical costs across all the health plans and product lines were largely stable, and in many places improved when compared to prior quarters. Our medical cost baseline continues to develop favorably, and we have managed cost trend to below our forecasted trend rate. Now that we have credible nine-month data with good visibility into the underlying medical economics, we can attribute the improvement to many of the early actions the company has taken to improve its performance. Most notably, we have re-contracted high-cost providers in our networks. We have added additional resources to frontline utilization management and improved execution of utilization controls and care management protocols. This has resulted in lower rates of hospital admissions, ER visits and short in-patient stays, as well as reduced lengths of stay for hospital admissions. We have improved claim payment integrity processes by enhancing our software platforms to ensure we pay for services appropriately, reducing errors and duplicate claims and executing better on coordination of benefit recoveries, and we have achieved better performance in retaining at-risk revenue by improved risk borrowing (06:50) and quality measurement. All-in-all, we have enhanced our ability to manage and forecast medical costs, all while ensuring our members receive the high-quality service they deserve at the right time, at the right price, and in the right setting. I turn now to our control of administrative costs. We have continued to improve our administrative cost structure and to lower our G&A ratio through a number of our ongoing initiatives. We have reduced our administrative expense sequentially in each of the last three quarters through the following actions: First, we have managed our head count to align with activity and transaction volumes. Since the beginning of the year, we have reduced our head count by more than 600 positions, or over 5% of our workforce. Second, we have continued to streamline our management ranks and managed bands (07:43) of control. Third, we have eliminated spending on certain IT projects that in our view were not creating value. Fourth, we continue to steadily reduce our excess real estate capacity. And fifth, we have negotiated lower unit costs in many of our labor and non-labor contracts. We will continue to scrutinize all aspects of our administrative cost structure. However, we anticipate that administrative expense in the fourth quarter will increase due to the seasonality of some marketing programs and the commencement of many of our transformation initiatives that will produce benefits in 2019 and beyond. We also made significant progress in the quarter related to our capital structure and free cash flow to the parent. In the quarter, we continued to deleverage and reduce the share count volatility associated with our convertible notes. We closed on the sale of MMS, delivering approximately $230 million of cash to the parent, and we recently announced the sale of Pathways, a non-core asset for a nominal purchase price. The transaction closed in October, and we estimate that we will record a loss on the sale of approximately $0.60 per diluted share in the fourth quarter. Our capital structure is stable, cash flows to the parent entity are strong, and our credit metrics are sound. This positions us well for beginning the conversation about a potential credit rating upgrade which could lower our future cost of debt. I turn now to the performance of our product lines. Our Medicaid product performed well compared to the second quarter. On a pure performance basis, our Medicaid MCR was 89% compared to 89.8% in the second quarter. Our ABD and Expansion products drove the improvement, while we experienced slightly higher medical costs in our TANF product which still has much room for improvement. Medicare generally performed in line with our expectations, but deteriorated sequentially with a combined medical care ratio of 87.3% compared to 85% in the second quarter. On a nine-month basis, the total medical care ratio is in line with our expectations at 85.7%. The sequentially elevated MCR was in the integrated MMP plans, and largely attributable to certain revenue transfers between the Medicare and Medicaid lines of business, which had no impact on our consolidated result. Our DSNP product continues to perform very well and serving the dual-eligible population is a key area for our future growth. Both our MMP and DSNP products benefited from our improved collection of risk score data and our ability to retain quality withholds. Our Marketplace business has continued to perform well, achieving a pure performance medical care ratio of 65.3% compared to 68.4% in the second quarter after removing the impact of the non-run rate items. This 310 basis point improvement was driven by lower medical costs and higher revenue from better risk score performance and better-than-expected membership retention. We have not yet observed the seasonal in-year utilization increase we experienced in prior years. Marketplace is now performing at an after-tax margin of approximately 9% to 10% for the full year, well ahead of our pricing expectation while only triggering the minimum MLR in one market. The pricing actions that we took in 2018 increased our average rates by nearly 60%. Based on our performance year-to-date, we are pleased at how well our forecast of expected cost trends and membership mix aligned with the rate increases we delivered. I turn now to the performance of our local health plan. The majority of our health plans have continued to perform well, as a result of our new operating model, which mandates local execution and decision-making with stringent enterprise oversight and performance management. Michigan, Texas and Washington continued to perform well across most lines of business. Michigan saw improvement from slightly higher premium revenue and continued in-patient cost improvement, as the health plan is focused on reducing short-term in-patient stays. Texas with more than 50% of our Marketplace revenue, improved sequentially. While much of the improvement was due to lower medical costs and improved revenue retention in Marketplace, the Medicaid and Medicare lines of business combined also performed slightly better than expected. We remain positive on our prospects with the reprocurement of the STAR and the STAR+PLUS contracts. Washington has continued to reduce the in-patient cost pressures in the Medicaid product that were identified earlier in the year to a more intense utilization management approach. Also, as you will recall, Washington carved out the Medicaid pharmacy benefit in the third quarter and our results now reflect the corresponding premium and medical cost declines associated with that carve-out. In the quarter, we also made significant progress on many future value-creating initiatives. Most notably, our Mississippi Health Plan went live on October 1 as a new entrant into a market with two existing health plans. As a start-up plan, we will receive all of the auto assignment membership until our health plan reaches 20% of the total membership in the program. We currently expect to end the year with approximately 20,000 members and the projection for 2019 could be as high as 90,000 members by the end of the year. Our new island-wide contract in Puerto Rico is expected to go live with approximately 290,000 members, a slight decline from our prior two region membership roles, but with significant potential for additional membership. We remain confident that we will be able to earn and sustain a return in excess of our cost of capital. And finally, the court has not yet issued a ruling on our protest in New Mexico. Pending the court's decision, we are managing the run-off of the New Mexico Medicaid plan and transitioning the membership. We will remain in the Marketplace and Medicare business in New Mexico in 2019. I turn now to our revised guidance. Our revised GAAP guidance for the year is $8.80 to $9.00 earnings per diluted share, or an increase of $1.65 at the midpoint from our previous guidance. On a pure performance basis, our revised guidance is a $2.60 per share increase. Our GAAP guidance and our pure performance guidance are expected to be nearly identical, as the non-run rate benefit for the first nine months will be offset by the loss on the sale of the Pathways business. Tom will elaborate on guidance in a few minutes. Assuming the achievement of our full year guidance, we step back and look at our businesses for the full year 2018 through the lens of our margin recovery plan. Our Medicaid business is a solid franchise, has a diversified footprint, great product depth and with an after-tax margin between 2% and 2.5% is now performing very well, although there is still significant room for improvement. Our Medicare business with annual revenue of approximately $2 billion is favorably positioned in the duals market and is performing well having now achieved after-tax margins between 3% and 3.5%. And our Marketplace business, after years of corrective pricing actions and instability, is not only stable, but is now producing after-tax margins of 9% to 10%. Measured off of any starting point we could choose, Marketplace is a significant part of this overall margin recovery story. On a consolidated basis, we expect to achieve an after-tax margin of 3.2%, which, for the first year of this turnaround, is a result we are very pleased with. I will close with some preliminary thoughts on 2019 as we head into the fourth quarter. While it is too early to provide detail on 2019 earnings, I can provide the following observations as we see them today. At the midpoint of $8.90 pure performance guidance EPS for 2018, we have a very solid earnings baseline, and within a range margins that are sustainable and have less potential for volatility. In short, the quality of earnings in 2018 is high. Against this backdrop of a solid 2018 earnings baseline, we are currently in the process of developing our 2019 financial plan and evaluating all of the factors that will impact our 2019 earnings trajectory, including the continuation of the positive momentum we have in managing medical cost trend, the continued adequacy of our Medicaid rates, the competitiveness of our Medicare and Marketplace rates once our competitors rates are known, how much of the significant profit improvement plans we previously communicated will manifest in 2019 earnings, and while we are effectively managing the total and partial runoff of the New Mexico and Florida Medicaid contracts, the potential for some level of stranded fixed cost still exists. Over the long term, management is committed to increasing both operating earnings and earnings per diluted share above the levels of our 2018 full year guidance. We are currently developing our 2019 financial plan. This plan will fully consider the solid 2018 earnings baseline and these other factors, all of which will determine the 2019 earnings trajectory. We look forward to reporting that outlook to you in February when we announce fourth quarter earnings. We are very pleased with our results to-date. We remain committed to executing the fundamentals of managed care and ensuring that our operating and financial platforms can produce sustainable results. When this is done, we will turn our focus to positioning the company for the inherent growth in this very attractive government managed care sector. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for more detail on the financials.
Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Joe, and good morning. As described in our earnings release, we report third quarter's earnings per diluted share of $2.90 and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.97 excluding the amortization of intangible assets. These strong results were driven by the continue improvement of our day-to-day operational processes that affect medical costs and administrative expenses, favorable cost trends across most of our products, as well as our ongoing margin recovery initiatives. First, let me quickly highlight a few of the items that we call out in our earnings release, particularly as it relates to the $0.35 earning per diluted share of out-of-period non-run rate items. Regarding California, the state imposed a retroactive risk corridor for the state fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, which we noted last quarter as a potential exposure. The state formally present their contract amendment this quarter, which we then agreed to. As a result, we record in the quarter a $57 million pre-tax charge or $0.65 per diluted share. This charge has little impact on how we view the profitability of our California Medicaid business going forward. Excluding this charge, the California Medicaid Expansion product operated within an acceptable medical care ratio in the quarter. We recorded a $5 million benefit in the quarter for Marketplace cost-sharing reduction or CSR subsidies for 2017 days of service. This benefit relates to the reprocessing of claims data for CSR-eligible members and allow us to reduce our liability with CMS. We recorded a $37 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our MMS subsidiary, which we sold for approximately $230 million. We recorded $5 million of restructuring costs in the quarter primarily related to two items: the ongoing true-up of our initial lease abatement estimates, as we continue to rationalize our office space; and cost associated with our 2018 IT restructuring plan that is focused on improving our IT operations with outsourcing and/or co-sourcing various aspects of the technology function, which will provide significant future cost savings. Finally, as part of the repurchase of the 2020 convertible notes and related embedded call option termination, we incur approximately $10 million of expenses. These costs primarily related to the acceleration of the remaining discount amortization on those notes, as we continue to simplify our capital structure. Regarding our tax position, our full year effective tax rate improved to a range of 32% to 33% from 35% to 36% per our previous guidance due to improved earnings for the year, as our marginal tax rate is approximately 22%. This improvement result in a third quarter benefit of $0.34 earnings per diluted share. However, for the nine month ending result fully reflect our expected annual tax rate, so our nine-month result need not be adjusted for tax items. I will now spend a few minutes discussing our reserve position. Our reserve approach is consistent with prior quarters, and our position remains strong. The favorable development we experienced in 2018 from 2017 has increased slightly to approximately $230 million, including the explicit margin that we hold. We continue to have favorable intra-year reserve development and as we have stated in the past, we intended to include the same level of conservatism in the quarter and reserve balances. Days in claims payable are up approximately 4 days sequentially. Approximately 2 days of the increase are attributable to the expansion of the quality review process for claims payment, which involves certain extra review steps prior to finalizing payment. The remaining 2 days are due to normal fluctuations in the reserve balance. Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow, we have continue to look for strategic opportunities to delever the balance sheet as we outlined during Investor Day, and our capital actions year-to-date have result in a benefit of approximately $0.30 earnings per diluted share for the year. As of September 30, 2018, the company had unrestricted cash and investments of approximately $390 million at the parent company. We continue to be more capital efficient at the health plan level, ensuring a more consistent and regular dividend flow to the parent company. At the end of the third quarter, our health plans had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately $2.1 billion, which represent more than 350% of risk-based capital. Our operating cash flows are strong. However, operating cash flows was negative in the quarter, primarily due to our payment of the Marketplace risk transfer for fiscal year 2017. Let me offer some additional thoughts on our revised guidance. We have raised our full year guidance to a range of $8.80 to $9.00 per diluted share, an increase of $1.65 on a GAAP basis and an increase of $2.60 on a pure performance basis at the midpoint from our previous guidance issue on August 1. This increase is comprised of the following: First, our medical cost baseline continues to develop favorably, and we have managed cost trend to below our forecast trend rate. Second, we project that our Marketplace product will perform better than we previously projected due to better revenue retention and lower medical costs. And third, we expect that performance of our Medicaid product will remain steady in the fourth quarter. Now, to bridge our result in the first nine months of the year to our revised guidance in the fourth quarter; our pure performance earning per diluted share was $7.01 for the nine months ending September 30, 2018. We estimated that our fourth quarter earnings per diluted share at the midpoint of approximately $1.90. On a sequential basis, our fourth quarter earnings per diluted share is projected to be lower than our third quarter's earnings, primarily due to three reason: First, the expected Marketplace seasonal decline in membership and increase in medical costs. Second, the catch-up benefit from the lower effective tax rate in the third quarter will not repeat in the fourth quarter. And third, an increase in our general and administrative expense ratio for the fourth quarter, which is projected to be at 8%. This increase is due to seasonal spending, including sales and marketing initiatives related to the open enrollment period for Marketplace and Medicare, expenses related to certain IT projects that were delayed from the third quarter into the fourth, and expenses relate to certain transformation initiative that began in the third and fourth quarters which will contribute to 2019 earnings and beyond. Finally, let me offer a few additional points of consideration relating to our revised guidance. Our guidance assumes no prior-period development, and our guidance was developed based on GAAP rather than adjusted earnings per diluted share, which would exclude the amortization of intangible asset. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: Thanks. Good morning. Joe, thanks for the 2019 outlook. Maybe you can give us a little more color there in terms of just starting with the 2018 numbers. Can you talk about what you think a reasonable jump-off point for 2018 is versus the $8.80 to $9.00? Are there areas where you don't think the margins are sustainable, like potentially the 9% to 10% in the individual business?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure, Justin. When you cut through all the puts and takes of the quarter, it's a solid $3-quarter and a very solid $9-year, our guidance at $8.90 at the midpoint. The quality of earnings in 2018 is very strong, and we think that's a great jumping-off point for planning our trajectory into 2019. I cited the various factors that one always takes into consideration when forming a plan: the continued strength of our Medicaid rates; the competitive positioning of our Medicare and our Marketplace rates, can we continue to manage our medical cost baseline and trend as effectively as we have this year. And then certainly, the $500 million of profit improvement initiatives we outlined for you at Investor Day certainly some of that has inured to the benefit of 2018, but most of that is still yet to be harvested. So, the 2018 baseline is a great jumping-off point. I think we've outlined the puts and takes that are endemic to the industry and those specific to Molina. And over the long term, we are committed to growing earnings per share and our pre-tax earnings off of the 2018 solid baseline.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: That's helpful. And then just a follow-up there, maybe another way to come out of this is just net income margins. Clearly, relative to peers, they're now towards the higher end of the range. To grow off here with a shrinking – with a topline that – looks like it's going to be down next year given the membership losses before accelerating in 2020, where do you think the margins on a net income basis can kind of sustain relative to what you've kind of put out there at the Investor Day given you're already there?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: We've challenged the operating team to aspire to be the best margin producers in our space. We're going to produce Medicaid margins just under 2.5% this year after tax, Medicare margins at nearly 3.5%, and Marketplace at nearly 9%, averaging to the 3.2% after-tax margin in our guidance. Clearly, the Marketplace has outperformed our expectation this year, without question. We managed it effectively. We've put 58 points of rate into the market last year. But this year, we only put low-single digit rate increases into the market because our rate actions no longer needed to be corrective. And so I think the question on the Marketplace isn't whether we can sustain the margins, is can we continue to hold on to the membership at the margin we produced this year. But it's a solid product, it's performing well. And we're just now learning how our prices are comparing to our competitors, and we'll have a better outlook for you when we report our fourth quarter.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC: Hi, thanks. I guess similar sort of line of questioning around margin sustainability. And I guess the first thing is, I think you mentioned, Joe, long term you guys want to keep I think 2018 levels of profitability, and so – or I'm sorry, levels of earnings. And so should we think about on a lower top line this 2019 – does that mean 2019 steps back and then longer term we get back to the $9.00, or is that not what you were saying? And then the second question just in terms of the sustainability looking at the G&A side, you guys are running at about a 7% ratio. And so, I'm just curious, is that a sustainable number in light of the fact that you're going to be trying to reinvigorate the growth engine? I look at things like $24 million of CapEx through the first nine months, and it just feels like that can't be sustainable if you're really trying to grow the business. So, maybe just help with the couple of those questions. Thanks.
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. With respect to 2019 revenue, at our Investor Day, we laid out an outlook which suggested that the 2019 premium revenue will be about $15.6 billion. At that time, of course, we were accounting for the total loss of Florida and the total loss of the New Mexico Medicaid contracts. We've since recovered two regions in Florida $0.5 billion. And the Mississippi implementation will be an incremental $300 million to 2019. There are other growth opportunities in our existing portfolio. Our Marketplace business should grow next year with rates now filed in Utah and Wisconsin. As you know, we are very successful in our Washington reprocurement where we have fewer competitors and many other regions we won, and so our membership will grow. Ohio carved in the behavioral benefit halfway through this year, we'll get a full year of that next year. And we picked up 70,000 members mid-year in Illinois, and we'll get a full year effect of that in 2019. So, all-in-all, I think the premium revenue picture, without giving you a specific forecast, is a lot better than what we outlined at Investor Day. Your second question was about G&A, there is more G&A to harvest here. We've redeployed a lot of that G&A to the frontlines. Our net 600 head count reduction was net of resources we've put in the field to control medical cost. We will spend money on many of our transformational initiatives that will produce better baseline medical costs that will put a little pressure on it next year. But we are very determined to control our fixed cost and to leverage our fixed cost, and we think there's upside to the G&A ratio as well.
Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC: Got you. And I'm sorry, so just to clarify, my question on 2019 was with the understanding that premiums probably go from about $17.5 billion this year to maybe just under $17 billion next year now, obviously, a lot better than what you guys were talking about previously. My question was around the earnings. I think you'd made the comment that 2018 that long term you wanted to maintain that level of profits that you're seeing in 2018, that run rate $9.00 number. So, I was just asking more on the combination, if you've got a little bit lower top line on a year-over-year basis, did it sound like earnings per share in your mind for 2019 just directionally would have to take that step back on lower revenues and then eventually get back to where you were, what was that now what you were implying?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Again, without giving a specific forecast, even with the revenue declines next year, we are pretty committed to growing earnings per share and pre-tax earnings off of the 2018 base. Too early to give you the specific 2019 trajectory, but we are committed even in the phase of the revenue decline on the two lost contracts, we're committed to that long-term objective.
Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC: Got you. Got you. That's perfect. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ana Gupte of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Yes, hey. Thanks. Good morning. Yeah. So, again, following up on the margins with the 3-plus net margin that you have right now, do you expect there's still runway for expansion? And is that likely to come mostly from additional mix shifting to the exchanges which are really high margin? Or is there still core MLR improvement from claims editing, payment integrity, PBM, or anything else in Medicare/Medicaid? And then on G&A, are you still looking to drive more efficiency, or are we just looking at leverage at this point as you grow on the cost side anyways?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: With respect to our margins, you specifically, Ana, mentioned Medicaid, with an 89.9% year-to-date MCR, there's still room for improvement in our core Medicaid business, maybe 100 basis points or 200 basis points long term in the MCR. And we're committed to improving our Medicaid margins. On the G&A side, yeah, there's more efficiency, there's fixed cost leverage as we grow, there is more efficiency, and we will redeploy some of that efficiency back to the frontline to make sure that we do not skimp on utilization control resources, which was part of the medical cost problem the company experienced. We also are going to invest in some of these transformational initiatives. It will cost money if we outsource or co-source our IT operation. We are spending more money on payment integrity routines and frontline utilization control. So, there will be a little bit of upward pressure on the G&A ratio as we improve our processes, but it should have a corresponding and exponential effect on our medical cost line.
Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: And then on the rate side, just finally, you have like a mid-60s exchange loss ratio, and you said only one region had the MLR floor issue. But are there any rate pressures that states may be bringing to your attention with such low loss ratios, you're probably not alone? And then on the tax reform side, might they start to put pressure on the rates in Medicaid, is that sustainable over the long run?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: On the second question, the Medicaid rates, it's a very rational rate environment right now as we accept the Medicaid rates that are being offered to us. For the most part, the rates are actuarially sound. They always seem to come in a little bit lower than your absorbed medical cost trend, but they'd suspect you to find managed care savings, and we do that routinely. The tax reform conversation really isn't part of the rate dialogue with the states. On the Marketplace side, we're just now learning how our rates are going to stack up against our competitors. Our average rate increase for the Marketplace that we filed in 2018 for 2019 was 4%. These rate increases no longer need to be corrective, they just need to accurately reflect medical cost trend, the acuity of our population and the metallic benefit designs that we've put into the market. So we're pretty comfortable that our strategy in the Marketplace which was to hold on to our membership ranks and maximize contribution margin dollars for 2019 will hold, and that will position us well to file rates in 2019 that will allow us to grow into 2020.
Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Thanks for the color. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sarah James of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks, and congratulations on the turnaround execution. You've previously talked about focusing on the turnaround before you turn back to top line growth acceleration. Given the progress is running ahead of schedule, how are you thinking about when it's right to explore top line opportunities again thinking specifically of non-incumbent RFPs, M&A, but also anything like organic M&A or fixed (41:30) market expansions? Thanks.
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, as we continue to focus on our margin recovery and sustainability efforts, as you suggested, there is still more to do. Some of those opportunities have yet to been harvested. And that is our primary focus here at the company. In the meantime, we also recognized that the sales cycle in this business is very long. And if you don't start building the engine today to grow, then you won't grow in 2019, 2020 and 2021. So we are hard at work rebuilding our RFP response unit, we're hard at work rebuilding our new contract business development unit. In the meantime, there are plenty of opportunities in our existing footprint, in our existing product line, to grow. If we can win more regions in Texas, when Texas finally announces the STAR+PLUS contract, if we won seven more regions and add our current market share, could be over $1 billion of incremental opportunity. Ohio strongly considering putting their ML – their long-term services and supports business into managed care. So there are plenty of opportunities in Marketplace. We believe that business could be twice the size it is today, and we can hold onto our margin, and have it be a very good allocation of capital in the portfolio at a very attractive margin. So before we go into new-new, I think there's plenty of opportunities in our existing footprint and our existing product line to grow. But in the meantime, we are rebuilding that greenfield business development operation so we can participate in RFPs in 2019, 2020 for the benefit of 2021.
Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: That's very helpful. And one more, you've previously talked about $0.50 upside not in guidance from capital deployment related to debt and converts, can you update us on how much of that has been achieved, and if the remainder is on the table for 2019, or if we should be thinking further out? Thanks.
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: We originally – I gave you a $0.50 estimate, and if you recall, I think at the time, our share price was about $85, which meant that the cash that we've used to buy in the converts was purchasing a lot more of the converts than it is at $125, $130. So, that estimate for the full year is now $0.30, but we've bought in a lot of those convertible notes. We've reduced our share count and the potential volatility in EPS as a result of it. But I think Tom said in his prepared remarks that the estimate for the year on our capital actions is about a $0.30 benefit for the entire year.
Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Tanal of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. So, it seems like you're implying further improvement in the Medicaid loss ratio next year will offset likely lower margins in the Marketplace. And I guess if I think about that, is that now about the TANF population with where the Medicaid sort of loss ratio is running there? And does that become inevitably more dependent on rate updates to the extent that's sort of a lower acuity, lower utilizing population where there's maybe I guess in theory less you can do?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, we definitely think there's upside to our core Medicaid performance. Citing some facts here, TANF is still running over 89% year-to-date. ABD is running at 92% – just under 92%, which is respectable. But we actually think that we can more effectively manage the long-term support and services benefit that's embedded in the ABD product more effectively and we can improve on that 92% performance. And Expansion is doing well at 87%. We're still getting very, very effective rates. So, the business is performing well. I think that there is upside in our ABD line and upside in our TANF line. Just being more effective on the frontlines and the utilization controls, the rate environment if it continues to be stable and we can continue to effectively manage our medical cost baseline and trend, we all believe that there's upside to those performance statistics.
Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, that's really helpful. And just sort of separately on the Marketplace business, kind of given the way minimum MLR rebates are assessed on a rolling three-year basis, is there anything you can tell us about the impact of I guess what would effectively be swapping 2018, obviously really strong year with 2015 less strong on sort of the outlook for earnings or margin next year?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Good observation. The old, poorly-performing years are rolling off, but we still have room. As you suggested, it's a three-year rolling average. We only triggered the minimum MLR in one state, that being New Mexico. And we fully considered our position as we filed our 2019 rates. So, no, we don't expect – the rates that we filed still do not imply a triggering of the minimum MLR in any of our other states. And if we did, we certainly would include it in any forecast we give you for 2019.
Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Awesome. Really helpful. Just lastly for me, just on Marketplace enrollment, the expectations for increased enrollment there, can you talk about any new markets or geographies you're entering, or should we think about that as more of a same-store end-market growth rate?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: We're in seven. We re-filed – if you remember, we were in Utah and Wisconsin a year ago. We came out in 2018. We're going back in for 2019. We expect that Wisconsin and the positioning of our pricing and our product will provide some meaningful membership growth in Wisconsin. Utah, probably less so. But those are the two states. So, we'll be in nine states in 2019 and we're going to consider expanding our Marketplace footprint to be everywhere we're in Medicaid in 2020, which would be I think South Carolina, Illinois and New York.
Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Awesome. Very helpful. Thanks a lot, Joe.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, Joe, thinking about your $500 million plan, just a few sub-part questions here. One, has this year benefited from anything that would have been, say, outside of that plan? Two, you mentioned that you've harvested some of that plan, but still a lot of it to go. Would you care to put numbers on or maybe a proportion of the $500 million that you think you're already seeing flow through the P&L? And then, as you I guess in the extreme, and it's been asked a little bit already this morning, but in the full harvesting of the $500 million, Molina would seem to get to margin levels that would be very high relative to peers. And I guess I'd be curious your view on the difficulty or the reasonableness of pushing margins at Molina kind of to that spread against similar books of business.
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, thanks for the question. And as a reminder, I always remind folks when we talk about these profit improvement plans that one, it first goes to fund any deficit you get in rates. Rates always seem to lag medical cost trend by 1 basis point here or there, and it first goes to fund that. If you remember the charts we showed you at Investor Day, we had this sort of contingency reserve sitting out there suggesting that somewhere you'll get a bad rate, somewhere the rate might be actuarially unsound. And you're always using your profit improvement issues to first offset that deficit before anything drops through. And as you suggest, you're absolutely correct; we would then look at our profit improvement plans and the margins that we're creating as a result of it to reinvest in growth. We would not push margins up as high as you suggest and sacrifice growth when the time comes. So, the $500 million could drop through to margins. And if we aspire to be the best margin producer in the industry, maybe we get there or maybe we'll reinvest it in top line growth. Your original question was about how much of the $500 million has fallen through to 2018. And without parsing it item by item, we definitely benefited this year by more effective utilization management. We definitely benefited this year by working the network harder, claim payment integrity certainly added some benefit this year to our medical cost line. And as we suggested, we continue to be more effective at SG&A control. I would say that the more technically challenging, the more operationally complex items that you saw on our chart at Investor Day still have yet to be harvested. So, bottom line, I would say a significant amount of the $500 million has yet to have been harvested and manifest in earnings. You'll be seeing over the next two to three months announcements from us on partnerships that we are creating with world-class vendors to partner up and take advantage of high acuity care management, maybe a re-contracting of our pharmacy. Clearly, we are anticipating co-sourcing or outsourcing our IT operation, you'll see some announcements for us on that front over the next two to three months.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Steven Valiquette - Barclays Investment Bank: Yeah, thanks, and good morning. I think most of the good questions have been addressed already. Just talk a little bit on that last one. Looking at your citing and throughout this year that some lower in-patient cost has also been part of the upside. So, I was curious kind of where you stand just because (51:44) a little bit deeper on that last question just on the contract renegotiations on the in-patient side, whether that's something that has played a role this year or that's something that's also still kind of ahead of you, just thinking about that category in particular? Thanks.
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah, I think we'd managed our in-patient cost very effectively. We had some cost pressures in Washington that we previously announced. We had some behavioral in-patient pressures in New Mexico that we previously talked about. But for the most part: one, trend seems to be very stable in most regions around the country, so just the general environment for trend; and second, we have been managing it more effectively. And we can see it in all our statistics, admits per 1,000, short in-patient stays, average length of stay, ER visits, admissions out of the ER, whatever stat you want to focus on, we have been managing it very effectively. And so the in-patient and facility costs a component of trend has been: A, stable and performing well; and secondly, we've been managing it better than we had in the past.
Steven Valiquette - Barclays Investment Bank: Yeah, okay. All right. Great, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks. I just wanted to circle back with the G&A commentary because it seems like you're talking, on the one hand, about significant savings, but then also kind of making some investments that might push up G&A with the MLR benefit. And then I guess separately, I guess you're talking about maybe investing for growth in RFPs in the future, I wasn't sure if that was going to put upward pressure on G&A. I guess when you put that altogether, are you looking for G&A as a percentage of revenue to continue to trend down, or this is more about, hey, there's savings that we can reinvest elsewhere to drive improvement elsewhere, either top line or MLR?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Kevin, we're not prepared to give sort of a pinpoint forecast on our G&A ratio beyond 2018. But those are the headwinds and tailwinds to our G&A ratio. And I view the upward pressure – if we continue to invest in things that improve our medical cost baseline; I consider that to be -have an excellent return, and we would make that trade all day long. So, yes, there are going to be some upward pressures as we invest in some of these processes that will produce significant benefits to the company. Certainly, when you're chasing top line revenue, it costs money. But there is more fixed cost leverage and there's more efficiency to be gained in our operation. Those are the ups and downs, but we're just not prepared yet to give you a pinpoint SG&A ratio forecast beyond 2018. But it's there, we're managing it very effectively, and we definitely think there's a more effective way to deploy our SG&A dollars.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then, I guess, when we think about getting back to the growth side of the equation, Molina has been historically much better at protecting and expanding in markets where you already are located. I mean, what do you have to add capability-wise to be successful in entering new markets?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, we are currently sketching out the rebuilding of our business development engine. You need to have a ground game, you need to be in the states developing network relationships and governmental relationships before the procurement drops. And in the past two years, this company has not really invested in any of that given the issues it was going through. So, we're rebuilding all that under Pam Sedmak's leadership. We will develop a new business development engine that we think can compete with our rivals, and we can win our fair share. It's really not about the money, it's about really establishing yourself locally building the relationships with the Department of Health Services and the regulators and making sure you have great network relationships, so when the RFP drops, you're prepared to go.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay.. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Taylor of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, good morning. Really amazing performance this year. So you've done a great job. Two questions about that performance. The first one, just going back to exchanges a little bit, can you help us bridge this comment that you're looking – you're either running or anticipating for the year 9% to 10% after-tax margins in the exchange business with the 58% year-to-date MLR. And I guess presuming some seasonal uptick in the 4Q, maybe you end the year closer to 70%, but still implies somewhere between a 20% and 30% G&A load to only get to a 9% to 10% after-tax margin, can you bridge that for us?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Go ahead, Tom (56:54).
Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. Your numbers are directionally in the right zone there. So in this business, the G&A tend to be high. You have commission, you have sales, marketing. So certainly, it's really in the upper-teen to as much as 20%. And our fourth quarter, you're right, the medical care ratio is going to be higher than what we experienced so far year-to-date. In the last earnings call, we talk a little bit about that, that they tend to be somewhat in the 80s, but we believe that given the trajectory that we are in today, it will be much less than that, more likely start with a seven as opposed to an eight in front.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: So, if we think about ultimately minimum MLRs at 80% in this business and G&A in upper-teens to 20%, I mean that would imply a longer-term after-tax margin significantly lower than the 9% to 10%. Is that how we should be thinking about this? Or do you think you bring G&A down over time to seeing something mid-single digit or better?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Our G&A loads in our product lines that aren't fully scaled are too high, and they can be scaled. If we double the size of the business, our SG&A would not double. There's fixed cost leverage there very, very clearly. The other thing, as a reminder, in the minimum MLR, there's all the add-backs, right? The number we produce for GAAP, there's all kinds of additions and subtractions to get to the number. So, if we're operating in the mid to high-60s with our G&A load of 15% to 20%, we're still floating below the minimum MLR in many of our placements (58:49). But your point is well taken. There is a practical cap in the margins you can achieve because of the minimum MLR, and if we ever get there, it's a high-class problem to have and we'll fully consider it in the rates we file and we'll grow more.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: One other question for you, Joe. Just thinking about your comment that there's still significant amount of the $500 million opportunity you identified that could flow through to earnings. When that takes place, if that does take place, it really seems that you're completely redefining the margin profile with still primarily Medicaid business and redefining that margin profile versus your peers and versus history. And we've always heard companies in this business talk about over caps at the state level, politics and visibility of margins, et cetera. So, in just six months here, you've redefined the profile to some degree and you suggest there's still further to go. How do we think about this historic concept that there were – these are pre-tax caps at the state level...
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: ...and just sort of the visibility of the margins politically?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Oh, it's a very fair comment. And that's why every time I show a forecast or a projection, I always have what I call the rate yield decrement in the analysis because you're never sure that you're going to get fully paid for your medical cost trend. And I always say that over time profit improvement always ends up in rates somehow and somewhere. So, you're right. Over time just through the – the process of negotiating and accepting rates from states, profit improvement will end up in rates over time. That in itself puts a practical (01:00:43) cap in what you can achieve. But again, our goal is to be low cost. We want to be very effective on the frontlines, service our members and our provider partners well, but be low cost. And if we can continue to do that, we can either drop it through or we can reinvest it in top line growth. And that's our aspiration and that's what we're trying to achieve here.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Zack Sopcak of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, thank you for the call, and congrats on the quarter. I wanted to ask first about exiting the Pathways business. If you forget about the – I guess the loss you're taking on the sale of the business, was it a negative or positive earnings contributor in 2018? And should we think about that exit as a tailwind or a headwind going into 2019?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: The exit is clearly a tailwind. It was running an EBITDA loss for the year. If you recall, the goodwill associated with that purchase was written off in the third quarter of 2017, which left a little bit of working capital and fixed assets in the business, and selling it for a nominal purchase price still produced a loss. Negative EBITDA contributor, and it would have required us a lot of future investment in order to fix the business, and there's always a private equity firm around who sees value in that, wants to put the hard work in, but it's just not core and was not a financial contributor.
Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And just on that non-core comment, now that you've exited MMS and Pathways, is there anything else in your portfolio that you would consider non-core that you're still working on, or do you think it's where you wanted to be?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No, we like the portfolio, we like the geographic diversity, we like the product line depth and breadth. The portfolio right now is fine, and we're focused on managed care and that's what our focus is on.
Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, perfect. Thank you for the question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Newshel of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC: Thanks. Do you have a timeline in mind for retiring the remaining convertible debt and warrants? And also do you expect to have more deployable capital from subsidiary dividends next year than you talked about at the Investor Day just given the earnings outperformance this year?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I'll kick it to Tom in a minute, but bear in mind that the 2020s are due in January 2020. So, whether we buy them in the open market or they're presented to us by January of 2020, they will be totally out of our capital structure. Tom, do you want to (01:03:24).
Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: That's right, Joe. There's a balance remaining of approximately $315 million. So, between now and January 2020, we will retire those convertible.
Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC: All right. And then to retire the associated warrants as well, it's like a total of like $1 billion close to?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Exactly. And we're sitting now with close to $400 million in parent company cash. Obviously, with the outlook for next year, I have – we'll harvest more cash flow to the parent. We have the $500 million revolver. So, we have plenty of capacity. As those notes are presented to us or as we go into the market, we have the free cash flow at the parent to buy them.
Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC: Do you have to (01:04:10) be able to do that all next – over the course of next year?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Absolutely.
Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC: All right. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session, and concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky.
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Ryan, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Last night, we've reported second quarter earnings of $3.02 per diluted share. This includes a $79 million positive impact or $0.92 per diluted share from settling the 2017 Marketplace risk adjustment payment. This also includes $0.09 per diluted share negative impact of net expenses primarily related to restructuring and debt extinguishment. Therefore, from a pure performance perspective, netting the $0.83 per share positive impact of these two items, we achieved second quarter fully diluted earnings per share of $2.19. These financial results are a strong indication that the early stages of our margin recovery and sustainability plan are working, as our focus on managed care fundamentals and a more rigorous performance management process is reflected in our improved earnings. Summarizing the key takeaways from the second quarter. Our Medicaid line of business performed slightly ahead of our expectations, and performance improved sequentially in the TANF line of business. The primary driver of improvement was contained to medical cost, particularly inpatient cost. Medicare continued to perform well in the second quarter as the medical care ratio remained flat at 85%, meeting our expectations for the first half of the year. Our SNP and MMP lines of business each contributed to this favorable result. Our Marketplace business has continued to outperform our forecast. It is becoming clear that the price increases we placed in the market along with improved retention of risk adjusted revenue are producing results that are projected to outperform our pre-tax target margin of 4.6%. From a local health plan perspective, our large, high-performing plans have generally continued to perform well. Many of our previously underperforming plans have improved considerably. Additionally, our health plans that are expected to experience major membership transition are also performing well. Our administrative cost ratio decreased to 6.9% in the second quarter and 7.2% year-to-date. This improvement is a combination of continued administrative cost containment and better than expected revenue. And we are committed to harvesting the benefits of administrative cost leverage over time. Finally, we have continued our focus on optimizing our capital structure and business portfolio. We have further reduced our debt, repaid the outstanding balance on a revolving line of credit, simplified our capital structure and have contracted to sell a non-core operating asset to produce additional excess cash at the parent company. Let me now provide a deeper look into the underlying operating levers and metrics. First, with respect to revenues, premium revenue increased by more than 4% from the first quarter of 2018. After setting aside the benefit from the 2017 Marketplace risk adjustment, premium revenue increased by more than 2% sequentially, and met expectations for the quarter. The increase in Medicaid revenue is largely attributable to the nearly 70,000 additional members we awarded in the new statewide Illinois contract that went live on April 1. Second, with respect to our medical care ratio, after removing the impact of the 2017 risk adjustment and CSR subsidies for Marketplace, our consolidated medical care ratio decreased sequentially by approximately 20 basis points to 87% in the second quarter. Across all product lines, we managed to a medical care ratio favorable to our expectations, despite cost pressures in our Washington and New Mexico plans. These results reflect the ongoing medical management improvements and provider contracting initiatives that we outlined at Investor Day as well as a continuation of the stable medical cost trends that began to emerge in the first quarter. Third, with respect to product line performance, our Medicaid business performed better than expected in the quarter. Medical cost trend was well managed, driven mainly by lower than expected inpatient costs. The medical care ratio improved sequentially by 100 basis points from 90.8% to 89.8% with meaningful improvement in the TANF line of business. With a medical care ratio of 90.3% for the first half, our Medicaid product line is performing better than expected, though still with room for continued improvement. Our Medicare line comprising the SNP and MMP products outperformed our expectations. And the medical care ratio was essentially flat compared to the first quarter at approximately 85%. We continue to demonstrate that we have a strong operational foundation for managing high-acuity members, and this point remains important as we contemplate the future growth phase of our long-term strategy. Our Marketplace business has continued to outperform our expectations. As you will recall, despite pricing the business to a 4.6% pre-tax margin, we remain guarded in our assessment of the performance of this business at the end of the first quarter. Now with the benefit of second quarter results, it is becoming clear that our Marketplace performance is exceeding our initial pricing target. Among the factors contributing to this improved performance are three specific insights we have gained as we pass the halfway point of 2018. First, our membership is attriting more slowly than expected, so our premium volume is better than expected. Second, we are outperforming our risk-adjusted revenue forecast. While the positive impact of the 2017 risk adjustment liability settlement is in a sense, non-run ratable, it does however indicate that we will likely outperform the risk adjustment pricing assumption for the 2018 underwriting year, which is now included in our revised guidance. And third, the risk profile of our reduced membership base and the related medical cost experience are consistent with our pricing assumptions. In summary, when scrubbed for the various out of period items, our Marketplace medical care ratio is approximately 69% for the quarter and approximately 66% for the first half of the year. This result is better than our pricing target and significantly better than our previous guidance. I turn now to the individual performance of our local health plans. The majority of our large health plans have continued to perform well and have met or exceeded our expectations. California, Michigan, Ohio, and Texas representing more than 50% of our premium revenue base continued to perform well across most lines of business, earning well in excess of our cost of capital. Washington continued to experience inpatient cost pressures in its Medicaid line of business, though through intense performance management improvements, medical costs have stabilized. We should see improvement in the second half of the year, which will be especially important because our successful re-procurement will yield projected membership increases starting in early 2019. Our two plans that are undergoing significant transition due to contract losses, New Mexico and Florida, continued to produce respectable results. In New Mexico, the Medicaid line has been pressured by higher than expected behavioral cost trends, but Marketplace has exceeded our expectations. Florida is also continuing to experience improved performance sequentially. However, the core performance improvement has been more than offset by a nine-month retroactive increase to the EAPG outpatient fee schedule for $26 million on a pre-tax basis. I turn now to administrative costs. We are continuing to improve our administrative cost structure and lower our G&A ratio through a number of ongoing initiatives. These ongoing efforts, timing effects and the leverage effect of incremental revenue have improved our G&A ratio in the quarter to 6.9%, down from 7.6% in the first quarter. Our near-term focus will be to extract the expenses related to the lost contracts in Florida and New Mexico, and limit the impact of stranded fixed costs for 2019, an outcome we remain committed to achieving. I turn now to the company's revenue and growth profile. We announced three significant RFP awards in the second quarter. First, we won all eight of our Washington re-procurement regions in May, maintaining our statewide presence and adding behavioral health services in all regions. As a reminder, the state has fully carved out the pharmacy benefit effective July 1 of this year which will cause our Washington revenue to decline in the second half by approximately $100 million. This should be offset by membership gains in the behavioral health benefit carve-in in 2019. Second, we were awarded two regions in the Florida Medicaid re-procurement. We are pleased that our negotiations resulted in the award of Regions 8 and 11, overcoming the initial loss of all of our Medicaid regions. In these two regions, we served approximately 100,000 members at the end of the second quarter with approximately $500 million of annualized revenue. Most importantly, this award preserves our ability to continue improving our margins in Florida, while expanding our Marketplace and Medicare businesses in this most important managed care market. Third, and most recently, in Puerto Rico, we've secured an island-wide contract currently scheduled to commence in November. With respect to membership, we had 326,000 members at the end of the second quarter in our two current regions. We are projecting at least a similar number of members in the new program, as we should be well positioned in the auto assignment process. We have also carefully analyzed the rate methodology to assess the profit potential of this market, and we are confident that we will be able to earn and sustain a return in excess of our cost of capital. Finally, a brief update on our New Mexico protest. Our protest is expected to be heard by the court in September. In the interim, a temporary stay we secured allows us to participate in the readiness review process for the new contract award. Until a different outcome is determined, we continue to manage the business as though it is in a run-off status. Changing topics to capital, we made significant progress in the quarter related to our capital structure and free cash flow at the parent. We repaid the outstanding $300 million balance on our revolving line of credit. We repurchased approximately $95 million of our 2020 convertible notes for a total cash outlay of approximately $210 million, reducing both our debt and the dilutive effects of the embedded call option. And as we announced in June, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Molina Medicaid Solutions to DXC Technology for $220 million. We expect this transaction to close sometime in the third quarter. Net of transaction costs and taxes, this sale will generate between $150 million and $180 million of additional parent company cash. I turn now to our revised guidance. Our revised guidance for the year is $7.15 to $7.35 earnings per diluted share on a reported basis, an increase of $3 at the midpoint of our previous guidance range. However, from a pure operational performance perspective, we consider our full year guidance to be approximately $6.30 per diluted share. Allow me to unpack some of the components of our revised guidance. Our first half earnings per diluted share was $4.68. Excluding non-operating, non-run ratable items, we view our pure operating performance in the first half to be $3.70 per diluted share. For the second half, we are projecting earnings of approximately $2.50 to $2.70 per diluted share. Therefore, our full year guidance based on pure operating performance is approximately $6.30 per diluted share at the midpoint. Adding back the $0.96 of previously reported non-operating, non-run ratable items, yields revised guidance of $7.15 to $7.35 per diluted share. Through yet another lens, we view our $3 guidance raise as a $1.20 performance beat for the second quarter, a $1 performance raise for the second half, and an $0.80 increase to the non-run ratable items for the full year. The net income margin in our guidance for the full year is now a range of approximately 2.5% to 2.6%. Excluding the non-run ratable items of $0.96 per share mentioned previously, our guidance net income margin is approximately 2.2%, clearly exceeding our previous guidance range of 1.5% to 1.6%. We are mindful that these results have emerged from improving basic utilization control, claims management, care management and revenue retention processes, all of which are now governed through detailed and rigorous performance management. However, we remain cautious in our outlook as we are still in the early stages of our margin recovery and sustainability plan. We are pleased with the current trajectory of our financial results. If we continue to deliver on the elements of our turnaround plan for 2018, we will have built a strong baseline from which to achieve the 2019 and 2020 margin targets that we conveyed to you at our Investor Day in May. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for more detail on the financials.
Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Joe, and good morning. As described in our earnings release last night, we report earnings per diluted share of $3.02 and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.08, excluding the amortization of intangible assets. As Joe commented, these results were largely driven by our margin recovery initiatives and disciplined performance management. First, let me quickly highlight a few of the items that we call out in our earnings release. The incremental restructuring costs in the quarter are primarily related to the true-up of our initial lease abatement estimates, as we continue to rationalize our office space. We will likely continue to see additional lease restructuring costs over the next few quarters as we continue to rationalize our office space. As part of the 2020 convertible notes and embedded call option repurchase, we incur approximately $5 million of expenses. These costs primarily related to the acceleration of the remaining interest payments on those notes. I will now spend a few minutes discussing our reserve position. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and our position continues to be strong. The favorable development we experienced in 2018 from 2017 has held steady at approximately $220 million, including the explicit margin that we hold. We experienced intra-year favorable development in the quarter, but we intended to and believe that we have re-established the same level of conservatism in the second quarter's days of service medical costs. Days in claims payable are down approximately four days sequentially. The decrease is partially attributable to a reduction in the outstanding balance of provider settlements. Reducing our overall provider settlement balance is a testament to our focus on improving our claims handling protocols. Also, contributing to the decrease were continued improvements in our claims handlings, abilities and improvements in speed of payment. In addition, days in claim payable were also impacted by reserve related to flu costs that were established in the first quarter, but released in the second quarter. And while this may have had a sequential quarterly earnings impact, it has no impact in our first half run rate earnings. Turning to our capital structure and balance sheet, we will continue to look for strategic opportunities to de-lever the balance sheet as we outlined during Investor Day. As of June 30, 2018, the company had unrestricted cash and investments of approximately $350 million at the parent company. We intend to be more capital efficient at the health plan level, ensuring a well consistent and regular dividend flow to the parent company. At the end of the second quarter, our health plans had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately $2.2 billion, which represents approximately 350% of risk-based capital. Let me offer some additional thoughts on our revised guidance. We have raised our full year guidance to a range of $7.15 to $7.35 per diluted share, an increase of $3 at the midpoint from our previous guidance issue on April 30. This increase is comprised of the following. We exceeded our expectations in the second quarter by approximately $1.20 due to strong performance across all product lines. Secondly, we're adding approximately $1 to our original guidance for the back half of the year. We are cautiously projecting that our businesses will continue to perform well even with a substantial seasonal effect of the Marketplace business. The Marketplace medical care ratio excluding non-run ratable items was approximately 66% in the first half of the year. We expect the medical care ratio for the second half to be in the upper 70s as utilization is back-end loaded due to product design and natural shifts in membership mix and acuity. And third, adding approximately $0.80 to the non-operational non-run-rate items for the full year. In developing a revised guidance, we have considered the experience from the first half of the year in projecting the second half. However, we have maintained disciplined and cautious views of our lines of business throughout. Now, to bridge from our results in the first half of the year to our revised guidance in the second half. Our pre-tax income, excluding $84 million of non-run-rate items from our performance in the first half, is approximately $400 million. This compares to a pre-tax income of approximately $250 million in the second half. Approximately two-thirds of the difference in pre-tax income between the first and the second half of the year is related to the seasonality of Marketplace earnings. The remaining difference reflects higher administrative costs in the second half of the year due to the timing of technology and operation initiatives, marketing expenses and transition expenses in Florida and New Mexico. Regarding tax, the full year effective tax rate is approximately 35% to 36%, which is lower than our previous estimate of 38% to 40%. Due to higher pre-tax income in our current guidance, which is taxed at our marginal tax rate of approximately 22%. Finally, let me offer a few additional points of consideration relating to our revised guidance. The 2018 full year impact of our credit facility of repayment and convertible note repurchase, including the impact of the recent 2020 notes repurchase is approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per diluted share. Based on the information we have today, we have not included any potential impact of a retroactive change in the California minimum medical care ratio related to the expansion business for the period July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017. The guidance assumes no prior period development and does not include any additional restructuring costs that we may incur in the back half of the year. Our guidance was developed on the basis of GAAP rather than adjusted earnings per diluted share, which would exclude the amortization of intangible assets. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC: Hi. Thanks. Good morning.
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Good morning.
Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC: I guess the big question – morning, Joe. The big question I guess for me is just the one quarter significant turn in the MLR and the operation improvements that you made and I guess I'm just curious more color on exactly what you're doing and if you could just give us some color on maybe denial rates or pre-authorizations or things like that? Just so we understand what exactly is changing here, especially on the inpatient side?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure, Josh. At Investor Day, we laid out a very clear path to our margin expansion and recoverable – expansion strategy and sustainability, and we identified a portfolio of nearly $500 million of profit improvements to be harvested over a two- to three-year period. Many of those are raw execution at the local level, tiering out high cost providers, re-contracting ancillary services locally, achieving better and more consistent execution of basic utilization controls. This company had inconsistent processes. It had, in some cases, poor execution in some of our local health plans and by a rigorous performance management process, leading indicators that identify the number of authorizations that are going in, so that we can head off high acuity inpatient trends that are emerging, all of these are contributing to the very favorable medical care ratios that we're experiencing in the first half. And I will tell you that the more complicated end of those profit improvement initiatives, outsourcing, co-sourcing some of our specialty utilization controls in other things like that, including PBM re-contracting or adjusting the planning stages and we can provide more margin upside in the future. So at the early stages, we're executing well locally and its managed care fundamentals.
Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC: Got you, that's helpful, and it kind of leads into what my follow-up question would be, which is talk – you guys are sort of at that 2.2% which is kind of you were just at the $6.30, implies sort of a 2.2% margin which is at the low end of that target range that you guys laid out for 2020 or 2021, so it sounds as though you guys are two, maybe even three years ahead of schedule, your comments there make it sound like there's actually more opportunity, so I guess, as we think towards 2019, are we already in a position to say that that 2.2% to 2.7% is too conservative? Is there more upside in the potential margin going forward?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: At this early stage, Josh, we're willing to say and express a high degree of confidence in the margin ranges that we conveyed to you at Investor Day. I think as we get closer to developing our 2019 plan and look at where medical cost trends are landing, or looking at the strength of the rates that we're receiving from the states, we'll be in a better position to perhaps update those target margins, but at this point, at this early stage, we will convey to you that we are expressing a high degree of confidence in the margins that we projected.
Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC: And one last one, I apologize for asking third one, but the 2019, as you guys look at it today, assuming that maybe New Mexico doesn't go your way or what have you, do you know what is your run rate? What is your 2019 revenue run rate look like today excluding any other additional changes?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I think if you take a look at the Investor Day projection which included the complete loss of Florida Medicaid and the complete loss of New Mexico Medicaid and just pro forma back in $5 million to $550 million of recovery for Regions 8 and 11 in Florida, that's probably the one adjustment I would make to the revenue outlook we gave you at Investor Day. There's other puts and takes. Washington will probably have better membership next year due to our successful re-procurement. That might be aided by the behavioral benefit carve-in, but offset by the pharmacy carve-out. So there's all types of puts and takes, but I think the major item would be Regions 8 and 11, $5 million to $550 million of revenue in addition to the outlook we gave to you at Investor Day.
Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC: Okay. So Washington...
Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: (32:02) offer one additional data point there is that we're obviously looking at the Marketplace and there are two markets that we have filed rates for which is Wisconsin and Utah that we may consider a re-entry. We will make that decision until a little bit later in the year, but that's also a potential upside in our premium income as well.
Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: The next question comes from Matt Borsch of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Matt Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yes. Thank you. Maybe I just pick up on that last comment. What is it that you would be waiting to see regarding the decision to re-enter or not Wisconsin and Utah?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Our decision to file the rates and then just pause until open – you have until open enrollment to make that decision. And I just think it's prudent to see every bit of data off your 2018 performance. The issues we had in Utah and Wisconsin were mostly related to a network that was too wide and too highly priced. And the team is working at developing a network that will support the prices that we file. I would suffice it to say that I'm inclined to say that we would re-enter, but we don't have to make a decision until the end of the summer. We're going to watch every bit of data emerge on 2018 to make sure we have this right and then we'll make the call at that point.
Matt Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): That makes sense. And can you just talk to us about the – you mentioned probably not a huge thing, but the little bit of pressure in New Mexico from higher behavioral costs?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. New Mexico obviously is experiencing an epidemic of sorts of opioid substance abuse, opioid use disorder and the incidence rate is quite high. And it is putting pressure on the Medicaid line of business. We're on it. We're delivering the services we need to deliver. It's really not been reflected in the rates we got. So it's putting pressure on the MLR, but it's really that pure and simple that's what it is.
Matt Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Does that relate at all to the IMD exclusion lifting in terms of what might be new?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No, I don't believe so. I think it literally is just a one component of medical cost trend that is racing ahead of our price to expectation.
Matt Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): All right. Thank you.
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: The next question comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: Thanks. Good morning. Joe, you mentioned being well positioned to hit 2019 and 2020 margin targets. But obviously, your current 2018 guidance is already at the high end of the 2019 1.9% to 2.2% target.
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: Obviously a high class problem to have, but I was hoping you can give us some color on where you think 2018 results may not be sustainable, like what portions of this 2018 upside might not be sustainable into 2019. Particularly, can you tell us where exchange margins sit for 2018 versus that 4.6% target?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. With respect to the Marketplace business, the rates that we filed are no longer what I'll call corrective. The last two rate filings were clearly corrective rate filings to get our prices where they needed to be in order to have a margin that is in excess of our cost of capital. The prices we put into the market this year that we filed are more reflective of the acuity of the members we think we'll attract, any benefit changes, although that's pretty limited in this product line, and medical cost trend. The strategy for 2019 in the Marketplace was to optimize our contribution margin, not to grow membership considerably, but not to allow it to attrit considerably due to competitive pressures. So, our outlook for 2019 Marketplace should be maximize margin, hold onto membership and let's see what happens, so that we can perhaps grow this business more aggressively in 2020. With respect to the core business, look, we're operating pretty well. Our Medicaid line of business at 90% for the first half. TANF at 90%, we think can still be a little bit better. ABD at 93%, we think there's more opportunity there. Expansion at 87% is probably where it needs to be. And our Medicare line of business at 85% is doing well from a medical margin point of view. The SG&A ratio is still a bit high. So there is more opportunity here. It's all about the rates and the strength of the rates you get. And as we also said at Investor Day, we always put in a hedge for medical cost trend inflections that you don't anticipate or a bad rate here and there. So, we remain guarded and cautious, but obviously, we're off to a good start and we still think there's plenty of opportunity for improvement.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: Got it. So, if I could just follow up here. One, I'd asked about where your exchange margins are for 2018 versus that 4.6% target. Can you give us an idea? I mean, are they closer to 10% than 5%?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: In this first half...
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: (37:19) but I'm just trying to figure out magnitude.
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. On an adjusted basis, I mean, you really have to scrape out the CSR subsidy and the noise. If you scrape out the noise, we did just under 10% for the first half and I'll remind you that has the seasonality effect of the business. In the back half, we're projecting to be slightly over breakeven. And on the same basis of the target pricing margin of 4.6%, the guidance margin for Marketplace is just under 5.5%. So, we're beating the – our guidance calls for a beat to our 4.6% target pricing margin.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: Got it. So then, I guess, so if margins and exchanges aren't going to be that big a headwind considering they are only slightly above your target and you're pricing to your target next year, what is the big headwind to next year? I think a lot of people when they look at these margins that you reported this year, that you updated guidance for, would look and say geez, it looks like it gives you the opportunity to kind of get to the 2020 margin in 2019. What's going to – in your mind, what are the key factors that kind of keep you from doing that? Are you going to guide to that 1.9% to 2.2%, meaning earnings is actually down next year versus this year, because that's what it sounds like you're saying.
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Obviously, we're not going to be giving 2019 guidance at this early stage, but...
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: Sure.
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: ...in tracking the moving pieces, the major profit improvement initiatives that are what I call enterprise-wide, re-contracting our PBM, perhaps re-contracting some of our specialty UM, perhaps outsourcing or co-sourcing some of our IT and transaction services operations that would provide significant benefits along the lines that we conveyed to you at Investor Day, those are still in the planning stages and will provide benefit in 2019 and 2020. I always remain cautious about the rates we're going to get. Right now, the rate environment is what I consider stable. It's mostly meeting the actuarially soundness standard. It generally reflects the trends we are experiencing, but I always just remain guarded on the strength of the rates we're going to get. So if rate environment remains stable and strong and our profit improvements take hold as we think they will, perhaps there is upside, but again, it is too early in our turnaround plan to begin conveying expanded margins to what we conveyed to you at Investor Day. Let's wait till the end of the year, see how 2018 plays out, and when we give you 2019 guidance, hopefully there could be positive news there.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: Thanks for all the color.
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: The next question comes from Ana Gupte of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So the first question was about the SG&A guidance which you reiterated rather than I thought might be that there may be some improvements for 2018 and can you give us any sense of the outlook into 2019, given you've been taking down a lot of your corporate overhead and the like?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. We remain committed to the operating leverage, that is we're holding our operators accountable to actually holding fixed costs fixed and only adding a variable cost when volume is involved. Second, we continue to chip away. No major announcements, but every day, every month we find new opportunities. In the quarter, our administrative costs were sort of flat quarter-over-quarter. So the reduction in the G&A ratio was actually a function of the revenue line, rather than the cost line, and we do have a backend loaded SG&A forecast. The SG&A forecast is $50 million higher in the back half of the year than the front half as we deferred some improvement projects. We have the New Mexico and Florida transition cost to incur, and Medicare marketing season opens as you know in October, November. So there's potential upside there, but right now we're comfortable at our original guidance of 7.4%, and any reduction in that clearly is coming from the revenue line and not the cost line at this early stage.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: That's helpful. Thanks. So moving to revenue, can you give us an update on the Texas RFP and the resubmission by the 22nd, what is the timing on that and what kind of converse are you having?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: The resubmission was actually almost a nonevent. The RFP came out on July 23rd I believe, we have 30 days, so it's late August when it's due. There was only one noticeable change. So there was no change to the very technical requirements. They only gave you 30 days to respond, so they couldn't change much technically, what they did include was a more subjective element to the evaluation process to where the raters and the evaluators can inject more subjectivity and judgment into the raw scoring. Rates were still not part of the bid. We were comfortable and confident in our original submission. We remain comfortable and confident with our resubmission, and we're still hopeful that our six regions in Texas can expand to something north of 6% and south of 13% and we can expand our ABD revenue in Texas as a result of this. So we still remain very bullish and optimistic on the prospects there.
Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I would add one more data point to that, to what Joe said is that the go live day has been pushed back...
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure.
Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: ...by approximately five months, so it is now June 1, 2020.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: And the awards will still be in October to choose, I couldn't find that on the website?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: They have not given a date. They have not updated the date that they indicated they would announce the award. So we don't actually know.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Got it. One last one then, just you're getting to a point where just within a pretty short period of time you have shown remarkable turnaround, but there still seems a lot of runway for MLR improvements and broader margin expansion, would you consider maybe as new RFPs like North Carolina in particular, which is coming any day, bidding for that at this point or might you just stick with the, let's get through our margin turnaround and be cautious and that does put a dent a little on the potential growth for 2020?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Ana, it's the latter. We have to stay focused and committed to our margin recovery. And the keyword here is sustainability. That's the key question for us, that's the key question for you. And we actually think we are at the early stages of improving our core processes, the infrastructure to support the complexity of the revenue we take on in order to sustain these margins. And as I mentioned before, if we continue to be in a stable and actuarially sound rate environment and those profit improvement initiatives we conveyed to you at Investor Day, there could be margin upside here, but we remain committed and focused to the sustainability and margin expansion. And we have enough revenue right now to consider this a very solid franchise. We have a Mississippi implementation going in. We have an Idaho expansion. There's a potential LTSS opportunity in Ohio a year, year-and-a-half out. So there's plenty of growth opportunity in our existing footprint that we can focus on as we expand our margins and not get distracted with greenfield opportunities.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Super helpful. Thanks so much.
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: The next question comes from Steve Tanal of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess, just on the risk adjustment side, while certainly, I guess, not run ratable at this level, it does seem like you'd be setting up for another risk adjustment gain next year related to this plan of yours, so how do you suggest we sort of think about that year-to-year step down given the smaller overall footprint? And is that something you'd include in guidance as you approach next year?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, I think, Steve, I would make two comments. One, getting better at accounting for it is only half the battle, we actually have to get better at doing it and getting risk scores that are commensurate with the acuity of our population. We clearly got better at accounting for it, but we are actually getting better at actually doing it, and having a profit improvement emerge out of the improved risk scores that we're harvesting. I would tell you that the first half of 2018, our revenue profile on the revenue that we booked for the first half is reflective of the experience that emerged off of 2017, whether there's upside to that or not we'd have to wait and see. But the 2018 revenue is being recorded on the same basis of the experience that emerged out of 2017.
Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And then, so would 2019 guidance include some expectation of how that will run rate next year or would you exclude that from guidance kind of going forward?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, I'd answer the question maybe slightly differently than you even asked it, it's a question of how did we price? And again, when you're filing rates three, four months into a year that has experiences yet to emerge, you're forced to be cautious and conservative. So the 2019 rates that we filed actually included a risk adjustment outlook that was pretty consistent with the 2017 experience that emerged into 2018 and the 2018 experience that we have currently. If we get better at actually harvesting the risk adjustment scores that would be upside to our 2019 performance.
Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Understood. That's helpful. Okay. And then just excluding the risk adjustment, it would still look like there was a big drop in marketplace PMPMs especially sequentially I guess is the way we'd look at that. And I'm kind of curious to understand what drove that and I guess in doing that math, are we correct to adjust the CSR out of expenses as opposed to premiums?
Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: That's correct, Steve. CSR is really a adjustment to the medical costs and if you look at the Q2 premium for marketplace, it is benefited from the risk adjustment from 2017. So that's why you had a little bit of a artificial lift, if you will. If you adjust it out, then Q1, Q2, they're fairly stable, Q1 stepping up to Q2 slightly roughly about $15 million, $16 million. So that's really the picture.
Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. So follow-up, it looks like a bigger step-up, but okay, and just lastly for me. In Washington, can you give us a flavor for the PMPM value of the RX carve-out versus the behavioral carve-in, are those pretty similar? And then may be just a little color on sort of the net impact of both of those as well as the membership gains as you enter 2019. It sounds like you're saying are net positive overall. And that's all I had. Thanks.
Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Let me comment on the pharmacy carve-out, which was effective July 1 of this year. So, as Joe commented before, it's approximately $100 million of back half premium reduction. So behavioral health, on the other side, does not kick in until the first part of 2019. So there is a timing issue there, but what Joe commented before is that we feel optimistic that we will expand membership in 2019. So on top of picking up the behavioral health premium, then it possibly may more than balance out the loss of the pharmacy revenue.
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: The behavioral carve-in was worth about 10 percentage points in the rate, if you can use that in your model that might help you.
Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's perfect. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. And I appreciate the detail on the clean EPS, it's very helpful. But I was hoping you could also put the progress in terms of the $400 million to $600 million savings target laid out at Investor Day? And then which buckets would you say you're close to hitting the goal on? So, for example, it sounded like network and payment integrity were maybe the furthest along, this were laid out as being maybe up to $85 million, so if you could give us some perspective on those buckets and where you are in achieving them? Thank you.
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. I will say in the early stages here, the profit improvement is emerging out of better execution of utilization management on the front lines in the local health plans, one. Second, re-contracting, tiering out high cost facilities, re-contracting with re-contracted behavioral services in various geographies with outsourced vendors. So re-contracting utilization control and we've gotten a lot better at claims handling. When we say there's less going into the provider settlement pot, I mean that gets expensive. And so we're just getting better at straight through processing, auto adjudication, our rework rates are down, our provider settlements are down, more to go there, but it's all contributing to the early success we're experiencing here. I'd say those were the three major categories and better risk adjusted revenue retention. Those are the four categories that we're probably hitting hard right now. The enterprise-wide initiatives, all the re-contracting, potential outsourcing in the works, plans in place, execution for 2019 and 2020.
Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Can you comment to where you are towards hitting the $400 million to $600 million target?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: It's really hard to say. Many of the let's say locally deployed initiatives are hitting, the bigger ticket ones or not, but clearly when we developed our 2018 plan and looked at the strength of our rates, we know we needed more locally deployed profit improvement initiatives. In fact, when Hampstead Mac joined us we added over 100 basis points of revenue to everybody's profit improvement plan. So it's hard to say how much of the $500 million was actually harvested to date, but most of this is raw execution on the front lines on the three or four core processes that I mentioned. When develop our 2019 plan or perhaps at our next Investor Day, we'll do our re-accounting for the $500 million of opportunity, so you know how much is left, but I would tell you that a significant portion of that, the enterprise-wide initiatives has yet to have been harvested.
Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: That's helpful. And then on California, it looked like there was a good improvement on MLR there. I wanted to understand, was that just tax related or was there a meaningful improvement on the Medicaid side or anything out of period impacting California? Thank you.
Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: These are basics fundamental of execution on our plan and that's why you see California has some improvement. There's also some – if you look at California first half – first quarter, second quarter, I mean loss ratio improved quite a bit. And that's pretty much across a lot of lines of business as well.
Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, Joe, in your prepared remarks, you talked about the better performance on risk adjustment, and you expected that to flow through and that that was specifically now incorporated into your guidance. And so, I guess I'm wanting to perhaps parse apart the benefit that I believe you're calling out for 2Q from 2017 risk adjustment and perhaps the benefit that maybe you're including as run ratable in 2018 that would have come from what I believe you're saying is a lower risk adjustment payable accrual for 2018. Am I understanding that correctly?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. I think it's fair to say that our first half results, there's always puts and takes for the quarter as you adjust your outlook. But the first half results are a fair reflection of the strength of our risk adjustment position for 2018. So I would ask that – as we talked about a $3.70 pure performance first half that is reflective of our 2018 risk adjusted revenue outlook for the marketplace.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Got it. And similarly all incorporated into the 5.5% that you answered to Justin?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: That is correct.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Right. Okay. And looking at some of your variance around your rates in the exchange business, you have a couple states where it looks like you're looking for double-digits in a couple of states, where you're bigger, you're looking Texas and Washington for example in the low double digits and New Mexico, Michigan may be closer to flat. Can we think about kind of specifically in exchange, are those being reflective of particularly the lower ones, where maybe you're kind of over earning and believing that you're hitting caps and essentially bidding back to a normal margin?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Fair point. The only plan where we're bumping up against the minimum MLR is New Mexico.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Okay.
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Because it's a three-year rolling average, we still have enough of the old experience in the calculation where we're generally avoiding that for this year and probably for next. It's a very fair characterization that our rates are no longer corrective. They are now reflective of the acuity of the membership we believe we will track, of the trends we are experiencing and always with an outlook of where the competitors are. So this is a blind bidding process as you know, so you could talk to yourself and convince yourself that your rates are okay and you'll track membership, but you always have to have an outlook of where is your product price juxtaposed against the competitors, where do you think they'll land so you have an outlook of what type of membership. So we do a very detailed elasticity of demand study on where our pricing is. And that's how we prepare our rates, whether they're mid single-digits or low double-digits, it's always reflecting trend and then juxtaposed against where we think our competitive pricing is, and where the competitors will land, so we can attract the membership we plan to attract.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Appreciate that. And then last one real quickly, as you've now made substantial progress in cleaning up the balance sheet and you're obviously focused on profit improvement and organic operations here, but as you start to generate some cash flow and don't have balance sheet applications for that in the immediate, how do you think about capital allocation, say, beyond the very near-term?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, right now, we're still focused on our recovering sustainability plan. We are not really looking for inorganic opportunities. I will tell you that in the near-term opportunities that we've identified in some of our existing footprint, if we can harvest that revenue over the next year or two, it will require risk-based capital to be deployed in our local health plans. So as we outlined to you at Investor Day, there is $1.5 billion to $3 billion of opportunity, we only squeeze $600 million out per year for each of the following two years. If we went more aggressively at that, figure around 10% to 15% of that revenue being tucked away as statutory capital, which by the way is the highest and best use of excess cash flow, as it produces north of 30% levered returns. So we're very focused on driving the value of our business through our existing footprint first. We will look to then greenfield opportunities later and if our currency trades well and we can get back in the M&A game at some future date, then we would do that. But right now focusing on organic growth opportunities that will require our free and excess cash flows to be deployed locally as statutory capital.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Appreciate the answers. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks. Just wanted to kind of follow up on one of some of the earlier lines of questioning just because the order of magnitude of performance and improvement this year is pretty surprising. So I just wanted to understand if there is anything else kind of this year that looks maybe one-time in nature. I guess you mentioned $26 million of Florida retroactive payments. But is there anything like that that says that this base might not be quite the starting point when thinking about 2019?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No, I think we tried to give you all a very clear picture over how the business was performing and we actually think that first half sort of pure performance picture of $400 million pre-tax, 240-plus million after tax and $3.70 is a very clean and accurate view of how the business is performing. There's puts and takes all over, but for the most part with respect to our product lines, our local health plans all aggregating to the consolidated view we, think that's a pretty good picture.
Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I would also add to what Joe said here. I'm sorry. But we have a very high visibility to our premium rates already for the year. So that's pretty good locked in pretty close to 100% that we know about. So the balance is really managing our medical cost structure. So we have good sense on that side, so that give us comfort level to look at second half of the year.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then, with the Medicaid Solutions sales, it looks like they didn't generate much gross profit at all. Does that mean that it was losing money on a net income basis, so divesting that business is going to be accretive even before you take into account what you do with that cash?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No, it's pretty much a push on the EPS line. If you assume you're going to repay debt with the proceeds, it's a push on the EPS line. It generated about $30 million of EBITDA and $7 million of EBIT on an annualized basis. So the multiple we got for it was actually quite attractive. But it's a push on the EPS line if you assume we'll repay debt.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: All right. Great. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. You touched on this a little bit but for the Marketplace business, just to kind of clarify a little bit further. Separate from your decision whether or not to re-enter Utah and Wisconsin, just based on your pricing strategy, are you budgeting right now for membership growth in the Marketplace in 2019 in the existing states or do you anticipate just based on your pricing strategy it's more likely it could be down or is it still really just too early to tell?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: It is too early to tell. But I can only tell you what we strove to achieve in our pricing strategy, which was to – except for Utah and Wisconsin which are separate, to maintain the membership profile that we have and maximize the contribution margin dollars. And so put a price in the market that remained competitive juxtaposed against the competitors that would show well on the exchange, maintain the membership profile, don't try to grow it, but make sure it doesn't attrit, and maximize the contribution margin dollars. That was the strategy. And then of course, if we're successful in launching Utah and Wisconsin, that would be added membership. But the strategy wasn't to grow it or let it attrit. It was to maintain it and maximize profit.
Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Then just a real quick housekeeping question, for the $79 million risk adjustment payment, thinking about how that may have been allocated by state, is it safe to assume that some of the states where you have the lowest Marketplace MLRs like in California and Florida probably had the heaviest weighting of the risk adjustment payment in 2Q 2018?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah.
Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I mean, you obviously had a 28% Marketplace MLR in Cali, 39% in Florida. But then Texas is your biggest state but that actually had one of the highest state MLRs in the Marketplace at 73%. So I was just kind of curious just to kind of confirm what's probably obvious around the allocation there.
Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Sure. Very fair question. And the bulk of this risk adjustment item from 2017 pertain to the largest states such as Texas, and the rest I won't go into the detail of that, but certainly if you look at from an allocation perspective, the typical market share that you see from our Marketplace state-by-state, that will be a way to look at it. But Texas is certainly the lion's share of that adjustment.
Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: No, it is. Okay. Okay. All right, great. Thanks.
Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: The next question comes from Gary Taylor of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. A lot of my questions have been answered. Just one quick one on the Florida out-of-period benefit which looks like it would've been $0.31. I mean, the reason you don't I guess sort of back that out of kind of the clean earnings number or the go-forward number is just that there's probably other smaller positive, negative adjustments throughout the quarter or various quarters. Is that why that wasn't explicitly sort of backed out like say $0.96 plus?
Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Gary, I'm not sure when you say the Florida adjustment, I'm not sure, what you...
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah, maybe we didn't understand. This was a earlier comment, but I thought you said the quarter included $26 million pre-tax of out-of-period payments in Florida related to I think the higher outpatient fee schedule which...
Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah, yeah. That's correct. Yes, the industry in Florida was handed $185 million update to the EAPG Fee Schedule, $26 million of it related to us, we recorded it in the quarter. Yeah, there were other, I mean, there's so many other puts and takes in the quarter, we thought we'd call it out, because it was sort of an industry phenomenon and it was sort of known out there and clearly something that masked the true performance, the core performance of Florida was actually pretty good this year and it sort of masked that. So we thought we'd call it out. But that's what that's related to.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then my other question is as we think about, Joe you had mentioned this, limiting, minimizing the impact of stranded costs as you exit New Mexico and Florida Medicaid revenues. And you said you're committed to that, I guess the question is how should we think about that in terms of a 2019 headwind. When you say limit the impact, is it plausible to get that to something that's fairly de minimis in terms of EPS impact or it's going to be a measurable impact regardless but you're going to get it as low as possible?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, if you recall in our margin projection, we included $50 million pre-taxed of a headwind in 2019 due to stranded fixed costs for the combination of New Mexico and Florida. The fact that we've actually now retained over $500 million of our Florida revenue, that $50 million is more like $40 million. So it's already included in our margin forecast for 2019, but I'm not satisfied until we actually try to solve for it. We just thought it was prudent and cautious to say it could get stranded, but we have teams of people who are working on extracting the variable costs, the step variable costs and the next step would be get at the fixed cost that could get stranded if we don't get at it quickly. So we are committed to trying to outperform that assumption, but it was already included in our 2019 margin projection.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: That's a good reminder. I appreciate it. And last follow on to that would be New Mexico, I think, has been unprofitable from Medicaid perspective, you talked about behavioral being an issue, so I'm presuming kind of all-in that's still unprofitable, so is there a measurable EPS tailwind as you exit the New Mexico Medicaid or that's sort of encapsulated in some of the stranded cost estimate also on a net basis?
Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No, when we projected 2019 margins, we extracted the contribution margin from the Medicaid business. As I said, included the stranded fixed cost, that's already been embedded in there.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Got it.
Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yes. It's already been embedded in our forecast.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: The next question comes from Zack Sopcak of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, thanks for the question. Can I just ask quickly on cash flows in the quarter, operating cash flows turned negative after a strong first quarter, anything in there surprising or was that in line with how you're thinking about how they would sequence through the year?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Mostly timing of – I'll kick it to Tom, but mostly just the timing of cash flows related to some of the receivables we carry. Tom, you want to elaborate?
Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Sure. I mean, you look at the operating cash flow, it was down definitely and primarily related to the receivable and the timing of receipt of premium in certain states, some of the larger states California, Florida, Ohio, Washington, they're more or less temporary in nature. And also we have HIF, health insurance fees receivable that we don't get settled with say until later part of the year. And one other data point is that with the reduction in our Marketplace membership, went down by more than half, you would see that medical claims payable related to that also came down. Therefore it'll affect cash flow as well.
Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That makes a lot of sense. That helps, thanks. And quickly just one of the first questions I asked about 2019 revenue discussion you had at Investor Day, and you talked about potentially a tailwind from Florida and you talked about puts and takes on Washington, does Puerto Rico expansion at all factor into that or is it too early to have an idea of what impact that could have for next year?
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Puerto Rico could provide some upside, but we did not include any upside. At the time, we prepared our forecast...
Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah.
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: ...it was unclear whether we'd even be successful in Puerto Rico. Now that we have been, we're actually pretty confident that we'll do very well in the auto assignment process for the Commonwealth, and we could see some membership growth from our 320,000 members, but that was not included in our forecast at the time, nor was any loss of membership. We pretty much forecasted status quo.
Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great, thank you. And congrats on the quarter.
Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: This concludes today's question-and-answer session and today's conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joseph Zubretsky.
Joe Zubretsky: Thank you, Ryan, and thank you all for joining us this morning. The financial results that we announced today reflect a good first step toward our goal of sustainable margin recovery. First quarter earnings were $1.64 per diluted share and included $0.38 of net favorable impact not contemplated in our original preliminary guidance. These results are a significant improvement over 2017 and are favorable to our expectation. As a result of these developments, we have increased our full year 2018 guidance to a range of $4 to $4.50 per diluted share. When we analyze the business by key operating metrics, product line or local health plan, we met or exceeded our expectations, modest as they were along nearly all dimensions. To summarize the key takeaways from the first quarter, our medicated Medicare products combined performed well. This improvement despite a higher than normal flu season was primarily due to our medical cost management initiative and better than expected retention of at risk revenue. The performance of our marketplace business exceeded our expectations as the significant price increases replaced into the market were more than competitive and allowed us to surpass our membership forecast particularly in Texas, our most profitable market. From a local market perspective, our large high performing plans continue to perform well in the aggregate despite higher than expected medical costs in Washington. In our underperforming markets, our newly implemented intense and rigorous performance improvement processes began to show signs of success particularly in Florida and Illinois. Our administrative cost improvement plan continue to reflect favorably in our results as evidenced by our lower administrative expense ratio. Finally, our focus on balance sheet discipline not only avoided the unfavorable prior year reserve development that we saw throughout 2017 but rather produced significant favorable prior year development in the quarter as a result of a more conservative approach to estimating our claims liability at December 31. We attempted to maintain that same degree of conservatism when we established reserve at the end of the first quarter and if time proves we were successful in doing so, the net impact of prior period development on our first quarter results will have been minimal. Taking a step back, we see an emergency theme. Our operating metrics on a consolidated basis developed favorably with respect to revenue, medical care ratio and G&A profile by both product line and local health plan. Reviewing the results from these different vantage points helps us test and evaluate the quality of earning and the sustainability of our first quarter trajectory. After this multi-dimensional review, I will then consider the company's revenue and growth profile and conclude my remarks with a discussion of revised guidance. First, revenue; premium revenue decreased approximately 7% when compared with the first quarter of 2017. This decrease was a direct result of the membership declines related to the significant marketplace price increases that we implemented as part of our margin improvement and sustainability plan. We now have over 450,000 marketplace members which exceeds our forecast as our prices while having been increased by an average of nearly 60% remained competitive. Medicare and Medicaid revenues were essentially flat as a slight membership decline in Medicaid was offset by a low single-digit rate increases and favorable at risk revenue retention. Second, our medical care ratio, removing the impact of the 2017 CSR benefit recorded in the quarter, our consolidated medical care ratio improved to 87.7% from 88.4% in the first quarter of 2017. This improvement reflects stronger medical management performance resulting in favorable medical cost trends that were partially offset by a lower mix of marketplace revenue. On balance inpatient and physician utilization as well as unit costs were well managed in the quarter while pharmacy costs ran higher than expected. This netted to an overall favorable medical cost trend despite the higher pharmacy costs and approximately $18 million of above normal flu expense. We have also started to see some of the early benefits from contracting efforts that we undertook last year in California, Florida, South Carolina and Texas where we eliminated or renegotiated high cost provider contracts for inpatient and ancillary services. The catch all of our performance, our net profit margin was 2.3% and benefited from the net favorable impacts not contemplated in our original preliminary guidance. Without accounting for these net favorable impacts, our net profit margin squarely landed at 1.8% a significant improvement over any prior period. We will continue to make every effort to ensure this progress is sustainable. Third, I would like to take a deeper look at performance by product line, starting with Medicaid. In [indiscernible] product, the medical care ratio of 92.7% was slightly improved from the 93.1% ratio in the first quarter of 2017. This result modestly underperformed our expectations due to high acuity inpatient cases in Washington and higher behavioral healthcare costs in New Mexico. We continue to work to improve utilization controls in the care management for this product line. Our Medicaid expansion medical care ratio was 85.2% compared to 84.4% in 2017. This was in line with our expectations as the increase over the prior year was primarily due to the premium reduction that took place in California last July. This product has remained very successful for us as rate adequacy has trended favorably and membership is concentrated in our higher performing health plans particularly California, Michigan and Ohio. The aged blind and disabled product perform notably better compared to the first quarter of 2017 as it's MCR improved to 92.1% from 94.5%. The year-over-year improvement can be attributed to our continued advancement of the following key high acuity management fundamentals. First we are improving our care management and coordination of services for high acuity populations focusing on the integration of behavioral and physical health services. Second, we are targeting high risk members for care management intervention and more comprehensive documentation of medical conditions. And third, we are improving our management of community and other long-term care services for members in this product line. Continuing the product line review, and turning now to Medicare. For our SNIP and MMP programs combined, the medical care ratio improved by nearly 300 basis points to 84.8% this quarter from 87.7% in the first quarter of 2017. Much of this improvement is a result of increased retention of at risk revenue. The Medicare business also benefited from favorable medical cost trends and improved medical management of inpatient utilization. Michigan which has about 25% of our Medicare membership has shown particular improvement this quarter. Accurate and complete risk for documentation and effective management of chronic and high acuity conditions are critical to the successful management of this product. To round out the review by product, now with respect to the marketplace business. Marketplace is off to a stronger start this year compared to last and has performed above our expectations. The medical care ratio for the marketplace business decreased to approximately 67% excluding the impact of the 2017 CSR benefit recorded in the quarter down from 75% in the first quarter of 2017. This 800 basis point improvement is a direct result of our pricing strategy. When considering this improvement, it is important to note several factors. First, approximately 70% of our members this year are renewing members from 2017. And as such we believe we have a more stable risk pool. Second, member demographics, risk scores and acuity all generally came in within the assumptions used in our pricing, which as you recall targeted a 4.6% pre-tax margin. Third, while it is still early in the year and our membership remains largely similar to last year, we have seen a change in composition to more brands and fewer still members. Since we have priced all of our products to the same target margin on a standalone basis, this shift should be margin neutral. I turn now to the fourth dimension of my review of the quarter a review by geography of the individual performance of our local health plans. The majority of our large health plans have produced and continued to produce after tax margins that exceed our target. The combined performance of these large well performing health plans, California, Michigan, Ohio, Texas and Washington remain consistent with our expectations. Ohio's performance improved over the first quarter of 2017 across all products. While we saw pressure in Washington related to high acuity inpatient cases. With respect to Washington we believe this experience is within the level of quarterly variability in medical cost that can be experienced from time to time. One of our greatest margin enhancement opportunities is to turn around our underperforming health plans. Florida and Illinois are excellent examples of how our rigorous management process and a disciplined Profit Improvement Plan can produce positive results. Illinois in particular has improved across all lines of business and the new health plan management team has been extremely focused on improving operations. Fifth and finally, I turn to corporate administrative expenses. We continue to see the full run rate impact of our prior cost actions reflected in reduced administrative expense and a correspondingly lower G&A ratio. Our G&A ratio in the quarter was managed to 7.6% down from 8.9% in the first quarter of 2017. If we exclude the impact of marketplace broker commissions and exchange fees, our G&A ratio declined to 6.8% in the first quarter of this year from 7.5% in the first quarter of 2017. This improvement highlights the effects of our previous restructuring efforts and we continue to identify additional cost reduction opportunities across the organization. For instance, we recently eliminated approximately 100 positions for an annual savings in excess of $10 million. We will continue to restructure inefficient processes and find opportunities for headcount reductions as doing so has a very short payback. I will now briefly discuss the company's revenue and growth profile although we have pushed the pause button on new revenue opportunities while we execute our margin recovery plan, reprocurement of existing revenue remains an intense focus. We have submitted bids for Texas Starplus, Washington Medicaid and the Puerto Rico Medicaid program because we are in a mandatory quiet period with respect to each of these submissions, I must limit the scope of my comments. That said I will repeat that we have spent a significant amount of time improving our proposal development process ahead of these submissions. We have given our local plan substantially more responsibility, an edit authority to ensure that we capture as many state specific nuances as possible. We also brought in external resources to mock score, review and otherwise provide an independent assessment of each response before submission. I will also note that the senior executive team, myself included has been deeply engaged in each of these bids submissions. I would now like to say a quick word about the Puerto Rico RFP. Puerto Rico is making a number of changes to its Medicaid program. They are moving from a regional managed care model with only one plan in each region to an island wide model with multiple plans competing against each other. Additionally, the Commonwealth is moving from regional to island wide rates and has expressed its intent to change the profit modifier process to potentially include a minimum MLR. These changes require intense scrutiny on our part. For now, we are pursuing the reprocurement and we will continue to evaluate our position as information about the rating structure becomes more clear. In Florida, the state notified us last week that we were not awarded a contract in Region 11, the only region in which we were invited to negotiate. While we are somewhat disappointed with this outcome, it does not alter our course and we will continue to pursue a major retrenchment in Florida. However, we are still evaluating our options for participating in the marketplace, which has shown signs of improvement while we continue to protest the Medicaid awards. In New Mexico, while we continue to pursue our protest rights, we remain focused on managing our 2018 operations. Without a decision to reverse the award, our New Mexico Medicaid business is in runoff and we will soon determine what our future instate profile will be. I turn now to our revised guidance. As you will recall from February, the 2018 guidance we presented was preliminary. This was due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding the achievement and timing of our profit improvement initiatives conservative views of our 2017 medical cost baseline and 2018 trends and caution about the ultimate performance of our marketplace business. Although some element of uncertainty remains, we have raised our full year 2018 guidance for earnings per diluted share to a range of $4 to $4.50 due to the insights we have gained over the past three months. Simply stated here is our reasoning. The midpoint of our preliminary guidance range was $3.25, first quarter non-recurring benefits now in our actual results were $0.38 per share and we outperformed our own first quarter expectation and expect to continue to outperform the remainder of the year by a total of $0.60 to $0.65 per share. All of this supports, our revised guidance range of $4 to $4.5 with a midpoint of $4.25. While this level of revision may seem modest, we have good reason to remain cautious. Let me highlight a few of the factors that inform our measured approach to guidance. First, we must ensure that favorable medical cost trend performance in the quarter is the result of our actions and not merely a product of random variability. Second, we are mindful that our marketplace results while favorable still rely on managing the higher utilization months in the back half of the year. Third, in prior years, we haven't been accurate with our marketplace estimates of risk adjusted revenue and we want to observe emerging experience to support our forecast. Fourth, the full effect if any of favorable prior year development of claims reserves on our 2018 results will be determined only with the passage of time. Fifth and finally, Florida and New Mexico are challenging environments as the teams are working hard to turn a reasonable profit while managing plans that are technically in partial runoff. For all of these reasons, we believe that the revised guidance is appropriately calibrated. Our second quarter results will be key to validating the sustainability of our improved first quarter results. I will conclude by saying we are increasingly optimistic that our profit improvement initiatives are taking hold and that our medical cost trends in 2018 will be better than we anticipated in our conservative preliminary guidance. However, we still have a long way to go and we remain eternally vigilant. All of that said, we believe we have taken promising first steps toward our profit improvement goals. I look forward to sharing the details of our longer term margin recovery and sustainability plans during our Investor Day on May 301 in New York. There we intend to give you a detailed view of which profit levers we will pull, in which products, in which geographies and by whom with great specificity and detail. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe White for more detail on the financials.
Joe White: Thank you, Joe and hello everyone. Today we reported earnings per diluted share of $1.64 and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.71. As Joe mentioned these results reflect a good first step toward our goal of sustainable margin recovery. I will briefly discuss the items we called out in the earnings release, prior year development of our claims reserves, our March 31 balance sheet and our revised guidance before we open up the call to take questions. We have highlighted three significant items in today's release that were not included in the preliminary guidance we shared with you in February. First, we recognize the benefit of approximately $70 million or $0.83 per diluted share and reduced medical expense related to 2017 when the Federal Government confirmed that the reconciliation of 2017 marketplace CSR is up to-date will be performed on an annual basis. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we had assumed a nine month reconciliation of this item pending confirmation from CMS. Second, we recorded a $10 million charge for the retirement of an additional $97 million of face value of our 2044 convertible notes. This action had the double benefit of strengthening our balance sheet, while also reducing the volatility in our earnings caused by the optionality of convertible debt. As part of this transaction, we issued 1.8 million shares of common stock. On a time weighted basis, these additional 1.8 million shares added 0.5 million to average shares outstanding for the quarter and a 1.4 million to average shares outstanding for the full year when calculating our revised full year 2018 guidance. Third, we recorded $25 million in restructuring charges in the quarter, these charges primarily related to the write-down of capitalized costs for an in-flight software implementation that did not meet our needs. Let me now spend a few minutes discussing prior year development of our claims reserves. As you can see from the roll forward table in today's release, we have had about $240 million of favorable prior year development this quarter. This favorable claims development is the expected result of the more conservative approach we took to the estimation of reserves during the second half of 2017. We have attempted to include the same level of caution and conservatism in our first quarter balance sheet as we did in our year end balance sheet. We have done this through the application of a consistent reserving methodology in both periods. Days in claims payable are down one-day sequentially and are up eight days from the first quarter of 2017. While days and claims payable are a gauge rather than a measure of reserve adequacy the slight movement in this metric quarter-over-quarter supports the view that prior year claims development did not have a significant impact on first quarter earnings. Nevertheless, we will not be able to fully determine the impact if any of prior year development on our first quarter results for some time. This is one of the reasons why we are taking a cautious view in our revised guidance. Turning to our capital structure and balance sheet, we have continued to take advantage of the opportunities to delever the company. In March, we issued common shares in exchange for $97 million in principal of our 2044 convertible notes. This transaction further reduced our debt profile while also allowing us to release another $94 million of restricted cash on the balance sheet. With this transaction the outstanding amount of our 2044 notes has been reduced to approximately $65 million. As of March 31, 2018, the company had unrestrictive cash and investments in excess of $700 million to the parent. This amount provides us with an appropriate amount of capital to manage possible redemptions of our $550 million of 2020 convertible notes. As of March 31, 2018, our health plans had aggregate statutory capital in surplus of approximately $1.9 billion compared with the required minimum level of approximately $1.2 billion. While we would have preferred to have been awarded new Florida and New Mexico Medicaid contracts those two health plans hold in excess of $380 million of statutory capital should current RFP results stand, we expect that we will be able to dividend at least a portion of those funds back to the parent company as soon as the first quarter of 2019. Overall, we are optimistic that the operational improvements we are seeing at our health plans will allow us to establish regular and predictable dividend flows from our subsidiaries to the parent company. We will be discussing more details of our capital plan during our upcoming Investor Day. Finally, some additional thoughts in our revised guidance. Our first quarter performance exceeded expectations even after removing the impact of the 2017 CSR benefit recorded in the quarter. We have increased our full year 2018 guidance to a range of $4 to $4.50 per diluted share. Some important points relating to our revised guidance are as follows; our revised guidance assumes no material impact from prior period development. Our revised guidance includes the net benefit of $0.38 per diluted share from the 2017 CSR reconciliation benefit, restructuring charges and loss on debt extinguishment that we discussed earlier. These items were not included in our original preliminary guidance for 2018. Revised guidance does not include any restructuring or employee separation charges that we may incur in the last three quarters of the year. The effective tax rate in our revised guidance is based upon the Federal statutory rate of 21% adjusted for state taxes and the impact of non-deductible items such as the health insurer fee and portions of our executive compensation. Diluted shares used in calculating revised guidance are 68 million shares. This share count includes the effect of our recent equity of our convertible debt exchange and assumes an average share price of $100 for the period April 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018. We have maintained an appropriate amount of conservatism as we constructed our revised guidance for the remainder of the year and the second quarter will be key to validating the sustainability of our improved first quarter results. Finally, we will be providing additional detail about our margin recovery and sustainability plan on May 31 in New York City. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Josh Raskin: Hi. Thanks. Good morning guys. Just wanted to talk about Florida, New Mexico briefly from a balance sheet perspective. And I don't know if you guys have specific goodwill totals associated with those plans and maybe help us with the timing of when a write-off would come, is that after all of the appeals are done or is that kind of done now. And I guess part of that is, what's the expected sort of debt-to-cap what do you think your leverage looks like post those changes? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Josh, its Joe. We rewrote the goodwill associated with Florida and New Mexico off when it was announced we lost the contracts in the fourth quarter of last year. So there would be no additional goodwill or intangible write offs in those particular markets. Obviously, with nearly $400 million of capital as the reserves run-off and the premium flow stop we'll approach each of the state regulators with the dividend plan, to dividend that cash to the parent company to provide excess capital which is used to retire debt should have a meaningful impact on our leverage ratio next year. So, obviously disappointed, we lost the contracts but additional capital will be released from those entities.
Josh Raskin: Nice. That's a positive. And then, the Texas reprocurement could you just walk us through the timing in terms of award dates and contract dates? And then, what's Molina's current run rate in terms of revenues on that business?
Joe Zubretsky: The Texas Starplus program bid was submitted. Awards will be announced in October of 2018, with a January 2019 inception date to the contract. Bear in mind, we are only in six regions in Texas and we are bidding on all 13, so we actually view this as a potential revenue upside for us. Any comments on the tactics…
Josh Raskin: The question I got Joe was just the -- I just wanted to know what the -- on the Starplus portion of that in Texas, what's the total revenues that you guys are -- at the run rate today?
Joe Zubretsky: It's approximately $1.5 billion.
Josh Raskin: Got you. And then, just last quick one on the flu, I know you said the $18 million was that relative to prior year or relative to guidance?
Joe Zubretsky: Both. We expected a normal flu season which averages between $15 million and $20 million and it came $18 million higher which is about 40 basis points in the MLR for the quarter.
Josh Raskin: Thanks. Perfect. All helpful. Thanks Joe.
Joe Zubretsky: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Justin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. First question is on the marketplace. Can you talk to us about what the updated margins assumed in your new guidance for the marketplace for the full year? And then, any early thoughts on your marketplace footprint for 2019?
Joe Zubretsky: On the marketplace results Justin, we're still taking a very cautious view of the balance of the year. We beat our expectations in the first quarter with a 67% adjusted, MLR adjusted for the CSR benefits, 800 basis point improvement over last year. Obviously, the result of nearly 60% price increases we put into the marketplace. And as we said, we will confirm that those prices perhaps will be uncompetitive, but they weren't. And we beat our membership forecast by 50,000 members. We now have 450,000 members and a significant portion of that beat was in Texas, our most profitable state. The reason for the cautious approach is utilization is very back ended into the last three quarters of the year as each quarter progresses, you have special enrollment members utilizing enrollment generally is of healthier members during the year. And of course benefit design out of pockets and out of pocket maxs and copays obviously have an impact on the back half of the year. But, we want to make sure that we have our seasonality projection correct. And we also want to make sure that our estimates of risk adjusted revenue are accurate. As you know, we haven't been as accurate as we needed to be in prior years. We think we have a better methodology now, but we have not included a lot of outperformance in the back half of the year for marketplace.
Justin Lake: Okay. So is there margin I think you said 4.6 was what you expected for the full year on your bids, but you were only in your guidance were flat to maybe a slightly positive margin. I'm just trying to figure out where on that -- cycle are you?
Joe Zubretsky: You recall when we did our preliminary guidance when we announced our fourth quarter. We said that the marketplace had a low single-digit loss last year. And in our guidance, we reversed the loss and basically forecasted a breakeven result even though we price to a 4.6% target margin. And what I would say in our revised guidance is the first quarter beat in the market place is in our guidance, but certainly not a lot of improvement in the back half of the year. So we want to wait and see the second quarter before we get a really robust forecast of what the marketplace is likely to produce this year. But the target is still 4.6% on gross revenue.
Justin Lake: And then, any early thoughts on marketplace footprint for 2019? Thanks.
Joe Zubretsky: Yes. We are obviously in the process of developing our preliminary rate bids which as go in early June. We have decisions to make in Florida and New Mexico, if we lose our Medicaid contracts marketplace will be the only substantial business we have in those markets. Florida is seeing improvement this year and New Mexico is doing really well. It is possible, we would resubmit rates in Utah and Wisconsin. And certainly, the other states are performing well so there's no reason to believe that we wouldn't still be successful in our other states such as Washington, Ohio, in Michigan and California.
Justin Lake: Great. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Zach Sopcak of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Zach Sopcak: Thanks for the question and congrats on the quarter. I want to circle back on the comments in Washington state. It sounded like it was within the expected variability. Just wanted to understand a little bit more what happened in the quarter those related at all to some of the expansion you had into the north central region starting this year. And if that's something that could occur in other states similarly as we progress through the year?
Joe Zubretsky: It really wasn't related to the two regions that we procured. In the fourth quarter of 2017. We began to see the emergence of high acuity inpatient cases. We thought we had captured it in our reserves, but early in 2018, we saw some negative development in Washington related to high acuity inpatient. That trend continued for the first quarter date of service. I will tell you that inpatient cases are over $50,000 in total cost. The reported number of those cases increased by over 65% in the quarter. And I also think we dropped our guard a little bit on some of our utilization controls. In those cases hit the stop-loss threshold and revert to build charges you need intense concurrent review procedures and the resources to make sure that you're paying appropriate amounts. And I would say that our concurrent review resources in Washington will not keep pace with the additional volume. So we of course corrected that and we project Washington to have better performance in each of the next three quarters than we had in the first, but probably not back to our full year annual expectation.
Zach Sopcak: Hey, guys. That's helpful. Thanks. And then, as you've brought in outside consultants to help with your RFP process. Can you contrast it all where you are now in that process as you look forward versus maybe when you were on the last quarter call and it sounded like you're just recently started engaging them?
Joe Zubretsky: Well, I think the way I would characterize the entire process has been reengineered not just with external resources, but now that we have new leadership of our health plan operations bringing more local knowledge and subject matter expertise there and writing the proposals. It's just a better and more robust process that it will get better with time. So it's been reengineered from the bottoms up and we have a high degree of confidence that our Texas, Washington and Puerto Rico bid submissions were written in a high quality manner very responsive what the state wanted to hear about our capabilities and service profile.
Zach Sopcak: Hey, great. Thanks for the questions.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ana Gupte of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
Ana Gupte: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. The first one is on the guidance and it sounds like it feels like you've put the entire workforce reduction run rate in there in part on the marketplace and Medicaid and potentially not much else on the PBM. And you're at about 35 basis points you raised your net margin guidance. Wanted to get a sense for -- do you think assuming everything goes okay on the upside, will you get to your original target margins, net margins of 1.5 to 2 potentially this year and then you can you talk about the trajectory in 2019. And is there any upside there as well with any of additional levers?
Joe Zubretsky: The way we think about it is, if you just ignore the $0.38 which are onetime operating items that we raised our guidance by $0.60 to $0.65 and we view that as a $0.40 [beat] [ph] on the first quarter. And $0.20, $0.25 raise on the rest for the year. That's just a cautious approach we're taking not only on marketplace, but across all our business lines, we want to see another quarter of positive experience emerge. As you know our previous guidance on net margin basis was 1.1 to 1.3. That's now 1.3 to 1.5 adjusted for the CSR. And if that's the starting point for a trajectory marching toward our 2% after tax a goal, we think that's a great starting point. And we'll talk more at Investor Day about what profit levers will pull to make up the rest of the way. So, if we can hit it, it's a great starting place. Keep in mind that this is the year where we got the benefit of a tax rate decrease and premium rates were already set. So there could be some "tax windfall" in our current profitability and we're mindful of that. But, if we could hit that net after tax margin included in our guidance great starting place to get to our ultimate goal of 2%.
Ana Gupte: Okay, great. Thanks. On the risk adjusted, I noticed you had raised your payable estimate a little over $200 million from the fourth quarter and is that contemplate any third party data with weekly, you said you have a new methodology. And is that assuming the 350,000-ish that you have now on marketplace membership and do you feel it's adequately conservative.
Joe Zubretsky: Joe, you pick up.
Joe White: Sure. Its Joe White speaking. We have the -- we continue to refine our procedures for estimating risk adjustment liability. We have the same basic processes, we've always had we've had our internal estimates. We have third party estimates and we merged those two to develop an estimated at any given point in time. But I think it's fair to say we are being more conservative. This goes back to last year when given our experience with this, we thought it was appropriate to take a more conservative approach. So as you can see the balance has increased a bit this year that's a combination of just taking a conservative approach to 2018 and a little bit of adjustment in 2017. So we feel confident in the numbers right now.
Ana Gupte: Maybe one final one, on Florida with Region 11, you had the ITN, was this something partly driven even by you and that you didn't want to incur any more runoff G&A and the state reduced the rates as well or was something else that came up during the negotiation process that caused you to not…
Joe Zubretsky: First of all, we don't actually know yet why we were not awarded a contract in Region 11. We will potentially learn the reasons, but we don't know yet. But no, in full transparency, we went in attempting to secure the region whether it be the service profile and rates. And we were not awarded the contract. So as we learn more, I will certainly communicate that. And as I said, we're pursuing all avenues available to us to a) learn, why you weren’t selected and b) is there anything we can do to reverse the decision?
Ana Gupte: Got it. Thanks for the color.
Joe Zubretsky: Welcome.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Sarah James of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Sarah James: Thank you and congratulations on a great quarter. You've mentioned a few times today that there are multiple points of conservatism in your guidance. You've flagged specifically development in tax, so just wanted to make sure, if there are any other points that you feel you're being conservative as you view guidance now. And then, can you frame up the potential tax windfall for us. I know that the tax rate is variable, but maybe you can help us with the framework around the scale of variability there?
Joe Zubretsky: Well, on the tax windfall for lack of a better term when we gave preliminary guidance assume all other things being equal, I believe is about 40 basis point; 40 basis points from the margin. And that doesn't mean that it will or will not be considered as we said future rates. But I just wanted to remind everybody that the rates -- premium rates were set before the tax regime changed. We're just being cautious and conservative across the book of business particularly on marketplace. I wouldn't cite any one reason -- any one product or any one geography. We had some outperformance this quarter, our [outperformance] [ph] doing well. But, we did not project a sustainability of outperformance throughout the rest of the year. Again just being cautious and conservative given the company's past track record of missing estimates and not forecasting properly. But I think with a really good second quarter data point, we should be able to give revised guidance at the end of the second quarter that hopefully is reflective of what we are [Technical Difficulty] full year rate.
Sarah James: Great. You talked about hitting margin target through achieving medical management with an eye on SG&A cost maybe using external vendors or rent to buy strategy. Then, today you announced the termination of utilization and care management project. So I'm wondering is that the start of outsourcing some of this analytics work and can you provide any details on to what the alternative plan is for the -- start new project.
Joe Zubretsky: Sure. First thing, I would mention is that the technology platform that was in-flight in our view was misaligned with our goals and objectives. It was implemented to produce administrative efficiency, but did not focus on clinical efficacy, UM, CM and DM. And so we want a business process and our technology platform to be squarely focused on managing our members to high quality care while producing a competitive MLR. And if it happens to save a few bucks of SG&A all the better. But we've got the platform that was being implemented with misaligned with that primary objective. Now we're not going to outsource core care management that is proprietary that's a differentiator. Our strategy that's emerging is one of -- who can manage high acuity members better than their competitors. So there might be technology components, there might be business processes that are very administrative that could be outsourced. But the core clinical activities of the company is a differentiator, is proprietary and will remain owned and operated by Molina.
Sarah James: Great. And last detail here, was there any impact of the carve out of California, IHSS in the quarter or that could be reflected in full year guidance?
Joe White: Hi, it's Joe White speaking. The impact of the IHSS carve out in 2018 was already reflected in our preliminary guidance and isn't particularly substantial anyway.
Sarah James: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Matt Borsch of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Matt Borsch: Sorry. Yes, thank you. Could you just a question on Texas and the market place in particular, I just noticed you cited the Texas market particularly for improvement and yet there's also a market where your enrollment expanded where it dropped very significantly in some others. So I'm just trying to understand is that, it looks little contrary to what I might have expected. What is it about the Texas situation that's different?
Joe Zubretsky: I think Texas, Matt is simply a combination of two things. One, a very good and highly leveraged provider network and a stable risk pool. You have a combination of those two factors and you can actually make your target margins in this business with a great deal of predictability. And Texas has been the outstanding performer in the marketplace since we launched this business a few years ago and continues to be. So with 245,000 members up from 196,000, 197,000 last year, it's adding meaningfully to our earnings profile.
Matt Borsch: Great. And also if I can just confirm, I think you had suggested that both Florida and New Mexico pretty sure New Mexico are running net unprofitable, is that correct?
Joe Zubretsky: Are you referring to the marketplace, Matt?
Matt Borsch: Oh, I'm sorry Joe. I was referring to overall.
Joe Zubretsky: Overall? New Mexico struggled on Medicaid due to higher behavioral costs, but did well in the marketplace. Florida did as expected as you know it was in our list of turnaround plans and it performed better in the first quarter than prior year and in line with our expectations and the marketplace did show signs of improvement in Florida.
Matt Borsch: And Joe if I may on both Florida and New Mexico, as you've done maybe some postmortem on the contract losses there. Do you see a common thread that you can point to or do you think they are truly one offs?
Joe Zubretsky: I think there are much different situations. In New Mexico, we scored highly on technical competence service profile and all the technical components of the proposal that we lost on rates. We made a calculated judgment at the time that we did in the top quartile range -- the range of rates that was offered and still win. And that wasn't true. We have to bid at the medium, your rate taker in this business, not a rate maker and yet the profitability stresses of the company at the time it took a very conservative approach to bidding on rates. I come at it from a different point of view that you need to build medium and then figure out how you are going to make your cost structure work to squeeze out of your 2% after tax margin. In Florida -- being a Monday morning quarterback and having the benefit of hindsight. It was a not a well written proposal that wasn't responsive to the state's needs. And we did have some service issues in Florida caused by the incredible growth of the marketplace that sort of tainted our operating excellence in Medicaid costs and service issues. So I think that of the two quite different reasons. They are quite specific to those situations and certainly not the case with Texas and Washington which are two very well performing health plans in great businesses run by great teams.
Matt Borsch: Joe, thank you very much and thanks to you and the team for the quarter and also all of this visibility on business.
Joe Zubretsky: You are welcome. Thank you, Matt.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Gary Taylor of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Gary Taylor: Hi, good morning. Just a couple of questions. One just looking at the California revenue run rate, is that just going back to the in-home support services, is that 100 million plus revenue drop just passed through and that's why the revenue is down, but the MLR is fine.
Joe White: It's a combination. Its Joe speaking. Hi, Gary. It's a combination of that along with the fact we took a pretty substantial Medicaid expansion cut, I think in the neighborhood of 10% effective 71 last year. So it's those two factors.
Gary Taylor: Okay. And then that's great. That goes to my next question, when we look at the Medicaid expansion revenue is down about 8% versus enrollment down 3%, you took that cut in July, but the per member per month for Medicaid expansion were kind of flat to down slightly 3Q, 4Q now suddenly they are down a fair amount? It looks more like something happened in the first quarter or is there some nuance to that?
Joe White: Not that I'm aware of that Gary. We'll have to go back and look at that. Again that we don't see the major cut was for Medicaid expansion in California was in July. So essentially if you have some of what you're talking about essentially a mix issue among the states.
Gary Taylor: Okay. And then, last question just getting to guidance. Why include the net non-recurring items in guidance particularly if it sounds like there is potentially some severance cost in the back half of the year, why not just guide an operating number excluding the CSRs and the severance, so the guidance doesn't get impacted in the second half, if there's some additional severance cost?
Joe Zubretsky: Gary, really is just a stylistic question, we debated whether to leave it out of everything or putting in everything. We chose the latter. Certainly, we could have done that. But I would say that around the edges there will be restructuring continuing as you suggested. We continued to chip away at our administrative infrastructure. Keep in mind that as we unwind our operations in Florida, in New Mexico, there could be and there will be perhaps some severance costs, perhaps some lease write offs as we downsize those operations. We would prefer to transfer that infrastructure to one of the incumbents or one of the winners. We'll certainly try to do that, but there will be some restructuring probably whether we are due to those contracts. But including it was stylistic if anything -- is that responsive to your question?
Gary Taylor: Do you have an Investor Day where will we have some additional visibility and magnitude of what some of those restructuring costs might be. I think generally the street would exclude those, but in this context they would obviously impact the guidance. So can you or will you give us some more insight into the magnitude of those?
Joe Zubretsky: Yes. We have already started our unwinding plans. We certainly know the magnitude in ranges around what the potential these write offs, potential severance costs are. We will clearly update you at Investor Day on that.
Gary Taylor: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Steve Tanal of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Steve Tanal: Thanks guys. Good morning. And just one thing on the MLRs, if we sort of X out or just look at an ex-PPD and MCSRs, it looks like MCR would have been up about 160 bps year-on-year about 40 of that from flu, it's ex-flu about -- up 120. Just sort of curious how you'd frame the conservatism you spoke to with respect to that number versus the core business and how we should think about that?
Joe Zubretsky: I think the first thing, we have to do is parse the [indiscernible] development that Joe White and I talk about this often. So the $240 million number is certainly sizable and noticeable. Bear in mind that approximately $150 million of that is the explicit margin, we rolled into our reserves that due to the way it's accounted for in our disclosures always rolls off into the prior year and is then reinstated. So it's pretty much a wash. Therefore, you're really looking at $90 million of what I call actuarial base run-off in the quarter. We fully intended and our actual techniques to reinstate that level of conservatism in the first quarter date of service January, February and March reserves. And so, we believe that the P&L impact of reserve run-off in the quarter was negligible to minimal. If there was any impact, it's likely to be in the marketplace business because we are ultra conservative on setting those reserves at year end for a variety of reasons including our pricing repositioning. But our view is that we reinstated that level of conservatism into first quarter reserves and therefore the impact on the MLR in the quarter was negligible. And certainly the other puts and takes are our flu and some of the other smaller items. But I think the MCR except for that fact is actually pretty reflective of our performance in the quarter.
Steve Tanal: Okay. Fair enough. And just a quick follow-up on guidance, the non-marketplace enrollment reduction of 64,000, what is behind that number, that's not Region 11, right which would take effect in 2019?
Joe Zubretsky: Joe?
Joe White: I know it's not Region 11. There's a -- that will be more or less consistent through the year. Couple of things are happening. One thing it'd been New Mexico where the loss of the contract there we're going to see an enrollment, an assignment for it beginning in the first quarter. We're also -- fourth quarter, I'm sorry, beginning in the fourth quarter of this year. We're also seeing a little bit of pressure in different states as a result of recertification and lower enrollment. So it's nothing dramatic, but there is a little bit of enrollment pressure. And as a practical matter we may see some loss of enrollment in Florida beginning in the fourth quarter just like we did in New Mexico.
Steve Tanal: Got it. Thanks. Just lastly, out of Florida, what should we expect kind of closure on this the appeals and such you guys have a sense of that?
Joe Zubretsky: I'm sorry, can you repeat that, we couldn't hear the first part of your question.
Steve Tanal: Sorry about that guys. I was saying give a sense when you think you get closure on Florida, at this stage it sounds like the appeal is ongoing?
Joe Zubretsky: It's a process that you go through. It will be resolved soon. And as I said before right now we are considering these contracts plus we are pursuing all of the avenues available to us but we are contemplating the unwinding of our Medicaid operations each day. But also focusing on whether we should stay in the marketplace in each state. But, the process goes through a very as you know winding and arduous process of meetings and filings and those types of things, which we don't -- can't talk about. But it will evolve here over the next few weeks, it will resolve by Investor Day, we certainly will report to you on the outcome.
Steve Tanal: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Kevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. Wanted to go back to the tax reform comments that you made sustainability when you mentioned the 40 basis points to margins from taxes, was that an overall benefit to the business in 2018 or is that a comment that that's kind of what potentially that risk because you look at just the exchange in the Medicare business and potentially seeing pricing pressure on that into next year?
Joe White: Hi, Kevin. Its Joe White speaking. That's just basically an arithmetic calculation of moving from a 35% effective tax rate to 21% that 40% drop in tax rate would move up 1.5% after tax returns in the neighborhood of 1.8% and 2% to the neighborhood of 2.4%. So that just that would apply to anybody measuring the tax benefit on an after tax basis, is purely arithmetic going from 35% to 21%.
Kevin Fischbeck: Okay. So I guess is there a way for you to kind of quantify what you think that tax [Technical Difficulty] 2019 might be. I guess it's not clear 100% to me what you're assuming as far as 2018 benefit that gets maybe recouped by the states this year. Any color on that? Unlike what you think tax adjusted normalization and if they have got long term tax rates for you and it will get recouped by the states or not, repriced away or not where you think your run rate earnings are this year that we can kind of -- if you don’t have a headwind that we're trying to fight against next year we understand what's the base number is this year?
Joe Zubretsky: Well, you have the right question, the question that needs to be answered that is, what's the rate setting process going to take into consideration going forward? And as you know we are rate takers in this business, taxes are not as explicitly cited in rate reconciliations but they could be taken into consideration as states are projecting either what they're allowing for medical cost trend or [Technical Difficulty]. Now that the 21% tax rate is in the run rate of the business, I think we can stop talking about it and talk about rate adequacy going forward. And we'll certainly give you a view of what potential stresses there are from rate adequacy going forward as we talk about our future on Investor Day and how much of that we can erode through profit improvement initiatives. As our MCRs, as you can see by our disclosure are still running much higher than our competitors. So there's plenty of room for opportunity.
Kevin Fischbeck: Okay. And then last question. It looks like you took down the Medicaid enrollment a little bit, you took up the exchange enrollment a little bit. How much of the MLR improvement is because of that mix shift into 70% MLR versus 90% of our business?
Joe White: Hi. Its Joe White speaking. I think very little of that. That's all on the margins. Not going to have a huge…
Kevin Fischbeck: Fine. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jason Twizell of MUFG Securities. Please go ahead.
Jason Twizell: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just quickly around capital deployment given your improved outlook for EBITDA this year. And then also the dividending in capital associated with Florida and New Mexico to the parent in early 2019 is the expectation of whom to use it for debt reduction or is there a potential, do we looking at new markets or M&A or share buybacks?
Joe Zubretsky: Jason the first thing you have to do is move toward a balance sheet that a managed care company ought to have. Obviously, the optionality in the balance sheet due to the converts need to be reckoned with. We took care of the 2024, 2020 is still out there. And so we'd have to deserve a cash position to "funded demand" for those notes should they be presented. Are part of our revolver still outstanding? So we could repay that and have some interest expense left. So yes the first thing to do is to sort of correct the balance sheet, the optionality in the capital structure. Delever get it down into a comfort zone of 50% to 55% percent initially, but that's we have earmarked for the cash generation initially. Before we start contemplating M&A or share buybacks or any of those other capital deployment techniques that once we hit steady state and start growing again we certainly would contemplate.
Jason Twizell: All right. Appreciate the color. That was my only question.
Operator: And our next question today comes from [indiscernible] of Baird. Please go ahead. Hello, Mr. [indiscernible], your line is open. It appears we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.
Ryan Kubota: Thank you all for joining us today. And we appreciate the time.

Joseph Zubretsky: Thank you, Ryan, and thank you all for joining us this morning. This quarter's results reflect a significant transition we are undertaking here at Molina. The disappointing contract losses in New Mexico and Florida, and the related goodwill impairment charges, the continued expenses for restructuring and the cash up adjustments related to the poor performing marketplace business are all legacy issues that we believe are now behind us. The performance of the core business however, which we define as a Medicaid and Medicare was respectable and when viewed on a run rate and full year basis provide a solid baseline from which to achieve our margin recovery and sustainability plan. We are squarely focused on improving our operating margins and creating an earnings profile that is less volatile and more sustainable. Only when we have accomplished this, we'll be able to reap the full benefits of this franchise, with its strong revenue base, across well diversified geographies and product lines. This morning, I will be discussing the sustainability of our revenue base, the key operating and financial results from the fourth quarter and the full-year and connecting them to our 2018 preliminary guidance, and to the vision that I provided at a presentation to investors last month. First, with respect to the disappointing news related to the re-procurement of our Florida Medicaid contract, we are taking urgent and focused actions to secure this revenue base. Today, we operate in 8 of 11 regions throughout Florida, serving approximately 350,000 Medicaid members, with $1.5 billion of annualized revenue. The entire state is currently up for re-procurement, effective January 1, 2019. As we announced last week, we have been selected to negotiate to the award of a managed care contract in only one region of the state, that region, Region 11 comprises Miami-Dade at Monroe County, where we currently serve 59,000 Medicaid members. This outcome posted significant challenges, as a first step, we will do our best to secure contract at Region 11. Beyond that we will pursue the various protested appeals as appropriate. In New Mexico, we were surprised last month that the state chose not to invite us into the next round of the re-procurement process. Our New Mexico health plan has a long history of offering high quality service to our members. Upon review of the procurement materials made available, we have concluded that our re-procurement loss was primarily based on the rating factor in the bid and not the service aspect of the bid. With that back in mind, we are currently working to the appeals process in an effort to retain this business. That said, if the current decisions regarding our Medicaid participation in either Florida or New Mexico stand, they would have a significant negative impact to the company's revenue. Although our Florida and New Mexico health plans have been unprofitable in 2017, to say that their loss is therefore not challenging, would ignore the more significant issue. The lost opportunity of returning those health plans to profitability is of serious concern. Our plan with respect to Florida and New Mexico is as follows. First, it is critical that we manage our 2018 operations in both states to achieve our 2018 plan. We will launch the appropriate protested appeals necessary to ensure that we have exhausted every avenue available to us for retaining these contracts. If the outcome of these RFPs proves to be unsuccessful, we will transition our operations in an orderly fashion and in a financially responsible way and then we will adjust our cost structure accordingly to mitigate any percentage margin impact on the consolidated enterprise. The long-term headwind therefore is not against our target margin percentage, but against the absolute value of operating profit we can achieve. We are particularly sensitive to this situation, as we prepare for two other near terms re-procurements, Texas and Washington where we will compete vigorously to win. We have always taken major steps to improve our RFP response process to better articulate and present the Molina value proposition. First, we have marshaled more internal and external resources to support both efforts. We have engaged a broader and deeper array of very senior subject matter experts, clinical, operational, regulatory and financials. We have infused more local market knowledge into the process and we have retained outside experts in Medicaid procurement to pre-score our proposals and conduct marked reviews. While this may sound like we are blocking and tackling, it is precisely these technical qualities that are the foundation for successful bid. The combination of a well-executed proposal leverage with our deep community ties and long history of quality servicing in these states and our two recent wins in Washington give us confidence in successful outcomes. Now turning back to our earnings, we reported a net loss for the quarter of $4.59 per diluted share and $9.07 for the full year. Looking more deeply into these unacceptable headline numbers, I would like to call out three important dimensions of our fourth quarter and full year performance. First, we incurred $342 million for the quarter and $704 million for the full year of impairment and restructuring cost. Second, we experienced poor marketplace performance as demonstrated by a quarterly medical care ratio of 102.1% for the fourth quarter and 88.1% for the full year. Our product that should run at 78% or below based on 2017 pricing. Finally, looking over the entire year and stripping away a number of legacy items, we were able to develop a clear view of the underlying earnings base of our core business. I would characterize that underlying earnings base as stable. Allow me to spend a little more time in each of these dimensions. First, the impairment charges were the result of the unfortunate combination of expensive legacy acquisitions giving rise to significant intangible assets and the unsuccessful re-procurements relating to those same geographies. Relatedly, the restructuring charges were the result of the company growing its cost structure beyond its profit capability and this lack of discipline has now been corrected with improved monitoring and control. Second, with respect to the marketplace, we have taken significant actions to improve performance in 2018, as well as to reduce our overall exposure to this business. Specifically, we had implemented premium increases averaging 59% effective January 1, 2018. Those premium increases included a 20% increase for the absence of federal funding of CSR subsidies and a further 39% increase for medical cost trend anti-selection risk, demographics and a variety of other rating factors. These price increases along with our market exists in Utah and Wisconsin have resulted in substantially lower membership. So in response to our marketplace challenges, we have increased premium rate significantly, eliminated our exposure to uncertainties around CSR funding and reconciliation and priced up with the full expectation we will reduce our overall membership. Finally, the fourth quarter performance in our core business was respectable. Our medical care ratio excluding marketplace, declined 210 basis points to 88.8% when compared to the third quarter of 2017, reflecting decrease inpatient utilization as compared to the third quarter. This improvement was achieved despite an increase in flu related cost estimated to be $20 million. Looking at 2017 on a full year basis, it is important to remember that our medical care ratio of 90.6% is burdened by substantial unfavorable out of period or nonrecurring items. These include approximately $150 million of unfavorable prior period claims development and another $90 million of unfavorable marketplace items, most notably the lack of CSR reimbursement in the fourth quarter. Absent these items, our medical care ratio for 2017 would have been approximately 89.3%. In that context, I would like to provide some commentary on our core business portfolio. Looking at our core business by product line for the full year 2017, TANF represented approximately 40% of our total Medicaid revenue and had a medical care ratio of 92%, which was above our 2017 target of approximately 90%. Improving profitability for this product will require more effective utilization controls and care management, particularly with respect to High-Risk Pregnancy, reducing unit costs of high cost providers and more effective rate efficacy. Our Aged, Blind and Disabled product represents approximately 37% of our total Medicaid revenue, and had a medical care ratio of 94.7% for the full year. As oppose to our 2017 target of approximately 91%. Keys to improving ABD performance include, improved care management in coordination of services for high acuity populations focusing on the integration of behavioral and physical health services, targeting high risk members for care management intervention and more comprehensive documentation of medical conditions and improved management of community and other long-term care services for members in this product line. Expansion represented 23% of our total Medicaid revenue and at a medical care ratio of 84.9%, which was above our 2017 target of approximately 83%. Expansion continues to contribute favorably to our overall profitability and was responsible for approximately 40% of our total Medicaid medical margin for 2017. While premiums and margins for expansion have been declining in recent years, the rating environment appears to have stabilized. States generally look at rate adequacy holistically across all of Medicaid. Strategically this product may be an important companion product to our marketplace business as certain states contemplate merging the two markets. In 2017, Medicare and MMP combined generated approximately $2 billion of revenue, and had a medical care ratio of 88.4%, which was below our 2017 target of approximately 92%. These products are important because they present opportunities for the integration of care, on an even more comprehensive basis that is the case with many of our ABD members. The MMD [ph] plans in particular provide the opportunity to demonstrate that all aspects of care behavioral health, physical health, and long-term care services can be delivered more efficiently through managed care. As I presented to investor last month, we have a very well diversified geographic portfolio, the majority of which is already operating at our target margin level, and the minority of which is profitable, but below target and the remainder unprofitable. Moving from a product line our company to a geographic view, I have the following commentary. Of our four largest health plans that generated over $2 billion annually in core business premium revenue, three California, Ohio, and Washington operated at medical care ratios that were at least 200 basis points below our consolidated core medical care ratio of 91%. Texas is the fourth of our health plans with core business revenue over $2 billion has a heavy concentration of members receiving long-term care services, which explain why its core medical care ratio of 92% exceeds the company's overall average. These plans are operating at target margins have long tenured and experience management teams, excellent product diversification mix and excellent standings in the respective states. Although it is midsized I would also include Michigan on this list of well performing plans. Our underperforming plans Florida, New Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Illinois are under intense review for performance improvement, irrespective of their re-procurement status. New Mexico's performance improved in the last half of 2017, and is projected to be the marginally profitable in 2018. Florida's issue largely stem from aggressive marketplace membership growth in 2016 and 2017, that combined with Medicaid challenges over taxed many core operations. With its reduced marketplace profile in 2018, combined with our improvement initiatives already in flight this business should improve. Puerto Rico's performance, and that of the entire Island was impacted by the hurricane as utilization abated dramatically and then bounced back. In the back half of the year performance stabilized, and to note the entire Island will be re-procured this spring. In Illinois we had significant unfavorable prior period development due to a variety of issues. In 2018, with a new state wide contract we will start the year with a slight premium revenue increase. We are working toward rebuilding relationships with the providers in the central part of the state, as we reenter those areas at the beginning of the year. Our fourth quarter SG&A ratio of 7.4% represented a 20 basis point decline from the third quarter, and was 60 basis points lower than the full year ratio of 8%. This improvement reflects the actions taken in 2017. The tighter controls in productivity standards that we've implemented will ensure that our costs stay in line with our revenue base. And we expect to continue to find additional savings above the $235 million we have already announced. Moving on to the subject of capital management, enhancing our balance sheet and staying capital disciplined are also key parts of our plan. We took a number of steps in this regards during the fourth quarter. We strengthened our liability for medical claims, marketplace CSR and risk adjustment. In December, we repurchased the portion of our 2044 convertible debt in exchange for equity. This transaction enabled us to lower our total debt to capital ratio by approximately 5 percentage points, while also allowing us to release for general purposes approximately $157 million of restricted cash. Finally, we entered into a bridge loan that will provide funding in the event that our $550 million face value of convertible notes, due in February 2020 are presented to us. While we think it is unlikely that those note will be presented to us in the near future, we concluded that it was important to may gain this risk. Our total debt ratio remains too high, and we will continue to delever and improve our overall capital structure to achieve our target. I turn now to the preliminary 2018 guidance. We describe this guidance as preliminary because of the inherent uncertainty around achievement and timing of our numerous profit improvement initiatives. While these initiatives extend across the various dimensions of managed care fundamentals that I described to investors last month, many are in the early stages of development and implementation, and therefore not included in guidance. Therefore, our guidance should be viewed as preliminary estimate of what we expect to achieve until we see the profit improvement from these in flight initiatives manifest themselves in the earnings stream. Once we have the benefit of first quarter earnings, and further insight into the execution of our profit improvement initiatives, we will be able to update you with the firmer view of our guidance. To provide for an appropriate amount of execution risk, our preliminary guidance has therefore been developed with appropriately conservative views of medical cost baseline in 2017, medical cost trend for 2018, potential rate increases and retained amounts of revenue at risk, and the turnaround of the marketplace business until we can observe the achievement on the margins implicit in our 2018 pricing. With that said, our preliminary guidance is as follows, for 2018 on a preliminary basis, we expect earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $3 to $3.50 on a GAAP basis. We expect premium revenue to decrease from $18.9 billion to approximately $17.5 billion. The vast majority of this decrease is driven by lower marketplace enrollment, which is only partially offset by higher premium rates. Our preliminary guidance anticipates that marketplace membership will begin the year at approximately 450,000 members from 815,000 at December 31st and decline to approximately 300,000 members by the end of 2018. We expect our 2018 medical care ratio to be approximately 89% compared to the 90.6% medical care ratio, we reported for 2017. Although, our preliminary guidance takes a cautious view of the medical cost improvement in 2018, we expect our 2018 performance to benefit from an absence of the unfavorable prior period claim development we experienced in 2017. That unfavorable prior period claim development in 2017 amounted to $150 million. We expect to manage our administrative cost ratio to approximately 7.3% for all of 2018. This reflects the full year run rate value of the $235 million of savings that we announced last month as part of our restricting efforts. We will update you with a firmer view of our 2018 preliminary guidance on our first quarter earnings call and at our Investor Day. I have also spoken about the need to bring additional talent into our company, while we have many talented leaders at Molina the regress demands of our turn around require that we continue to assess our talent needs across the company and expand our leadership team. Mark Caim [ph] our new Executive Vice President of Strategic Planning, Corporate Development and Transformation, will be the chief architect of our continued restructuring and will lead the analysis of the business portfolio and work to unlock value in all of our major vendor and ancillary cost contracts. Mark's years of recent experienced with [indiscernible] where he performed similar activities will surely create a significant amount of value. I would also like to announce the hiring of Pam Sedmak, Executive Vice President of Health Plan Operations. Pam will be responsible for health plan operations, turning around the underperformers, solidifying our re-procurement efforts and executing on margin recovery and sustainability plan across the fundamentals of managed care. Pam has a long and successful career of managed care particularly in her role as President and CEO for Aetna Medicaid where she oversaw 17 health plans, whose Medicaid business achieved over $9.5 billion in premium revenue. Most recently, Pam was a Senior Advisor at McKinsey & Company servicing clients in the healthcare servicing space. In closing, I am excited about 2018, and I look forward to providing more details on our longer term strategic plans during our Investor Day on May 31st in New York. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe White for more detail on the financials.
Joseph White: Thank you, Joe and hello everyone. Yesterday we reported a net loss for the quarter of $4.59 per diluted share, and a net loss of $4.52 per diluted share on an adjusted basis. As Joe mentioned, embedded in these results are several significant items outside of our normal operations that were in further discussions. First we took a $73 million charge as a result of the federal government's decision to stop paying cost sharing reduction rebates or CSRs to health plans beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017. To be clear, we believe we are legally entitled to those payments and will pursue all available means to collect them. We recorded a further charge of $50 million to increase liabilities for marketplace risk adjustment in CSR that related to the first nine months of 2017. Our marketplace premium deficiency reserve was reduced to zero as of December 31, 2017. This was a $70 million benefit in the quarter. We recognized approximately $20 million in incremental flu costs in the quarter. We recognized $269 million of non-cash impairment losses at our Florida, New Mexico and Illinois health plans. The impairments at Florida and New Mexico was a result of our recent contract losses. The Illinois impairment is purely an issue of historical costs. While we are confident that we can improve profitability in Illinois so that it is a meaningful contributor to our company that current profit profile of the health plan does not support the purchase prices paid for certain membership years ago. We recognized approximately $73 million of restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of 2017. In the fourth quarter we also incurred approximately $14 million in expense related to the exchange of equity for $141 million of face value of our 2044 convertible notes. Finally, we recognized approximately $54 million in additional tax expense during the fourth quarter due to the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. It is important to keep the transitory nature of these items in perspective as we continue to evaluate the business, through the lens of the margin recovery and sustainability plan that we announced last month. A full understanding of our underlying business requires that we look beyond the disappointments of our 2017 marketplace performance. The items I outlined a minute ago, and the $150 million of unfavorable prior period development that we experienced in 2017. As Joe noted, we have five large health plans California, Ohio, Washington, Texas and Michigan that are operating at target margins. Additionally, several of the health plans have good prospects for ultimately achieving their target margins. We also saw continued administrative cost improvements in the fourth quarter. The quarter benefited from about $60 million of the annualized administrative cost savings of $235 million that we achieved in 2017. Let me now take a few minutes to discuss our marketplace performance during the quarter. First and keeping with our commitment to resolve legacy issues, we booked a $73 million expense for the termination of CSR reimbursement in the fourth quarter. As I said a moment ago, we believe that we are legally entitled to these federal payments and we will pursue all available means to collect them. We also recorded $50 million of marketplace risk adjustment in CSR expenses related to the first three quarters of 2017, as a result of updated third-party data that we received during the fourth quarter. As a reminder, the estimates we book for risk adjustment are a result of our own member risk scores measured against those of the overall market. The blending of estimates for both our owned and peer performance is necessary because the final true-up for risk adjustment is based on our performance relative to our peers. After the change in CSR and risk adjustment estimates, the $70 million premium deficiency reserve, we accrued at September 30th for our fourth quarter performance would have been adequate. As Joe noted earlier, we have taken significant actions to improve marketplace performance in 2018, as well as to reduce our overall exposure to this aspect of our business. We believe that our more robust pricing in 2018 will lead to improved financial performance for our marketplace product. And keeping with our focus on enhancing our balance sheet and improving our capital management discipline, we have made it a priority to closely manage our subsidiary capital position and dividend excess statutory cash to the parent company when possible. In the fourth quarter, we were able to dividend approximately $150 million, up from our subsidiaries and as of December 31, 2017 the company had cash and investments of approximately $695 million at the parent. In addition, our days and claims payable at December 31, 2017 increased sequentially by four days to 54 days, approximately two days of this four day sequential increase were due to the timing of provider payments, while the remainder was a result of our strengthening of claims reserves. Finally, I will add a few additional thoughts related to our 2018 preliminary guidance. As Joe said a few minutes ago, to provide for an appropriate amount of execution risk, our preliminary guidance has been developed with appropriately conservative views of medical cost baseline in 2017, medical cost trend for 2018, potential rate increases and retained amounts of revenue at risk and the turnaround of the marketplace business until we can observe the achievement of the margins implicit in our 2018 pricing. Our 2018 preliminary guidance anticipates that our Medical care ratio for the full year of 2018 will be approximately 89% compared to 90.6% for all of 2017. It is important to remember, that our 2017 medical care ratio was burdened by approximately $150 million of unfavorable prior period claims development and a net $98 million of unfavorable impact from various marketplace CSR risk adjustment and premium deficiency reserve items. Absent these items, our medical care ratio for 2017 would have been approximately 89.3%. The relatively small improvement we are anticipating in our medical care ratio when compared to an adjusted 2017 medical care ratio reflects the conservatism built into our preliminary guidance. For example, we have taken a conservative position on the turnaround of the marketplace business by adding an appropriate level of contingency for not realizing the margins implicit in our pricing. Looking beyond 2018 preliminary guidance, here are some important facts regarding what we know about our marketplace product today. We priced to a pre-tax margin of 4.6% and a medical care ratio of 65%, this compares to a pre-tax margin of 3% and a medical care ratio of 78% that was priced in 2017. Approximately 70% of 2018 members are renewals from 2017. Acuity of our 2018 membership appears to be within our pricing expectations. In general, 2018 marketplace membership appears to be tracking with our 2018 pricing, which would represent substantial improvement over 2017. Nevertheless, due to the volatility we experienced in 2017, we are taking no credit in our preliminary guidance for marketplace improvements until such improvement manifest themselves in our results. SG&A costs are expected to drop by approximately $200 million in 2018, broker and exchange fees associated with our marketplace products are expected to drop by approximately $150 million. The costs savings taken out of accounts [ph] in 2017, will reduce cost by another $160 million on top of the $75 million already recognized in 2017. These savings will be partially offset by a replenishment of our variable compensation and employee merit increase pools in cost associated with new activities such as our Mississippi and Idaho startups. We have received a significant number of questions relating to our share count and our effective tax rate. We have observed that there is a wide range in estimated share count for our company as well as a wide range in estimates of our effective tax rate for 2018, with that mind let me share the following assumptions that underlie our 2018 preliminary guidance. First our preliminary guidance assumes a diluted weighted average share count of 67.3 million shares and is based on a share price of $100 per share. This share count maybe higher than what some of you are expecting, it is primarily the result of the diluted nature of our convertible debt at higher share prices. For example, our convertible debt is not dilutive at a share price of $55, but at a share price of $100 that same convertible debt will add about 7.4 million shares to our diluted share count. As a further example, at an average share price of $80 for the year our diluted share count would be 65 million shares, at an average share price of $120 our diluted share count for the year will be 68.8 million shares. Regardless of the assumptions you make around the dilutive impact of our convertible notes please remember that we issued 2.6 million shares as part of our exchange of equity for $141 million of face value of our 2,044 convertible notes last December. These additional 2.6 million shares should be included in our share count regardless of assumptions you may make around dilution cost by our convertible debt. Second as many of you know, our effective tax rate is higher than the federal rate of 21% due to the non-deductibility of several items, but most notable the health insurance provider fee. Regarding the impact of tax reform the preliminary guidance effective tax rate of 41% to 43% would have been approximately 64% based on our 2017 tax rate. On another note, our 2018 preliminary guidance assumes that state Medicaid agencies will reimburse that in four for both the ACA health insurance provider fee and the tax impact of that fee is non-deductibility. Even if all Medicaid agencies ultimately reimburses for that fee, we will not be able to recognize the added revenue until we receive assurances from those agencies that the fee will indeed be reimbursed. Any delays in receiving such assurances will result into late recognition of the related revenue, which would sharply reduce our earnings until such assurances are received. Please keep this in mind as you assess our quarterly earnings reports in 2018. Finally, our 2018 preliminary guidance does not contemplate any restructuring charges. Cost and benefits associated with our restructuring activities in 2017 are now captured in our 2018 run rate. While we may undertake further restructuring activities in 2018 and beyond the cost associate with those activities have not been fully scoped. While we can't say with certainty that we will not incur additional restructuring charges in the future, we have not contemplated additional charges in our 2018 preliminary guidance. As a reminder, we will be providing additional detail about our margin recovery and sustainability plan in preliminary guidance on May 31st in New York City. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Sarah James of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Sarah James: Thank you. And I appreciate all of the detail about 2018 guidance. But there is a couple of pieces that I was hoping to get more clarity on tax reform benefit how much is the net on that? How much turnaround savings is assumed if we assumed flat, is there is still a drag from Pathways and then on tax, you previously talked about it and [indiscernible] similar admin cost but now it sounds like it may be offset by comp changes. So how should we think about the health contribution changing? Thank you.
Joseph White: Hi, Sarah, its Joe White, we struggled to hear you, could you ask those questions one at a time please? Thank you. Good morning by the way.
Sarah James: Sure, good morning. So, just trying to look through a few of the moving pieces on guidance that weren't spiked out, the one being tax reform, how much benefit how much benefit realized on tax reform?
Joseph Zubretsky: Sure, hi Sarah, its, Joe Zubretsky. On tax reform, if you just look at the 35% statutory rate versus the 21%, it created a $59 million benefit to our 2018 guidance, which is about $0.87 of earnings per share. I will remind everyone that as we either exceed our plan or missed it for every dollar of earnings above or below our marginal tax rate is 21%. And the reason our guidance is at about 42% is the result of a non-deductibility of the HIF. Another question we are often asked is did we change our spending outlook for 2018 because our rates were set, when tax rates were 35% versus 21%. And I would say, no, we had a plan in place of our margin recovery and sustainability plan, it does require investments to be made. Those investments were fully baked in our SG&A roles for 2018 and we did not change the course of that spending as a result of the new tax rates.
Sarah James: Thank you. And the other moving piece I was hoping you could spike out flu if there is any change from 2017 to 2018 on your assumptions there. The Pathways which has been a drag in the past if it assume to continue and then exchanges in the past you have talked about there being a tailwind from a lower admin load. I'm not sure if that still assumed going forward.
Joseph Zubretsky: With respect to flu as we said we recorded our $20 million top up to our fourth quarter. As we observed pharmacy and physician cost higher than normal particularly in the CTC Hotspots. I would tell you that that trend continued into January, pharmacy and physician costs were higher than normal due to the flu season that we are experiencing and others are as well. With respect to Pathways and our other sort of non-core subsidiaries, I mean say the earnings picture is just not material. It's stable, they're performing well, and it's just not a material part of the story.
Sarah James: Got it. And one more clarification if I could and then I'll hop off, you talked about unwinding Florida if the appeals are not successful. How long should you think about that taking. So how much time to get the SG&A overhang if no matching revenue if the appeal in Florida is unsuccessful?
Joseph Zubretsky: Sure, if we are unsuccessful in Florida and or New Mexico then we have a plan in place where we will try to transition our service profile in those states and in orderly fashion. Whether we transition it to another incumbent or new player or whether we just educate ourselves entirely. Obviously, when the revenue stops on January 1st, you still have a claims tail to service, you still have member calls that need to service. And so we'll have to hold on to part of the operating platform for the tail period. But we're not going to let the administrative costs and bringing those plans and runoff be a drag on our earnings. We'll have to educate ourselves quickly, but there would be a slight drag on 2019 as we work the claims tail off.
Sarah James: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Justin Lake: Thanks, good morning. Few questions here, just wanted to start off on the marketplace. You talked about the membership numbers and the pricing. So the math should be pretty straightforward there, but I want to make sure I got it right. I think your revenue was about $3 billion in premium in 2017. Can you give us the number there for 2018? Is it around $2 billion? And then it sounds like that you said there was no improvement assumed in terms of the economics on the margin. And I think you lost about $100 million plus for 2017, is that the right ballpark for 2018?
Joseph Zubretsky: Yes, Justin the revenue number for 2018 contemplated in our guidance is about $1.5 billion. And you have the pricing right. I mean obviously at 102.1% for the quarter 88% for the year against a target of 78%. We lost money in the marketplace this year. The way I would characterize our guidance is we cleared the clutter around 2017. Obviously getting the one timers behind us getting a cleanse claims view of the 2017 run rate projected forward our pricing at the 4.6% target margin. But until we see the effects of our profit improvement initiatives and that pricing take hold in the market, we did not include a lot of that turnaround benefit in our guidance. We need to see it emerge in the first quarter before we firm up our guidance for improved market place performance.
Justin Lake: Okay. So the $1.5 billion of premium just sound a little bit low relative to the declining membership and then adding in a 50% price increase, am I missing something there or is it geographically bias to some of the lower premium states?
Joseph White: Justin, its Joe White speaking, there are a few issues that play there, one would be the shift downward to bronze relative to sliver, the other would be geographic matter as we continue to see rather proportion stronger enrollment in Texas.
Joseph Zubretsky: Also bearing in mind that…
Justin Lake: Okay.
Joseph Zubretsky: We always project a 2% monthly decline in membership, so while we are starting the year at 450,000 it's going to end the year at about 300,000 at least in our project.
Justin Lake: Okay. And then just it staying on premium guidance for a second, premium guidance going to be - it looks like it's down about $1.5 billion when you adjust for the reclassification of some of the HIF collection or I should say the HIF collection. So that makes sense to your point the marketplace is a big part of that, but beyond that it doesn't seem like there is any organic or same store growth assumed in there and I would have thought there would be 2% to 3% which should add up $500 million to growth there. Am I - is there any offsets or any other bad guys when you think about besides marketplace? Or we just assuming kind of not much in the way of organic kind of same contract growth in 2018?
Joseph Zubretsky: So, Justin, we have slight Medicaid membership decline particularly in Michigan with an after profit are taking share. In Ohio where we run into some redetermination issues, slight not a lot but enough to matter in the bridge year-over-year. Our Medicare is up slightly we are holding on to our membership and getting good rates. And we do have two new markets, we have [indiscernible] and Idaho and the inception of our Mississippi TANF contract, which will begin in October of this year, and that's of $200 million all in. So Medicaid membership, a little bit of a slip two new market entries and Medicare is growing nicely to the rates.
Justin Lake: Okay. If I could just ask one more numbers question, I think Sarah asked around flu, is there a dollar number you can give us Joe in terms of what you think we could be looking at here relative to last year in terms of flu cost in the first quarter? Thanks.
Joseph White: Honestly not yet. We just closed the books, just literally within the past few hours and we've intentionally looked at the underline trends in pharmacy and physician, which is where we need to look and while we know we're experiencing a higher than normal flu season continued in 2018, I really can't peg a number for you right now Justin.
Justin Lake: Thanks.
Operator: The next question will be from Matt Borsch of BMO Capital Market. Please go ahead.
Matthew Borsch: Hi, thank you. If I could ask about, Joe, your view on margin levels and I know you have your preliminary guidance out for 2018 and we appreciate getting that, I'm not looking for guidance for another year. But when you think about the net margin that we see it say peers companies it's a little above 2%. Is that structurally a place that you think Molina can get to overtime because prior to this year the trailing or trailing five year average is something like 0.5%? It just seem that there is us then a structural barrier to getting to the margins that are comparable to peer companies?
Joseph Zubretsky: Well Matt, I appreciate the question, but no I really don't think there are any structural impediments in our portfolio. As I said to investors last month, this is clearly a question of performance and not a question of portfolio. We have many high performing plans, we need to fix the hotspot. As I said in my prepared remarks all of our products are just running slightly north of where they need to be to hit their target margins. And you can book inside the numbers and you can go around sort of the wheel of performance in terms of what you need to do with your network, what you need to do with utilization controls. What care management protocols for high acuity populations, holding on to more of our revenue at risk. As I said to investors last month, we are holding on to fewer dollars of revenue at risk than we think our competitors are, we need to get better on risk scoring and quality scores to hold onto the quality withholds that the states hold out to. So I clearly believe it's a question of performance and if we look at the fundamentals of managed care, on a mix adjusted basis, I still feel confident in saying we can get to the competitors range of 1.5% to 2% after tax.
Matthew Borsch: That's great, thank you. And also just one more if I could. I don't - I may have missed it, did you touch on your diagnosis of the reasons for the downsizing of the Florida arrangement?
Joseph Zubretsky: The reasons that we lost?
Matthew Borsch: Yes, yes, sorry. Yes, I know you touched on New Mexico, I didn't hear Florida?
Joseph Zubretsky: Well, we touched on New Mexico, we actually have the scoring and we're able to conclude pretty much that it was rates and not service and technical capabilities. In Florida, we have not seen the scoring yet. As part of the process, we will get the scoring, we'll analyze it and then structure our appeal or protest around the scoring parameters.
Matthew Borsch: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from Chris Rigg of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Chris Rigg: Good morning. Just wanted to get some clarification on the cost savings from the restructuring plan that are in 2018. It sounds like the run rate savings achieved by the end of 2017 were 235, I mean, you are expecting $160 million to be realize this year with the delta being realized last year. Is that correct and do you still think you're going to get the $300 million to $400 million target by the end of the year - run rate target?
Joseph Zubretsky: Those numbers are correct, $15 million in the third, $60 million in the fourth for a total of $75 million and incremental of $160 million for 2018. And bear in mind, when Joe and his team put out that longer-term target, that was not merely SG&A savings, but were cost structure savings across all the dimensions of managed care including network and care management. And yes, if the 1.5% to 2% after tax margin and EBITDA margins north of 5% are in our future, which we predict they will be. Then yes we have to achieve those types of cost savings over the next two years. And as I mentioned previously, we have not included many of those cost structure improvements and performance improvement initiatives in our 2018 guidance, we'll wait to see them emerge, before we adjust our guidance accordingly.
Chris Rigg: Great. And then along the same lines, in your prepared remarks you have noted that you guys are in the process of retaining several subject matter experts to help you with upcoming re-procurement and maybe to even do a look back analysis on the state's rate and win. Are those people that should be employed full time by Molina, are these people probably like industry standards that normally are consultants? And then are the costs associated with these experts in the guidance or are these can be treated as one-time items? Thanks.
Joseph Zubretsky: The - all the costs are in the guidance. And yes, because these proposals are in flight, we decided to add to the complement of resources, we have internally with outside resources. But ultimately if we are going to turn-on the new business and the re-procurement machine permanently, begin growing again after we return to our target margin profile then yes, we will build internal teams that are capable of routinely winning re-procurements and new bids. So because that were in flight we went outside, but ultimately they need to be built inside.
Chris Rigg: Great, thanks a lot.
Operator: The next question will be from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Peter Costa: Good morning. And hi Joe welcome back to the earning conference calls. I wanted to ask you couple of questions. So first one is just, you have done a lot of talk about the MLRs for the marketplace business, but if we exclude the marketplace business and look at all the rest of the businesses is your expectation to get to the 89% loss ratio that the MLR will improve or decrease for that business or will it get worse?
Joseph Zubretsky: Well if you look at and again, 2017, very noisy year, and so you have to sort of clear the clutter on 2017 where the reported MCR consolidated was 90.6%, 130 basis points of which was prior period development. When you started looking in at the detailed product lines, TANF reported at 92%, ABD 94.7%, Expansion 84.9%, and so on and so forth. You can pro-forma and project network contracting, retaining more revenue, better utilization controls in care management to get to our 89% and beyond. So we were very cautious on 2018 guidance not to include the results of those performance improvement initiatives, but they are in flight and we expect them to work. But because of this company's past history of execution we were hesitant to put them in our guidance are very comparable with the approximately 89% for 2018. And when we see our performance initiatives manifest themselves in earnings, we would just accordingly.
Peter Costa: So beyond the prior period development going away, you're not expecting necessarily for that other rest of the business to improve, is that correct?
Joseph Zubretsky: Yes, that's a good assumption. Our guidance for 2018 is just slightly better than the pure period for 2017.
Peter Costa: Okay. And then moving on Joe, you've come from a background with having seen far more advanced systems. How difficult will it be to get Molina's systems to the point where you need them to be, so that you can avoid fighting hotspots and instead be proactive and be sure of the performance you have going forward.
Joseph Zubretsky: Very logistic question and you're right. In this business, this is an information business primarily, and the veracity and velocity of medical cost trend information is critical to the life blood of a well-managed, managed care company. The systems here okay, we have many sources of data warehouses that create good medical insights. We have an actuarial community that I believe is very, very good. We can get better, and the investments needed to create higher velocity and more veracity of information are baked into our plans. And I think as part of our margin recovery plan we contemplate getting better information on a real time basis and reacting to the trends that are emerging in the marketplace more quickly than this company has reacted in the past. I'm running this organization a lot flatter. And I'm closer to 13 health plans than the predecessor management and with Joe and his team, Pam Sedmak on board, we're going to make sure that we serve the emerging trends more quickly and react to them on a more real time basis.
Peter Costa: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi there, it's Dave Saddle [ph] on for Windley. Thanks for the questions and welcome over Joe again. Want to just to come back to comments that you made at a prior conference kind of laying out the 1.5% to 2% in our debt margins. I'm just curious do you have an updated view of that considering the negative fixed cost leverage that comes from the unexpected New Mexico and Florida RFP headwinds. Does that changed or picking about getting to those margins or perhaps the timing of being able to do that in the one to three year target that you previously talked about?
Joseph Zubretsky: Sure, Dave. Whatever we thought we were going to achieve. And I still believe 1.5% to 2% is achievable. Obviously if there is some stranded fixed cost as a result of withdrawal from a market or two that would create a headwind. But as we've analyzed this, I don't consider any cost to be fixed. Obviously the variable costs of the plans operating the plans are easy to identify and educate. Variable's very easy to identify and we're going to right size the enterprise to the new revenue base. And so the headwind in my opinion is not in the percentage of target margin, but in the actual dollars of underwriting margin and operating profit will produce, which to some extent has been compromised if we lose these two contracts. So no, I'm not backing off the long-term margin percentages. Although, if there are fixed costs that need to come out and it becomes stranded, then we just need to work hard to get them out.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And just to be clear, is that target range excluding upside from tax reform or not?
Joseph Zubretsky: Yes, we haven't updated our long-term view, because as I've said publicly it's not clear to me and while there is no specific past line item in the rate development in state contracts whether states at least contemplate or consider the new tax regime as they structure rates on the various rating factors it's not clear to be that - it's not going - rates are not going to settle back to the after tax margins that we are seeing today. And until we see that prove out, I am not going to increase the target, but certainly there would be upside if the rating environment does not consider the new tax regime?
Unidentified Analyst: Right. Got it, okay. And then apple to apples on the non-exchange MLR improvement of 210 basis points sequentially, I think my understanding is that 4Q have less unfavorable development than 3Q, so maybe that explains some of the improvement. But I am curios what some of the other factors could have been in there I guess flu you spiked out and that was something that you had to overcome, but is there some - some approach that you could provide to 3Q to 4Q MLR.
Joseph Zubretsky: So I am going to turn it to Joe since he was obviously heavily involved in those quarters.
Joseph White: Sure, I think as you take a look at quarter-to-quarter fluctuations you obviously have to be careful in this business about what you read into them. But I think it is a pure statement to say that excluding marketplace where we made some out of period adjustments in Q4, I think your statement Dave, that there was less unfavorable development in Q4 than Q3 is correct and just reflects the general trend we have been making to improving the quality and the sustainability of our reserves. I think there is also there were some pleasant surprises in patient utilization in a couple of parts of the business and particularly on the Medicare side. I also think in some cases in some of our plans that hadn't performed as well overtime or recently as we would have liked we are seeing the benefit of new management teams settling in. New Mexico showed some improvement in the second half for the year. Puerto Rico while it had - continues to have some one-off issues related to provider sharing accruals and things like that they continue I think the positive trend. So I think overall it just reflect a general stabilization of the business, the benefits of certain cost take outs we took last year, and the - just essentially getting a lot of the heavy lifting around the increasing of reserves behind this.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks.
Operator: The next question will be from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Joshua Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. Wanted to touch basically sort of on a longer term revenue perspective and not much organic change expected in the current year and we think about in Mexico I think you sized that $1.5 billion and in term could be your 2018 expectation I don't think I heard a Florida expectation maybe we just assume the 2017 numbers pretty similar. But I want to understand you talk a little about these changes there are a few process bringing in new hires, congrats to both of them as well. And hiring external but I am just curios what you think about revenue run rate once you kind of rebase the business take out let's call $2.5 billion for the lost contracts in 2019 add back them the HIF. So really just what do you think this business grows at when do you think you will sort of be back in the RFP wining game. And then I guess on the side question the marketplace is that a business you are still in, in 2019 and beyond?
Joseph Zubretsky: Sure, Josh, this is Joe. The revenue trajectory hasn't changed in my view and all I said was we are pushing the pause button on new business growth, while we repair and restore the margins to target. I am very hopeful that that's a 2018 exercise. Meanwhile during 2018, Pam, myself, and others will be rebuilding the new business procurement machine so that we can began to participate in 2019 pipeline. So, this is not a story without growth, we are just pushing the pause button on North Carolina and Kentucky and a few other opportunities until we can actually see the margin restored and start moving to target levels. So, I would - for the long-term I do not view the story as anything different from the growth story that any other Medicare and Medicaid company is portraying. With respect to marketplace, well early on there were all the strategic views of you needed to be in the marketplace if you were in Medicaid and vice-versa. And I think the market has learned that while there are similarities in network configuration and costs that these two businesses are quite independent on each other. And that you can't really warm transfer a member between the two markets, they go into the exchange, they go into exchange. So in my view the business has to produce a target margin and cash flows that fit with the portfolio stands on its own. Our marketplace business in Texas is incredible profitable. It was Florida that was the problem and in the five other markets it's not at its target, but it is still profitable. And so, we're going to final rates in April. We are going to see how our profitability emerges this year, make that final call in August and September when you need to, but we're pretty confident that with 59% rate increases, 4.6% pre-tax target margin that this could be and is a sustainable business for the enterprise.
Joshua Raskin: Okay. And then just on New Mexico Joe, you made the comment that you know the loss was on the cost proposal portion, certainly looking at that, I think the average you guys were 150 points off the average, I think 275 points of the winners. And so I conquer with that, but there were some areas in technical that were noticeably below average around care coordination and in post-systems and some of those. It didn't look to me, I think you guys would have been fifth-place just looking at the technical scores didn't look to me like Molina was really that well positioned as an existing plan, even if you through the whole cost proposal out. So you know I assume as part of this RFP revamping and revitalization plan, I assume there's more going into that, I was just curious if you could provide some color on how do you kind of fix that sort of stuff, is it capabilities or is it just the proposal responses weren't really perfectly written and I'm just curious what your thoughts are there?
Joseph Zubretsky: First Josh, as we gone back and reverse engineer the scoring, we have us actually closer to being a third than fifth or sixth as you suggested when you remove pricing, but we going to pay that back and forth all day along. The real issues the one you suggested, I don't think our proposals as we go back and look at Florida and New Mexico reflected the capabilities that we have. We have been in New Mexico a long time, we enjoyed a good relationship with the state. Our service to members and to providers has been very good and I don't think we reflected our capabilities in the proposal well enough. And then clearly, when you're participating in a rate auction and purposely did at the 75th or 80th percentile on the range just pure auction theory is you are not going to win. And during that period of time, there was a very unclear view of how New Mexico was performing, it was all types of backlog claims and prior period development and it wasn't performing well. And so the management team at the time bid higher in the range, hindsight maybe we would have or wouldn't, but clearly due to rates in that performance in our opinion. But we are revamping the entire proposal writing machine to better reflect the capabilities that we do have in these markets.
Joshua Raskin: Okay, that's perfect. Thanks, Joe.
Operator: The next question will be from Steve Tanner [ph] of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks a lot, guys. Good morning. Just wanted to clarify some comments around target margin rates, the timeline and also tax reform as it relates to those items. So it sounds like Joe you don't expect to keep the tax benefits, but in 2018 they do represent you guys said $0.87 in the outlook. So for kind of pulling that out, it seems like the net margin goal for this year is closer to sort of 80 or 90 basis points and assuming that math is right, where should we think about the next sort of 70 to 110 bps of margin improvement coming from in 2019 and beyond and is the timeline for 1.5% to 2%, still kind of two to three years?
Joseph Zubretsky: Yes, and that's exactly the math and you've capture it appropriately, in terms of the tax impact on our guidance for 2018. In the first year of the turnaround, where we are trying to get to 1.5% to 2% after tax. All in having and after-tax margin of 1.2%, we should suggest it slightly below 1% when adjusted for sort of the tax benefit of the tax law change is a good starting point. As we said, as we look at the back half of the year, most of our businesses, at least are operating in a stable way, we have identified the underperformers. And the next margin enhancement benefit is again I hate to coming back to managed care 101, but our utilization controls are not consistent across the country in our health plans, our care management for high acuity members, our integration of behavioral and medical is very good in some places and lagging in others. Our networks contracts are - in certain places are price too high the networks are too wide. Some of our insulated contracts have unit costs that are far too high for the volumes for giving our venders. Our retained revenue, our risk adjustment scores are not keeping pace with the acuity of the population. We're getting too much back on the revenue withhold. So I keep coming back to all of the performance measures that one looks at throughout the managed care program and we can see outlook for meaningful improvement across all those measures. And that's where the arrival at a target margin will come from.
Unidentified Analyst: Understand. And just one follow-up for me, just on Illinois trying to think about that rate increase as well as the statewide expansion, I guess just most helpful maybe is just to understand what MCR is assumed in guidance and maybe would also be helpful to understand where the plan would have ended the year not for sort of the unusual items that that occurred over the course of last year? Thank you.
Joseph Zubretsky: Sure, with the rate increase we're giving and with the major corrective actions that we had to put emplace in Illinois, Illinois is in our guidance at just about breakeven for 2018.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay.
Joseph Zubretsky: And for 2017, it was - it lost money, was unprofitable for 2017.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it, okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Kevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. I just wanted to ask about the top-line, you mentioned that losing New Mexico and Florida would be bad from an earnings power perspective, I guess, if we assume that those contracts were lost and then you kind of annualized the contract 51 at the end of this year and I guess maybe your view about exchanges. And what is the right kind of normalized run rate as we enter 2019 from a revenue perspective? I do you expect revenue to be down year-over-year if you loss those two states.
Joseph Zubretsky: Yes, I mean, if we lost the Medicaid business in New Mexico and let's say if we lost the - we kept Miami Dade in Florida of lost the other regions then yes, revenue would certainly be down in 2019. There is no way that the new launches that we've had were small, I mean, Mississippi is going to be 100,000 to 120,000 TANF members to start, there is probably an ABD contract on the backend of that. But yes, I don't think there is any question that if we are unsuccessful retaining the majority of those two contracts revenue would be down in 2019.
Kevin Fischbeck: Okay. And then you talked about DCP in the quarter, I guess, DCP is being up four days and two of those it sounds like just timing, but due to reserve strengthening, is that - is the reserve strengthening in your view because it's really just the under reserving heading into the period previously or is there in your view kind of extra cushion now because of all the moving pieces that have been going on, but you kind of view this as I don't want to say over reserve, but conservatively reserved?
Joseph Zubretsky: Yes, we are appropriately and conservatively reserved. Joe?
Joseph White: I think that's fair statement, given everything we've developed in 2017 from the 2016 reserve we thought it was appropriate to not only replenish reserves to previous levels, but to allow additional cushion for everything we've seen happen this year and the variability in our reserve development.
Kevin Fischbeck: Okay. And then last question, how do you think about leverage because, I guess, when you just look at it on a gross basis you are like 60% debt to cap obviously you have some cash on the balance sheet, how do you think about where you debt to cap is now when you kind of look at all the pieces there? And then what's the target and what's the reasonable timeframe to get that target?
Joseph Zubretsky: Bear in mind I'll kick it to Joe in a minute but bear in mind that we were after our note exchange we have moved down from about 57% I believe on measured on the GAAP basis. And the reason we popped over 60% isn't because of leverage, it's actually because of the reduction to equity due to the charges we took. So Joe do you want to expand on that.
Joseph White: Yes, I think the best way to express it is that we are viewing leverage really in the same line we are as our expectation for 2018. We'll be able to make better informed decision once we see the profit improvements driven by everything we've talked about today manifest themselves in our earnings. So, basically what we're going to do now is we're going to manage cash and leverage as appropriately as we can we going to bring much discipline to it and we're being more focused on the management. But as far as any major decisions going forward, we're going to foresee how much we can grow our way into a lower debt to cap ratio through retained earnings.
Kevin Fischbeck: But right now it looks like you guys think that if you hit your plan and execute you'll be able to grow into the balance sheet you want overtime there is no need to do anything if you're hitting your targets?
Joseph Zubretsky: Yes, it's all about earnings and the sustainability and the lack of volatility in earnings. Sustained earnings is actually as much the problem with our capital base as the capital is itself.
Kevin Fischbeck: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from Ana Gupte of Leerink. Please go ahead.
Ana Gupte: Yes, thanks. Good morning. On the Texas and the Washington contracts, can you give us a sense of what the states you're thinking about on these two in terms of seen a supplier consolidation. Is it a price bid or something else around member, provider and networks or quality? And how do you feel about the positioning of Molina? And what is also the timing of the submission and the awards?
Joseph Zubretsky: Let's take them - hi, Ana, it's Jose. Let's take them one at a time. Texas the response to the Texas ABD proposal is in flight and is due to be submitted in early March. And we are told that awards will be announced as late as October of 2018. We're in 6 of 13 regions in Texas right now. And it's a statewide proposal. So obviously our first focus is to retain what we have. But there is actually room to grow, and with our service profile deep provider relationships, skilled nursing facility networks and a really good service platform, it's possible that we can actually grow in this RFP. I will remind you that rates are not part of either one of these proposals. It's all capability and service profile rates to be negotiated later. So that that phenomenon where a new player can come in and try to sort of invest in the state that doesn't exists in either one of these. In Washington with 55% market share, a great platform of integrating behavioral and medical, a track record of having won two of the nine regions already, two of the nine regions in Washington actually went into procurement in the past two years and we won them. And we actually grew our membership after we re-procured. We have 50% of our cost base in Washington running to value based contracts, which we believe is best in market. So we're feeling pretty good about both of these both from a market share perspective, the ability to grow and our service profile and track record in either state. The Washington RFP hasn't arrived yet; it's supposed to arrive in the next couple of weeks. And I'm struggling to remember the actual submission date, but we can get to back you on that.
Ana Gupte: Thanks, Joe. Just one follow-up more broadly on the states and the discussions you're having around rates and what you might expect this fall. Is the environment likely to be supported despite tax reform and might this become a tailwind to your margin expansion goals for 2019 or are you hearing anything around claw backs and does that differ by red or blue states or specific states.
Joseph Zubretsky: No, we haven't heard - first of all on 2018, we haven't - there is no discussion about claw backs. The rates on 80% of our revenue are locked in. And due to various renewal dates throughout the year 20% or not. But 80% - rates on 80% of our revenue are locked in. So 2018 we think is the avoid of any renegotiation. And look, all the rating factors with the states argue about various medical cost trends sort of back to our rate increases by including benefits and service profile, these are all types of way to structurally negotiating rates. And I'm just guarded that I'm not yet ready to declare of that the after tax margins in the Medicaid business are now going to be higher than everybody projected because of the new tax regime. But there has been no discussion specifically about taxes vis-à-vis the rates that we're negotiating, which I think is a good sign.
Ana Gupte: Got it. Thanks, Joe. Helpful, color.
Operator: The next question will be from Lee Pressman of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Zachary Sopcak: Hey, sorry, this is Zack Sopcak from Morgan Stanley. Quick question Joe, as you think about the overall Medicaid opportunity now versus back when you were doing a due diligence stepping into the November, is there anything from a regulatory standpoint that's surprising you, work requirements, states that may or may not be expanding or anything else?
Joseph Zubretsky: No, not really. When you are in this business you have to make sure you can tolerate through the necessitude of legislative and regulatory affairs and keeping track of all that is quite challenging as you know. But no, as we look at the regulatory environment, as we look at very legislative proposals, Medicaid is here to stay there is contemplation of perhaps certain states sort of merging the expansion market with the marketplace market, that's possible. There still a round flow of support for having the higher acuity populations ABD and long-term services and support in a managed environment. And I think the industry has done a great job demonstrating that these managed care savings by having those high acuity populations in managed care versus fee for services. So no, I don't think there is anything legislatively or regulatory that causes me to think differently above the attractive growth aspects of this business.
Zachary Sopcak: All right, thanks for the questions.
Operator: And the final question this morning will be from Gary Taylor of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Gary Taylor: Hi, good morning. Just a couple of questions, one for 2018 marketplace of that $1.5 billion of premium you're talking about, how much of that would in Florida, ballpark?
Joseph Zubretsky: Of the 450,000 members, I believe Florida is projected to have around 50,000, down from over 200,000 in 2017. So I would tell you that it's probably between $300 million and $350 million.
Gary Taylor: Okay. And then my other question is, I guess, I'm in the camp of one of those having little trouble on the share account I think I understand the convert dilution pretty well, but maybe I'm just missing, where you ended the quarter. So 57.1 million average diluted shares for the quarter, could you give us end of quarter basic and diluted kind of as the jumping off point?
Joseph Zubretsky: I'll take it to, Joe.
Joseph White: Sure, it's right around - end of quarter it's right around 60 million.
Gary Taylor: Okay.
Joseph White: I think what you are missing there is the impact of the exchange of equity we did for our some of our convertible notes and in middle of December, which involve issuing about 2.6 million shares.
Gary Taylor: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen this will conclude our question-and-answer session. And it will also conclude our conference call for today. We thank you for attending today's presentation. At this you may disconnect your lines.

Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Juan José, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. The results we reported this afternoon demonstrate that we are strengthening our business and positioning it for long-term success. While we still have much work ahead of us, our third quarter results demonstrate that we are moving in the right direction. Today we reported a net loss for the quarter of $1.70 per diluted share, but restructuring charges and impairment losses net of adjustments to our marketplace premium deficiency reserve amounted to $2.83 of that loss. If we look past those items, we can see that underlying operations show substantial improvement this quarter. I am pleased with the progress we have made on the restructuring initiatives we outlined last quarter. Once I have discussed our financial performance, I will provide more detail on those efforts. When I told you last quarter that we were taking aggressive, urgent and determined actions to improve our financial performance, the benefit of those actions was only potential in nature. Today we can point to the first actual measurable reductions in both medical and administrative costs. Let's start with medical costs. Our medical care ratio was 88.3% for the quarter, or 89% after we removed the benefit of a $30 million reduction to our marketplace premium deficiency reserve. To be clear, the medical care ratio for our core business, Medicaid and Medicare combined, remains unacceptably high at 91%. But we did see some meaningful sequential improvements in some of our most challenging markets, with Illinois, New Mexico, and Puerto Rico reflecting noticeable improvement since last quarter. Also as part of our restructuring effort, we are now refining medical cost improvement work streams that we believe will benefit our overall medical cost performance between now and the end of 2018. As with medical costs, general and administrative expenses are also moving in the right direction. Our general and administrative expense ratio of 7.6% for the third quarter of 2017 was 50 basis points lower than in the second quarter of 2017 and, if we adjust for the impact of higher marketplace enrollment, 30 basis points lower than in the third quarter of last year. Our marketplace performance also improved noticeably this quarter. In addition to the reduction in our marketplace premium deficiency reserve, we've benefited from other positive developments. Specifically, risk transfer is developing more favorably than we had expected and our 2017 premium increases are providing partial relief from the medical cost trend that has continued to rise faster than we expected at the start of the year. While these developments are indeed favorable, let me spend some time on the topic of cost sharing reductions subsidies, or CSRs, and their potential impact on 2017 and 2018 performance. First, I want to emphasize that our third quarter results do not include any impact from the recent decision by the federal government to cease payment of CSR subsidies. To be clear, this development may lead to an $85 million drag on fourth quarter pre-tax earnings. The key question is how CMS will perform the annual reconciliation of CSR payments. I need to explain that a little bit. As of September 30, we owed the federal government approximately $220 million for CSR subsidies already received this year. CMS has paid us about $515 million in subsidies, but we have only incurred about $295 million in related expenses. The remaining $220 million overpayment constitutes our liability at September 30. Second, we expect in the fourth quarter alone, we will incur another $85 million in unreimbursed expenses that were formally reimbursed by the federal government. Now, here is where the reconciliation process comes in. CMS reconciles the amount it pays to health plans for CSRs against the actual expenses incurred by those plans. This reconciliation is normally conducted over a full calendar year. If CMS keeps the same practice this year, our $220 million payable at September 30 will more than offset our fourth quarter expense and there will be no impact from the cessation of payments in the fourth quarter. But if CMS changes its practices and performs the 2017 reconciliation over a nine-month period ending September 30, our payable position at that date will not offset expenses incurred in the fourth quarter and we may experience an adverse impact of $85 million pre-tax. Please note that regardless of the reconciliation process, we believe that we are owed CSR payments as a matter of law and we are willing to pursue our rights in court, if necessary. For now, all we can do is wait for further news from CMS. Regarding the marketplace in 2018, there are two important points. First, 28 pricing in all of our markets is based on the assumption that CSR subsidies will not be funded by the federal government. And, second, we have already taken steps to limit our 2018 presence with the reduction of our Washington footprint and marketplace exits in Utah and Wisconsin. Turning back to our third quarter results. I mentioned impairment losses and restructuring costs as a large expense this quarter. We recorded $129 million, or about $1.77 per diluted share, in combined goodwill impairments for our Pathways Behavioral Health and Molina Medicaid Solutions subsidiaries. These are non-cash charges. We also recorded $118 million, or $1.39 per diluted share of restructuring cost. This expense includes about $50 million in additional non-cash charges for the write-off of capitalized software costs. It is important to remember that these charges are the result of the bold steps we are taking as a company to improve our performance. We look forward to moving past this stage in our process and emerging as a stronger, more profitable company. Now I would like to turn to an update on our restructuring efforts. Last quarter, we told you that we expect to reduce annualized run rate expenses by $300 million to $400 million in total by the end of 2018 and that we expected that approximately $200 million of those reductions will be achieved by the end of 2017. I am pleased to report that at the close of the third quarter, we believe that we have already reached our goal for 2017 and have lowered annualized run rate expenses by $200 million, which will be in full effect starting January 1, 2018. So that sums up the anticipated financial benefit of our efforts. Now I will talk about some of our specific work activities. You will recall that we are streamlining our organizational structure to improve the efficiency, speed and quality of decision making. Although we continue to adjust the organization as we learn and evolve, this task is now largely behind us. One result of this effort with a reduction in force of approximately 1,500 positions. We are redesigning core operating processes, such as Provider Payment, Utilization Management and Quality Improvement to achieve more effective and cost-efficient outcomes. While this effort will extend through 2018, we are already seeing improvements in some of our provider payment metrics regarding payment accuracy and inventory management. We are also remediating high-cost provider contracts and building networks around high-quality cost-effective providers. While this initiative will not show meaningful benefits until 2018, some successes have already been achieved. We are restructuring our direct delivery operations and have closed many of our clinics outside of California. We continue to evaluate the future status of our California direct delivery operation. Finally, we are reviewing our vendor base to ensure that we are partnering with the lowest-cost, most-effective vendors. As with the remediating the high-cost provider contracts, we do not expect meaningful results from this part of our plan until 2018, but progress is already being made. All of these initiatives are operational and incremental in nature. They require changes in process and culture rather than new technology or ideas. We are on a path that has been traveled by other organizations before, which gives us confidence in our ultimate success. We do not expect to see our full restructuring plan benefit until 2019, but we are already seeing some of those benefits. We estimate that the restructuring plan increased income before taxes by approximately $10 million in the third quarter of 2017. Of course, we continue to take precautions to ensure that our actions do not impede our ability to deliver quality health care to our members, secure new managed care contracts and retain existing contracts. Moving to other topics. At September 30, days and claims payable were up four days sequentially to 50 days. Cash on hand at the parent company was approximately $390 million at September 30, and we have about $200 million available through our credit facility. We took the opportunity in the third quarter to modify certain definitions in our credit facility so that we can incur the cost of our restructuring program without tripping financial covenants. We will continue to monitor our cash needs and act upon any financing needs as we deem necessary. So, to sum up our performance this quarter, while there is much left to be done, we are making good progress, we remain a company in transition and we will emerge from this process as a stronger company, proud of our heritage, focused on our mission and eager to embrace the new future. We look forward to welcoming Joe Zubretsky to the company this coming Monday, November 6. As Joe takes Molina forward into its next chapter, he will shape the future of our company with the support of thousands of superb, dedicated and determined employees. Our future is indeed compelling and exciting. Alex, this concludes our prepared remarks and we can take questions now. QUESTION AND SESSION SECTION
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Hi. Thanks. Good evening. So, the first question is...
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hi, Ana. How are you?
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Good. Thank you. How are you, Joe?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Good.
Juan José Orellana - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: So, the first question is – and it's encouraging to see that you are at least sequentially improving your loss ratios in some of the Medicaid – the state Medicaid books. So, can you talk about some of the changes that have happened sequentially and, still, you have issues in some of your books like California and all what's going on there? Where is it that you've seen underlying improvement and why? And where is it that you're not? And how does this become a systematically improved kind of consistent Medicaid result on the base book?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure, Ana. Let me say – that's a lot to talk about. I'll do my best. Let me first emphasize that we clearly understand here we have a long way to go. The process of bringing the company to a focus on successful growth and profitability with the emphasis on profitability first is a process which takes time. It involves some cultural shifts. It involves changes into a lot of practices we have. It involves a greater focus on things like capital allocation. Nevertheless though, much of what we have in front of us to improve our financial performance is what I would call basic blocking and tackling. I think you can see the impact of some of the basic actions in what's been happening in this previous quarter, in the third quarter, because the initial aspects of our restructuring plan have been much more about organization and staffing. What we're seeing helping the health plans, I think, right now in this third quarter is just a benefit of having new management teams and a handful of our most problematic health plans. In Puerto Rico, Illinois and New Mexico, we spoke to earlier in the year about how we had to swap out leadership teams. Those leadership teams have had some time to get established and I think just do some basic management, which is helping us. Now, again, these aren't fixing every underlying problem we have. That's going to be for the future. And Joe Zubretsky is going to be a big help in that. But I think what we're just seeing is, is the benefits of just a general focus on more business-centric practices. I also think in the Medicare, Medicaid plans, we are seeing some rather pleasing utilization trends which are helping us.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Just one follow-up, if I could ask; on the workflow production...
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: ... and the systems. Are there any system changes that you're likely to undertake? Or is it within the existing systems you can just change your processes around medical management? What is the path or the glide path to that 1.5% to 2% margin? And how long is this going to take with what you've done so far diagnostically?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, taking that in reverse, we haven't tied a year to that kind of profitability level. We obviously hope to get there and we hope eventually exceed it. But we haven't tied a year to that profitability level you're talking about, Ana. What I will say, though, about the systems issues is, what we are finding through this process is that many of our challenges are process-related, culture-related, not necessarily tool-related. So, for example, we operate on the QNXT HMO platform. That's a fine platform. There's no need to change that. We just need to find ways to utilize that more effectively. Hardware is hardware; pipes are pipes from an IT perspective. We're adequately resourced there. There are some areas, utilization management being one, where we are in the process of installing a new system. But, in general, again, I would just say that the issue isn't so much our systems, it's how we use our technology to achieve a desired business outcome.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Thank you. That's really helpful color.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: Thanks. Good evening, guys.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hey, Justin.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: So, first question is just on the medical cost payable. I was looking at that line versus the second quarter. It looks like it's up about 20% or about $400 million sequentially. And when you take that and you combine it with flat sequential premiums, I don't think I've ever seen anything like that in terms of magnitude of change. Just wondering if you could tell us what drove that and maybe share what's increased conservatism given the previous issues seen versus maybe actual trends seen in the quarter. What are the drivers there?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: It's a good question, Justin. I would start by pointing out that we've obviously had some challenges this year in terms of adverse out-of-period claims development. That's made us a little bit more cautious than we would normally be in terms of our reserve setting. If you look at our claims payable roll-forward from December of 2016, you'll see we actually had some further adverse development this quarter, not nearly as much as last quarter, but nevertheless, had a little bit of adverse development. So, we think it's just appropriate right now to be a little bit more cautious on our reserve setting. In some respects, medical utilization trends do look like they're moving in the right direction. I mentioned Medicare and the MMP plans a minute ago. But we do have other states where the trends are not so favorable. So, without going overboard, we're just trying to strike a cautious tone given where we've been the last year.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: Got it. And then just you mentioned that I think you're up about $90 million sequentially in parent cash. First, is that correct? And then second, how should we think about the major inflows and outflows over, let's say, the next three months, six months, nine months, and when you'd have dividends available to come up from the subsidiaries and stabilize that cash position?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, if you think of how the parent company of a collection of regulated subsidiaries operates, essentially the parent can only be supplied, other than from external funds, by its regulated subsidiaries. The flow of cash to the parent comes in two forms; it can come in dividends as you mentioned. It also comes in the form of reimbursement of expenses incurred by the parent on behalf of the subsidiaries. So, with a few exceptions, nearly all of our parent's cash expenses are reimbursed by the subsidiaries through management service agreements filed with the various Departments of Insurance. So, again, most of the operating expenses, including cash interest payments of the parent, are paid for by the subsidiaries. The other source of cash for the parent, again, is dividends. We can ask for a dividend from a state at any time in which the state exceeds, the health plan exceeds, its required net worth requirements. Generally, though that's a process at work required regulatory approval, generally through the Department of Insurance. So that's an activity we engage on during the course of the year and generally just as we find as we come to believe that subsidies are perhaps overfunded. The pattern of that can vary. I wouldn't tie it to any kind of seasonal pattern or anything. It's just something you go out and pursue, again, when you think a subsidiary is overfunded.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: Got it. Thanks for all the details, guys.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Getting back to sort of the first question. You saw the big improvement in the medical loss ratio, sequentially about 650 basis points. We know there's some one-time things in there, like the hurricane savings perhaps or maybe clinic closings causing people to have to find new doctors or whatever. But what other things are in there that are sort of one-time in nature that maybe made that quarter, third quarter, so much better than we saw in the second quarter?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, to be clear, Peter, I'm not aware of any disruption to our members' care off of the clinic closings. We make every effort to make sure that our members do indeed have physicians they can see as needed in a convenient manner. So, I'm not aware of any disruption there. You mentioned the weather. I should say that if we think the impact of the very difficult experiences in Puerto Rico in September, and our heart goes out to everyone on the Island, experiences in Puerto Rico in September, probably reduced medical care expense for the quarter by between $4 million and $5 million. The medical cost impacts of the events in Florida and Houston, which were very sad too, as far as we can tell, had very little impact on our medical cost trend. They were more or more short-term in duration. And it appears as if those communities were able to recover faster. So, if we look at hurricane impact between Irma, Harvey and Maria, probably $4.5 million to $5 million reduced medical costs for the quarter. There were other aspects of the financial performance that I think we would call out in the quarter. One, we did not have the degree of adverse claims development in Q3 that we experienced in Q2. We also had some more favorable developments in terms of marketplace risk adjustment, which resulted in increased revenue, which has the same effect of lowering our medical cost. There are certain states, Puerto Rico, Illinois and New Mexico come to mind, where, again, I think our new management teams are starting to get their feet on the ground and they're starting to make a difference in performance. And then lastly, again, the Medicare and Medicare, Medicaid plans, there've been some favorable trends there all year that I think for the first time this quarter we saw in our financial statements.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: Just as a follow-up, on you quantify the adverse claim development change from Q2 to Q3 and the risk adjustment change from Q2 to Q3?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: As far as the adverse development impact, if you look our roll-forward table in the back of the earnings release, you'll see that at second quarter we were looking at favorable development of about $31 million. We've shifted to unfavorable development of about $9 million, so that's about a $40 million swing there. The risk adjustment piece as far as Medicaid is a little bit harder to tease out. I'm checking my notes here as we speak. I would think it's probably in the – bear with me here since you asked, sorry. Probably on the CSR side for benefit probably in the neighborhood of $60 million to $70 million. I'm sorry, for the risk transfer, probably in the – I'm sorry – bad number there. In terms of risk transfer, probably in the neighborhood of an $80 million pick-up.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. And then just back to the roll-forward table for a second. So, risk adjustment got worse, is that what you're saying as opposed to better?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No, risk adjustment is not affected by the roll-forward table. I would say that the relative risk score of our members as we got assessments from various third-party players, Wakely Consulting comes to mind, indicates that our members' risk scores are relatively higher to the population than we had thought. So, the outflow...
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: Then maybe I misunderstood. Is the adverse claim development then what got worse?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Correct. That's correct.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: From 2Q to 3Q? So, that actually was a negative impact.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. But the swing itself from quarter-to-quarter was not as great in Q3 as Q2.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: All right.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.
Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you and congratulations on the quarter, reaching your initial savings one quarter early and improvement in many MLR lines. Against that positive backdrop, a few items stood out.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Right.
Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: First on ABD MLR, can you tell us if there was any contract pressuring that? And then second was DCP increase. Should we think of that as related to some of the more conservative reserving strategy, changes to its adjudication, timeline from restructuring efforts or is there something broader going on because your peers had all posted DCP increases as well?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I think the first question on the ABD development for the quarter, the only thing that sticks in my mind as far as ABD is some adjustments we had to go back in California related to certain long-term care benefits that required a true-up on premium rates from California. So, we took a little bit of a hit for that. That's the only thing that really comes to mind on ABD unique. It's tended to run a pretty high MCR lately. And Sarah, I didn't really understand your second question. You broke up there a little bit.
Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Sure. Sorry
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: After ABD...
Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Yeah, there was a days claims payable increase.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Correct.
Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: And I'm just wondering if that's related to the more conservative reserving strategy, adjudication timing changing from restructuring, or if it's broader because your peers also saw a DCP increase this quarter?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I think, certainly, the timing of certain activity, particularly in Puerto Rico, where we have a claims shop, I think certainly there were some slower payments that added a little bit of that increase to days claims payable. But, in general, the increase in days claims payable just reflects a more conservative posture to our reserves.
Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. And last, if I could, just thinking about sources and uses of cash, in the release, you commented on Pathways and MMIS not providing as much benefit to health plans. Is it possible that you could consider strategic alternatives for these businesses or is it still something that you feel Molina needs to own?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: A lot of that, Sarah, is going to have to shake out of further engagement in terms of our restructuring plan. And frankly, Joe Zubretsky is going to have to come in here and look at the entire company and make decisions about that. I would just say for now that those are indeed viable companies with established revenue streams and I would say business propositions that are attractive. What we've struggled with and, particularly, as we've engaged in our restructuring over the last six months, we've come to realize that some of the synergies we were hoping to realize in our health plan business from those benefits are not necessarily materializing. Again, though, that doesn't mean that they are without value as businesses. They are, again, very successful businesses in their own right, and we'll have to assess just about every aspect of this business as we improve operations and continue with our restructuring plan.
Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks. So, this quarter looks pretty good, but it really kind of forces me to go back to some of the questions I was asking last quarter about the decision around cutting G&A. Because when I think about this quarter, it kind of reminds me of normal Molina where you would see a couple of quarters in a row of blowout numbers and then a couple of quarters of misses and then you kind of go back and forth. And really looking forward is not only improved MLR, but also stability in MLR. So, I guess, when you think about the G&A savings number that you're targeting of $200 million, is there any way to put some sort of different spin on it as far as maybe is the number really $300 million, but you're reinvesting $100 million? Is there something else? Or I mean how do I think about that? Because it is hard for me to get my head around having this volatility in MLR from quarter-to-quarter and then cutting G&A and expecting to get a better result at the same time.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, to be clear, we definitely understand that one quarter doesn't set a trend. And I think we've been at pains to say this is – we're far from satisfied with these results. And this is a process to building a stable and more profitable company. Much of what we're trying to do, though, in terms of the restructuring plan, even when we talk about our reorganization is to develop clearer lines of communication, clearer accountabilities and responsibilities so that we can act and react in a more facile manner. So, I think building an organization and a culture more focused on profitability and more focused on operations is a key to the kind of stability you're talking about. One great example of that is we've spoken about challenges we've had in provider payment processing. Uncertainties in that area make it difficult to operate the company always in a predictable manner. So, the restructuring effort, which has a substantial medical cost component, you just haven't seen it yet, because much of that takes more time to develop, is an attempt to develop that more profitable company. I can only say, though, honestly, nothing is going to prove success like success. And we're going to have to put in multiple quarters of satisfactory performance to evidence that we're the kind of company we need to be.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: So, I guess it sounds like what you're saying is a lot of things that you want to achieve don't necessarily require a specific investment as far as...
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, there's are pretty hefty – and we don't have our 10-Q out now, but if you look at our 10-Q from second quarter, there's a pretty hefty investment there and that investment, you can see, carries over to up to $40 million of investment in Q4 in 2018. So, there's definitely investment there. It is not though, again, this process is not about bringing in all new tools that are going to miraculously help us run the business. It's about changing how we do things and our culture and our attitudes toward accountability and profitability.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then I guess when we think about the $200 million number, when I think to get to $200 million, $400 million, the other $100 million to $200 million is more on the medical cost side, if I remember correctly.
Juan José Orellana - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Correct. It would be – go ahead.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: How do we think about the starting point for both of those numbers? I mean, is there like a core G&A number, I guess, that you're saying where we're going to save $200 million off of this base number. And then, I guess, maybe we could just say a $100 million to $200 million would be 50 basis points or 100 basis points to MLR? I guess that might be the other way to think about MLR. Is that what we see at MLR? And then I guess is there a G&A number base that we should be starting off with to apply the $200 million to?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, we haven't give any guidance for 2018. But I think the best way to look at this is we talk about these in terms of run rate reductions. So, I think as you try to model what you can expect in 2018 and 2019, you should probably look toward 2016 and first half of 2017 performance. Because we really saw our first actual savings from the restructuring plan in this quarter, third quarter. So, I think, again, you would look to 2016 and the first half of 2017. That's the run rate we're comparing to.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Last question. I guess WellCare took a PDR as far as Illinois goes. Any thoughts there for you?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, I can't speak to their situation. We feel good about, or at least good enough, about our position in the Illinois bid that we don't feel it's necessary to record a PDR at this time. We've bid right around the midpoint of the rates offered.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Great. thanks.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen & Co. Please proceed with your question.
Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi there. The 2018 marketplace footprint, you're existing few markets going back in some. Overall, do you expect to grow your membership next year? And how do we think about the potential profitability shift now that you've seen where you stand relative to others? And you did bid assuming the CSRs would be in? Thanks.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, a couple of points on that. Again, we haven't given 2018 guidance. But I think we've been pretty clear in communicating that the exits in Wisconsin and Utah, the curtailments in Washington and the rate increases that we put out for the remaining markets, which are about 30% before the adjustment that assume no funding of CSR, so about a 58% blended rate increase, I would expect that our membership in marketplace is going to drop considerably next year. As far as CSR the impact in rates and everything. As I said, all of our rates assume that CSRs are not funded. So, we should have some protection there.
Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: And given the movement in the risk-adjusted, $80 million this year. I assume that was related to 2017, right, because it was in the third quarter?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No. No. No. It was movement from one quarter to another, yeah.
Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. So that was inter-year. So, what is your expectation for individual profitability this year? And can I assume that it'll improve from that level next year given the way you bid?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: We think overall as we look pure period basis for this year, we're still not approaching what we had in pricing. We're quite a ways from it. Hopefully, with the rate increases next year, we obviously price with the intent that we will be profitable. That doesn't obviously guarantee profits, as we've seen in 2016 and 2017. And we'll have to see how everything plays out with that regard.
Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: Do you have a revised 2017 public exchange or individual loss assumption for this year given the movement you've seen?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No. We've pulled guidance last quarter.
Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. One last question, you talked...
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure.
Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: ...about prior year development. Did you have any prior quarter development in this quarter? Or that maybe you makes us think if the first half was perhaps better than you'd reported.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: There's always an element of development from the prior quarter. But, again, I wouldn't read too much into that. I didn't see anything really surprising.
Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please proceed with your question.
Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research: Thanks. Good evening, guys. Just first question around the big payable boost. I guess the question would be, what was the catalyst for that? Why this quarter and not last quarter? Was there some sort of external consulting review done? And then was this a sort of one-time catch up and you now feel as though with another $400 million going through the income statement you're there? Or is this a process by which over time you're going to get to sort of that new targeted level, be it more conservative?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I would describe it, Josh, it's just more a reaction to the facts and circumstances of the position we found ourselves in as we closed the books on September 30. To be clear, days and claims payable I understand is a very valuable quick and dirty measure for outsiders to the company. We've never targeted a certain days and claims payable. I think I would just say that in general given the experiences we've had with the prior-period development, earlier in this year we just thought it was prudent to be a little bit more cautious in our reserving. I don't think I can commit to anything in terms of philosophy beyond that. We've always tried to set an appropriate reserve level. Most times, we've succeeded. It just so happens that at 12/31/2016 was one of those rare circumstances where we were indeed under-reserved, as you can see in the roll-forward table. And we're just reacting to that. It doesn't, though, reflect any sort of outside engagement or any sort of master plan as far as where we want to move reserves, though. We want reserves, it's outlined in our 10-Q, we seek to set reserves that are 8% to 10% in excess of the ultimate run out. Sometimes you miss though, and I guess you could say we're catching up.
Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research: Okay. So that 8% to 10%, that was sort of my next follow-up. So, the 8% to 10% hasn't necessarily changed and there wasn't some sort of...
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Correct.
Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research: ...consulting actuary that came in. It's just you guys have a different view of what 8% to 10% looks like now. Is that the idea?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yep, that'd be a fair statement. We set the reserves and again we usually run out a little bit better than that. Obviously in 2016 with 2017 activity, bluntly we miss by a country mile. So, we just need to reset reserves and try to get to the level, in effect restore margin.
Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research: Okay. And then just more of a strategic question. I know the board's been undergoing strategic reviews. And you now have named as CEO and I know Joe starts next week. Should we think about more to come on that, or did the board do their analysis, think the restructuring and the hiring of an experienced CEO like Joe Zubretsky is the answer? Or is that process still ongoing? Where are we in that strategic review?
Juan José Orellana - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I would express it this way. I don't think there's ever been much doubt, and today, I would say there is no doubt, that the company is strategically positioned in the right place. We think being Medicaid-focused and then playing in certain Medicaid adjacencies is a very sound strategy. We also think that the company has not always performed from an operational level the way it should have. So we think operationally, the basic blocking and tackling, we just need to be able to do better. Among many other skills, Joe has substantial skills in that area of operation. So, he can provide a lot of help in that way. But, Josh, I would describe the strategy again as play in Medicaid, play in related adjacencies, MMP plans, SNP plans, perhaps some degree in the marketplace. But play in Medicaid, focus on Medicaid and excel in operations. And that's the path forward for us.
Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research: So, I guess I was thinking more on asset base than overall corporate strategy. And I mean there was question earlier about Pathways and the MMS business. I don't know if there are certain health plans that may be suited better in others' hands. I meant more of a repositioning of the assets. Is there more to go on that one as opposed to shift away from Medicaid or something like that?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah, I think the focus right now, Josh, is operations and improving operations. As I said with MMS and Pathways, they have businesses in their own right that are good businesses. We always look at that. But right now I think it's fair to say that we don't have any major strategic directions. We've always believed in being a geographically diverse HMO. We need to do that because we are so focused on Medicaid. So, I don't think there's any grand re-strategization of the company in mind.
Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research: Okay. Perfect.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Zack Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Zachary W. Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. And congratulations on the quarter.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you.
Zachary W. Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I wanted to ask first about renewals. Given the amount of changes with the company and within the local leaderships, as you've described, how is your renewal pipeline looking? And then, with that, the RFP pipeline opportunities over the next year or so?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, sure. I think the progress so far and the outcome so far in contract renewals have been very gratifying. In early June, we won a rebate of a substantial region in Washington. In July, we won as a new entrant in Mississippi. Then in late July, we won in a rebid in Illinois that involved a geographic expansion. So, again, I think overall, we're feeling good about our ability to retain contracts. We focus on it, we pay attention to it every day and we understand how important that revenue stream is. There is a table in our 10-Q from last quarter that speaks to upcoming rebids. Florida has we've just submitted a response to an RFP there. New Mexico, we've submitted a response to an RFP there. We feel very good about our responses. We feel very good about our relationships with providers and regulators and communities and, most importantly, members in those two states, Florida and New Mexico. So, we'll have to see how they play out, but we feel good about that. Next up is going to be RFP activity in Texas. We've also bid as a new entrant in Virginia. We should hear about that soon. Following Texas, there'll probably be activity next year in Washington. And then we hope some expansions into the LTSS, Long-Term Services and Support markets in Ohio and Michigan. So we have a pretty strong pipeline now, I think a rather rich pipeline. We've also so far been very successful in retaining contracts and we're optimistic about the future.
Zachary W. Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. Sticking with the change theme and maybe a little bit more on the internal looking side. You may have gone through a lot of changes obviously in leadership and the way you operate and sounds like in the strategy going forward. Having gone through a reduction in force, which is never easy for anybody, can you just talk about morale in general, how retention is internally and how maybe the company is looking forward to this change?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, I will say one thing that I've always believed about Molina, but it's certainly been brought home to me over the last six months. We are blessed to have a very dedicated, very committed, very focused workforce. The last six months have indeed been a time of great change, and, frankly, a degree of pain. The combination of the staff reductions along with what's happened in Texas and Florida and Puerto Rico, have created enormous challenges for our staff. But I think morale is very high. Our staff remains focused. They're doing their jobs. You always have to work hard to retain your people. But I don't think statistics show we're seeing any kind of major departure of people. I think, in general, the morale of the staff is high and I think they understand that that focusing a little bit more on profitability, focusing on crisper operations is the path to the long-term success of our company.
Zachary W. Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks for the questions. Just wanted to sort of get your sense on the poor performance in the marketplace. Because when I look at the reported MCR in the tables in the back of the press release, even if I normalize that for the PDR, it doesn't look that bad. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense for where things are trending relative to what you expected coming into the year at this point? Thanks.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure, Chris. They are certainly not favorable compared to the pricing we put out for 2017 and the expectations. I'd also remind you that Q4 is traditionally a very rough quarter in this business. You do have to be careful too, understand there's a pretty substantial admin load on marketplace. So, the incremental admin load from brokerage commission and exchange fees can be in the neighborhood of 12%, 13%. So, the MCRs need to be low to be able to support the business, frankly, comparatively low to Medicaid. I guess what I would say on the favorable aspect of marketplace right now; special enrollment is decreased compared to where it was last year. You'll recall that we, like every health plan, we really experienced adverse selection with special enrollment last year. It's too soon to know the full cost trends obviously of the third and certainly the fourth quarter. But, again, we're seeing lower special enrollment in terms of numbers. I think that's helpful. And frankly, I think in some degrees, we have benefited a little bit from our relative size in terms of the risk adjustment pool.
Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then just changing gears a little bit, if you do see a substantial decline in the ACA enrollment next year, do you have a health insurer fee problem, just sort of an unencumbered membership problem that this could be an unusually large drag next year although albeit sort of one-time in nature? Thanks.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I wouldn't necessarily call it a problem. I think it's a reality. Any insurer that experiences a decline in enrollment is going to pay a relatively higher ACAP in the following year. A couple of points that are going to mitigate that for us; the first one is, is while enrollment we expect to drop for us, we're also going to be raising rates. So, our relative share of the market in that respect won't be dropping that much. We've built the ACAP into the new rates. So, we'll receive a little bit of a relief there. But, yeah, I think, in general, there is a little bit of a headwind from just I guess I would say a retroactive or a retrospective impact to the ACAP. Yes.
Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. A couple questions. I hate to come back to this reserving, but I do want to start there....
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: ...to make sure I understand it. So the reserve is up about $400 million sequentially. $200 million of that's in the other category, which is passthroughs that don't impact your P&L as I understand it. And it looks like it's up – the IBNR is up about a couple hundred million sequentially. So, if that's mostly conservatism, that's $2 a share, that's 500 basis points of MLR. So, are you suggesting that ex-charges, without that conservatism, the earnings this quarter could have been $2 higher?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, I wouldn't express it that way at all because for the simple reason, again, as we rebuild margin, yes, we are trying to be cautious. But your question presupposes that the smaller number of reserves is indeed the right number. So, honestly, I can't agree with that necessarily, Gary. Again, I would say that there are – there's a pass-through effect, there's also some issues on timing of payment, what we saw with Puerto Rico. There's some delay in payment. And that seems to me to be a dangerous supposition you're making. I'll just say that.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then if we look at the roll-forward table, the claims payed relative to the current year in the current period dropped about $150 million sequentially. Should that give us some indication of what the timing element could be? Or is it just too many moving parts with the risk adjustment changes and so forth that... <: Well, I don't think risk adjustment would impact that. I would say, though, that when I just penciled out the impact, because I thought we might be asked on days and claims payable from timing differences, I thought it was probably somewhere between a half and three-quarters of a day of the DCP increase, if that helps.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I'll think about it.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: We can always talk later.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. Thanks. Just two more quick ones.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I missed the first five minutes so just refer me to the transcript if I missed this.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: But when we look at the Chip MLR trend up 250 bps in the first quarter 210 bps in the 2Q and now down 170 bps year-over-year. I've heard you talk about just obviously more favorable utilization trends. But is there anything else that moves that TANF MLR trend so materially in your favor this quarter, just outside what you're seeing on utilization?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Bear with me; I'm flipping to that page. I would just point to what I spoke to when you particularly think of where we have heavy TANF and SHP membership proportionally, it would be Puerto Rico, it would be Illinois and a fair amount in New Mexico. And, again, those health plans are performing better. I think the shorthand answer to why they're performing better right now is simply better local management teams that have had time to get their feet on the ground. So certainly, though, the improvement in Puerto Rico and Illinois would be more dramatically reflected in TANF.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Last question. I want to make sure I'm thinking about the cadence of the savings correctly. So, you've realized this run rate of $200 million, so that's $50 million a quarter. Only $10 million was realized in this quarter, so that means you should see $40 million pre-tax just in a vacuum sequential pickup in the 4Q from this...
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: No, you need to think about that many of those costs, the benefit is not going to be realized until January, starting January of next year. So, various people are still working wrapping up their work, transitioning assignments and things like that. So, you should really think about all of our savings, predominately the number of our savings not starting until next year.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And of the $200 million, have you told us how much is G&A versus medical?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: We spoke a little bit about that. The bulk of the $200 million right now is staffing reductions. And I would bet the split in those staffing reductions between medical and admin is probably between medical and admin it's probably, $65 million admin, $35 million medical.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you.
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Just a few clarifications left. Joe, if I take the $30 million reduction in PDR and the $80 million risk adjustment benefit that you highlighted in recalc MLR, I get something in the neighborhood of 210 basis points higher. I wondered if you agreed with that. That's kind of leaving you aside of your conversation you just had with Gary on the claims increases.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, I know the impact of the risk adjustment was basically 70 bps. So, from 83 bps to 89 bps if you take out the benefit of the risk adjustment. I think we have the Tables in the back. It's a little difficult to do that calculation on the fly.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Okay.
Juan José Orellana - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: But you've got the stuff in the back, so we can talk later.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: You said risk adjustment was $80 million, right? Risk adjustment is $80 million.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: That's correct. That's correct.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Yeah. And so then from a question on exchange and the shrinkage in exchange, broadening the question out from not just the health insurer fee but just other stranded cost-type thought process. And has that been contemplated in your restructuring? Ae you already taking costs out in anticipation of the reduction in the individual book? Or should we think about some amount of negative leverage beyond health insurer fee calculation?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, there will indeed be a degree of negative leverage for the drop-in of the size that is possible. Our general rule of thumb is that once you take out obviously broker commissions and exchange fees fall off right away. So, there's a lot of admin activity that takes care of itself. But we are aware of the possibility there's going to be some admin cost stranded as a result of that, and we're looking closely at that right now.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: And that would be over and above the numbers that you're talking about in the $200 million and $400 million?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Correct, correct. Because that's going to have to be pulled out of, for profitability reasons, yes.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Yeah. Okay. And then final question. It sounds like you're comfortable with not taking a PDR relative to Illinois. Do you have an expectation around the change in, call it, wallet size that you will end up with Illinois?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: That's a really tough number to model right now because there's been some changes since the award was originally granted in Cook County in particular I think, which is creating some more competition. So, we don't really know that number yet.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And we have no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back to you.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, thanks to everyone for joining and listening. We appreciate your interest in Molina Healthcare, and we'll be talking to you soon. Thank you so much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Molina Healthcare Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on today's date, Wednesday, August 2, 2017. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Juan José Orellana, Senior Vice President of Investors Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan José Orellana - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Donnie. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare's financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017. The company issued its earnings release reporting these results today after the market closed, and this release is now posted for viewing on our company website. On the call with me today are Joseph White, our Chief Financial Officer and Interim Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Bayer, our Chief Operating Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. If you have multiple questions, we ask that you get back in the queue, so that others can have an opportunity to ask their questions. Our comments today will contain forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K Annual Report, our Form 10-Q Quarterly Reports, and our Form 8-K Current Reports. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab of our company website or on the SEC's website. All forward-looking statements made during today's call represent our judgment as of August 2, 2017, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements, except as required by securities laws. This call is being recorded and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available at our company's website, molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to the Chief Financial Officer and Interim CEO, Joseph White.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Juan José, and thanks to all of you for joining us this afternoon. The last few months have been an exceptionally busy time at Molina Healthcare, and I will do my best to bring you up to speed on everything that has happened since we last spoke. But first, let me be clear, the results reported today are disappointing and unacceptable. We must and we will do much better. And we are taking aggressive, urgent and determined actions to improve our financial performance. Those actions, which include a comprehensive restructuring plan and 2018 Marketplace exits in Utah and Wisconsin, will put Molina on secure financial footing and allow us to continue the Molina mission. My remarks today are going to touch upon four general areas. First, I will review our quarterly financial performance and our immediate financial outlook. After that, I am going to speak to how we reached the place where we are at today. Then I will discuss our path forward and our plans for restoring and reinvigorating our great company. Finally, I will conclude with some personal remarks about how I regard our current challenges at Molina Healthcare. So, taking these topics in order, I will turn first to our financial performance. Today, we reported a net loss per diluted share of $4.10 for the second quarter of 2017. This compares to net income per diluted share of $0.58 for the same period last year. High medical costs were a key contributor to our poor performance in the second quarter and our medical care ratio was nearly 95%. This high medical care ratio was the result of several issues. First, we adjusted our medical cost estimates for 2016 dates of service. As a result, we recognized in the second quarter about $85 million worth of medical costs that were actually related to 2016. Some of these adjustments to our prior-period estimates resulted from claims payments, others resulted from legal settlements with providers. As part of the broader restructuring program that I will discuss later in the call, we are undertaking a thorough and comprehensive redesign of our provider payment process. This will address issues that extend from the design of our provider contracts to the actual payment of providers. We expect this process redesign to result in greater transparency and improved administrative cost efficiency. Continued challenges in the Marketplace were another cause of our poor performance in the quarter. Settlement of risk transfer and cost sharing rebate liabilities related to 2016 dates of service reduced pre-tax income from the quarter by $44 million. We also recorded a $78 million increase to our 2017 Marketplace premium deficiency reserve. The increase in the Marketplace PDR was driven by our assessment that, based upon trends observed in the second quarter, Marketplace performance in the second half of 2017 will fall substantially short of our previous expectations. The increase in the Marketplace premium deficiency reserve, along with our decision to curtail our Marketplace presence in 2018, were both outcomes of a hard look we have taken at our business over the last few months. Finally, profitability at four of our health plans this quarter, Florida, Illinois, New Mexico, and Puerto Rico, was disappointing, even after allowing for out-of-period items. Inpatient and pharmacy costs were major contributors to performance of these health plans. Our restructuring plan includes a concerted effort to remediate high-cost contracts and to build around high-quality, cost-effective networks, even if those actions result in lower enrollment and revenue. In addition, we have recently made management changes at three of these health plans. Our administrative cost ratio was flat quarter-over-quarter, and for the first half of 2017, it was running at a much lower rate than anticipated in our original 2017 outlook. With the major step we took in our restructuring plan last week, we can expect further reductions to our administrative cost ratio in the future. There are also two other items of note that contributed to our second quarter loss. We recorded an impairment charge of $72 million, primarily related to the goodwill and intangible assets of our Pathways subsidiary. As part of the comprehensive review of our entire business, we have determined that the anticipated benefits from Pathways, including its integration with our health plans, will be less than originally anticipated when we closed on the acquisition two years ago. We also took a charge of $43 million in the second quarter for restructuring and separation costs. This charge is primarily for the termination benefits for our former chief executive and chief financial officers, and represents the contractual obligations under their employment agreements. You may recall that I told you to expect this charge on our previous earnings call. This line item also includes consulting costs incurred through June 30 for the implementation of our restructuring plan. We are withdrawing our previously issued 2017 outlook as a result of our second quarter performance, uncertainty around the funding for Marketplace cost-sharing subsidies in 2017 and the uncertainty around the timing of benefits achieved and costs to be incurred as a result of our restructuring plan. Now that we have discussed our second quarter results, let's talk about how we got here. I believe that our current situation is a result of three key factors. First, we did not properly adjust our business to absorb the growth that resulted from the Affordable Care Act. Second, we did not fully appreciate the growth in the ACA Marketplace required robust development of new capabilities that we did not have. And finally, our direct delivery network is simply not competitive with other care delivery channels available to the company. Fortunately, we are well on our way to remediating these issues. Let me talk about them one at a time. The implementation of the Affordable Care Act brought a sudden growth. We prepared for that growth by spending more on existing processes, procedures, capabilities and technologies. In hindsight, this was a mistake. As a result of trying to manage our rapid growth within an infrastructure design for a much smaller, simpler business, we experienced breakdowns in areas like provider payment, utilization management, risk adjustment and information management. The utilization management issues we saw last year in the first quarter of 2016 and the out-of-period claims expenses occurred in this quarter were emblematic of these difficulties, as are the challenges we had faced in adequately measuring our exposure to Marketplace risk adjustment liabilities. In retrospect, a better approach would have been to undertake a full review of the organization in anticipation of the potential growth resulting from the Affordable Care Act. Instead of increasing investment in existing processes, we should have conducted the full redesign of our business that we are doing now. Our challenges in the Marketplace point to the second source of our current difficulties, the failure to fully appreciate the unique demands on the Marketplace product. While our Marketplace members share many characteristics with our Medicaid members, the Marketplace is fundamentally an individual insurance market, and in some respects, very different from the Medicaid market. To be clear, our Medicaid-based provider network is an important competitive strength in the Marketplace. However, there were other aspects of the Marketplace business for which we were not as well-prepared: member billing, risk adjustment and pricing, to name a few. We have learned much about these activities, but we have paid a price for that learning. We continue to monitor our Marketplace business and remain committed to making tough decisions should they be necessary. Finally, our direct delivery network is simply not competitive with other care delivery channels available to the company. But, as with Marketplace, we have learned a great deal and we are now ready to put those insights to use. So, that is how we arrived where we are today. Now, what are we doing about it? How will we become the high-value health plan serving people receiving government assistance? We have taken a hard look at our financial performance and have developed action plans to address the issues we have identified. Fortunately, we had better visibility now into the causes of our financial performance than we have had at any time in the recent past. With improved visibility comes greater confidence that we can fix what is broken and return the company to profitability. We are streamlining our organizational structure to improve efficiency and the speed and quality of decision-making. We expect those changes to be largely complete by the end of 2017 and anticipate that this effort will ultimately yield an estimated $200 million in annual run rate savings. We are re-designing core operating processes such as provider payment, utilization management, Marketplace risk adjustment, and quality monitoring and improvement to achieve more effective and cost-efficient outcomes. While this effort will extend well into 2018, we hope to see our first meaningful results by the end of 2017. We are remediating high-cost provider contracts and building around high-quality, cost-effective networks. This initiative will take time and will likely not show meaningful benefits until 2018. We are restructuring our direct delivery operations. We expect these changes to be complete by the end of 2017. Finally, we are reviewing our vendor base to ensure that we are partnering with the lowest-cost, most effective vendors. As with remediating high-cost provider contracts, we do not expect meaningful results from this part of our plan until 2018. Of course, we are also taking precautions to ensure that our actions do not impede our ability to continue to deliver quality healthcare to our members, secure new managed care contracts and retain existing contracts. We estimate that our restructuring plan will reduce annualized run rate expenses by approximately $300 million to $400 million by the end of 2018, including the $200 million of these run rate reductions that will be completed in time to be fully effective for all of 2018. I have given a lot of thought as to how I might convey to you the sheer size of this opportunity. We have pulled guidance for 2017, and it is too soon to speak of 2018 in detail. So I think the best way to scale these potential savings is to measure them against our 2016 performance. The low end of our estimated cost improvement range of $300 million is almost 1.5 times the size of our entire income before taxes of $205 million in 2016. Obviously, our financial statements will look much different in 2019 when the full benefit of our restructuring plan is realized than they did in 2016, but I think this example captures the general magnitude of the results we are seeking. As part of our organizational Restructuring Plan, we are reducing our workforce by approximately 10%, or 1,500 employees. The reduction is designed to increase operating efficiencies, while reducing cost is part of the reorganization of our corporate and health plan operations. This was a very difficult decision and one that we do not take lightly. We never want to lose any of our talented and dedicated colleagues. We are committed to treating our departing colleagues with dignity and respect, and we'll be providing severance and outplacement assistance to those affected. We initiated the first wave of the workforce reduction last Thursday, July 27. This single action will reduce annualized run rate expenses by $55 million and constitutes a substantial down payment on our commitment to build a profitable business that delivers better shareholder value. We estimate that total pre-tax cost associated with our Restructuring Plan will be approximately $130 million to $150 million incurred in the second half of 2017, with an additional $40 million to be incurred in 2018. To be clear, these are one-time costs as opposed to the recurring nature of the benefits that we expect to see. In addition to our restructuring plan, we are taking the following steps to manage our Marketplace exposure in 2018. We are exiting the ACA Marketplace in Utah and Washington (sic) [Wisconsin], effective December 31, 2017. For the six months ended June 30 of 2017, these two health plans contributed only 60% of our total Marketplace revenue, but they constituted slightly more than half of our consolidated Marketplace operating loss. We are also reducing the scope of our 2018 participation in the Washington Marketplace. In our remaining Marketplace plans, we are increasing our premiums for 2018 by 55%. Our premium increase assumed the absence of cost-sharing reduction subsidies. Had we assumed that the CSRs would be funded for 2018, the premium increase would still had been 30%. It is also important to note that the performance of our Marketplace products in California, Michigan, New Mexico and Texas remain acceptable. We will continue to monitor political and programmatic developments in the Marketplace, and we may withdraw from additional markets for 2018, if necessary. I want to emphasize that neither our focus on profitability, nor the reduction to our Marketplace footprint suggest any diminished enthusiasm on our part for growth in the Medicaid managed care space. As demonstrated by our recent wins in Washington and Mississippi, we remain committed to Medicaid managed care and expect to claim more than our share of the growth expected across the country over the next few years. We are taking extra care to be certain that our restructuring activities improve our contract retention and capture capabilities. Our recent RFP wins demonstrate that the improvements we have made in our revenue procurement capabilities are bearing fruit. Finally, some personal remarks. The path we are on is by no means an easy one. But, as we work to place our company on a solid foundation, we are reminded that many high-growth companies have walked a similar path. We will move forward and continue our mission of providing high-quality healthcare services to people receiving government assistance. Despite the results we reported today, I want to stress how excited I am about our future. There has never been a more challenging time to work at Molina Healthcare, but there has never been a more satisfying, a more stimulating, or a more meaningful time to work here either. Today, more than 20,000 Molina employees carry a rich tradition forward into a better future. I am grateful to be one of them. On a final scheduling note, we have not settled upon a date for our next Investor Day. We are, of course, eager to meet with all of you and look forward to phone calls or face-to-face meetings as you may see fit. We will let you know as soon as our next Investor Day is scheduled. This concludes our prepared remarks. Donnie, we're now ready to take questions.
Operator: Certainly. Thank you. It appears our first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. Hello, everybody. I guess I want to ask about the restructuring a little bit. Is there any need to put more capital into any of the subsidiaries as a result of today's announcement and the things you're doing? And then also, can you give us some flavor on the restructuring and the layoffs you're taking? Is it sort of reducing head count 10% across the board or is it concentrated in certain areas? And do you have to communicate what you're doing in any way to the states' Medicaid programs?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: A.J. – and I think, Juan José, did you want to make a clarification?
Juan José Orellana - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. I just wanted to make a really brief clarification. We are exiting the ACA Marketplaces in Utah and Wisconsin. We had said Utah and Washington. It's Utah and Wisconsin.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Oh, I'm sorry for that. So A.J., I think your question had been – was your first question about capital requirements that's tied to the Restructuring Plan?
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah. And the earnings release today, and where you're at, does it require you to – is there any need for incremental capital?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No. The restructuring plan in itself does not pose capital demands for the health plans. The financial performance of some of the health plans, particularly as they relate to Marketplace performance, do indeed create capital demands for the health plans, which we are funding. But the restructuring plan itself does not touch on the capital needs of the health plans. It's funded through the parent. To the second point – I think your second point is, is we believe we're in compliance with all notice requirements in regards to any actions we are taking under the restructuring plan. And we are very closely engaged in discussions with our state partners and letting them what happens. Your third question, I think, was about the nature of staffing reductions we've implemented. I don't think you can say they reach into any specific areas more than others, with a general caveat that most of these reductions are reflecting managers and affect people leaders, individuals higher up in the organization. As part of this effort, we are trying to expand spans of control for managers, which unfortunately is resulting in the exit of a large number of our management personnel.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Okay. And I guess all of this – just maybe clarifying one last thing. I assume this is all the result of the strategic review you talked about in the last quarter. Are you pretty much done with the strategic review, or is that ongoing?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: The strategic review initiated very early this year, back in February. I think we're done with the outlines of the plan and the path forward and the setting of savings targets. Of course, there's going to be modifications as we go along. And many of these activities, such as provider re-contracting, vendor re-contracting, will continue well into 2018. But I am confident in saying the plan is fleshed out and is built and is complete in terms of planning and design. Now, again, the operation and the roll-out of the plan will continue through 2018.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. The first question, just, Joe, can you talk about how you're thinking about some of these RFPs that are ongoing or upcoming, just in the context of the financial pressures that you've seen in some of the markets? And just in particular, I was hoping just to drill in a little bit into Illinois and then into Florida, saw that the MLRs did spike there pretty materially, and those are markets where there are pretty active RFP processes in place right now.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Right. Sure. I think the most important thing to grasp, Scott, is that the savings we are deriving from the restructuring plan are not going to interfere with our ability to capture or retain any of our Medicaid managed care business. We are not retrenching from Medicaid managed care. We think these savings actually better position us to compete for contracts and better position us to compete particularly as a low-cost provider. I think everything we've seen out of Washington lately, while the developments in Washington are very murky, I think what is becoming crystal clear to everyone is that the open-ended nature of the Medicaid entitlement is coming to a close. And we are going to see more and more efforts by the federal government and the states to reign in Medicaid growth. That can be growth in spending. That can be very good for Molina. There is no doubt that managed care is a documented cost effective way for states and, by extension, the federal government to manage growth in Medicaid spending. We are taking efforts to make sure that we are indeed a low-cost provider and we are there to serve states as a low-cost Medicaid provider. So, in a nutshell, this restructuring effort is a huge benefit to that effort. I'll take your states in order. In regards to Illinois, there's no doubt that the path for the company in Illinois has been a rocky path. We are gratified that the state budget crisis is resolved. We actually received a payment on premium, I think, probably two weeks ago now. So it's good to see the premium money starting to flow. There is no doubt that we've had our challenges from a cost management area there, but we've installed a very capable new management team in that state, and I think they're already making progress in that regard. We're watching it very closely. This quarter they continued to be troubled by provider settlements and claims payments from 2016, but nevertheless, I've been gratified by my engagement with the new management team there. Florida is a situation that's colored by our experience in the Marketplace. When you take that Marketplace experience away, while Florida has not had a great year by any stretch of the imagination, again, we have a very good management team in place there, we have some very good people working there and I remain very optimistic about that health plan, too. We'll have to watch Marketplace in Florida in particular. The increase we're putting forward there is north of 50% when you include the assumption that CSRs won't be funded; around 30% if they're not. I think we're pricing appropriately, but we'll have to watch Florida Marketplace too. In general, that health plan though, I think, is on a sound footing.
Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. And I just had one follow-up question. Just if you can talk about how you feel about the adequacy of the medical claims reserves at this point? And just given the extent of the negative reserve development that you highlighted in a number of the markets, I felt maybe would have seen a bit more of a bump in the claims payable for the second quarter. So, maybe just sort of talk about your comfort with reserves adequacy at this point.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Sure. We beat the bushes pretty hard on claims reserves this quarter. We looked very closely at certain states, Illinois being one of them, that were having provider settlement issues. And we've really pushed the staff, the local staff and the corporate staff, to come forward with their best estimates. We emphasized that this constant drip-drip, I think it was probably more than a drip-drip, of old claims coming through and settlements coming through is simply not acceptable. And I think the staff has stepped up and I'm very confident we've got reserves appropriately set.
Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thanks, Joe.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please proceed.
Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good afternoon.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hey, Chris.
Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Just want to try to connect the dots a little bit on your sort of historical commentary about the exchange performance versus sort of what you're, call it, spiking out now. I guess, my understanding in the past was that the core medical cost trends were sort of running reasonably well and most, if not all, of the problems were related to the risk adjustment monies. Now it seems like you're actually seeing some real issues in the business. I guess, was the 2016 performance maybe – was your view of it maybe a little off-base or has there been sort of a fairly remarkable shift in the utilization on the exchange population for you guys?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, there's no doubt, Chris, that our experience has been – certainly we saw this in the second quarter. Our experience has been some pretty dramatic increases in pharmacy utilization among the Marketplace membership. If you look at the population as a whole compared to other membership groups, they are lower utilizers, particularly on the inpatient side. But, certainly, pharmacy trends have been much higher than we expected this year.
Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just when I think about how you're evaluating the participation next year, I guess are there certain indicators that you're looking for in the other states that would make you more likely to exit at this point? Like, just trying to figure out, like, where your mindset really is in terms of the level of participation in 2018 outside the two states you're calling out already.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, the first thing we're looking at is strategic fit. Looking back on our involvement in Wisconsin and Utah, the populations in those states were probably not significant enough to move the needle for the company in a positive way. The cost experience certainly moved it in a negative way. But, frankly, I think the markets there were just so small as to just not offer a lot of upside. So, as we look at other states, we're looking very closely at the degree to which Marketplace can support or is, in some way, advantageous to the Medicaid line of business. I think that would be most critical. But, again, we've got a little more time to decide on this. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we're prepared to make hard decisions. There's no doubt performance in Texas has been very nice. Performance in some of the smaller states, Michigan and New Mexico, has been nice. California has been okay. Florida, though, has not been a good market for us. We're going to have to look closely at it.
Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. I'll leave it there. Thanks a lot.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Please proceed.
Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Maybe I could go at medical costs a little bit of a different way. If I look at it by product, it looks like there's more headwinds than just on the exchange book. It was kind of up across all products but Medicare. So I'm wondering if this is the PYD. Because if I run the math, I feel like there's more than exchanges and PYD. Maybe you can talk through some of the other things that are driving up medical costs across, like, the CHIP, TANF, ABD book?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. And I think you're correct. I think you're correct, Sarah. We called out specifically inpatient issues in the four states that are most problematic, higher inpatient costs than we anticipated. We're seeing it in places like neonatal ICU. Pharmacy, while it is most pronounced in trend on the Marketplace product, is also an issue in certain states. So I think, in general, yes, you're correct. We are seeing cost pressure. I would say it is more outside of Marketplace, it is more inpatient than anything else, and there are specific pockets: neonatology, radiology, things like that.
Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. And on the restructuring plan, I understand the staff reduction portion, but I'm wondering if there's also any additions being made to key areas like medical management or the actuarial team? And just big picture-wise, post-restructuring, should we still think about fixed cost leverage as about 10 to 20 basis points SG&A reduction per $1 billion in revenue added, or is the fixed cost leverage changed now?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: To your first question, there are pockets of the company where we will see additional resources directed. So, for example, contract procurement, business development, RFP team, we'll see more resources directed in that area. There may be some aspects of medical management that we will indeed direct more resources to. But I think that will be a reshuffling of resources more than the assignment of new resources. We'll probably beef up our contacting capabilities, both in terms of provider contracting and just basic vendor administrative costs, vendor contracting; we think there's some opportunities there. So there are places in the company where we will see increased resources directed. To your other question, I have not gone back and looked at that scaling lately of $1 billion of revenue to what it compares to G&A lift. I think that got a little bit skewed when we went so deeply into Marketplace, which obviously has a very different administrative cost structure. I will say this though, the savings we anticipate from the restructuring plan, which at the high end are split about 50%-50% between medical and admin; and at the low end, they're probably 65% admin. The restructuring plan has the potential to lower our administrative cost ratio by as much as 100 bps.
Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thank you.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hey, Ana.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Hi. How are you, Joe?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Good.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Good evening. I wanted to check in. So it's kind of a follow-up again on some of Sarah's questions. Just doing rough math, and pardon me if this is all very quick, obviously, you just reported. Like, $1.50 or so of your EPS loss seems to be coming from continuing ops. And we've had a string of hospital reports where fallings (35:03) are clearly seeing pressure and insurers are talking about how, I mean, the MLR, at least they attribute it in part to value-based care and all of that. So, operationally, it seems like there are a lot of challenges and you're going through all these layoffs. And I understand the 50% rate increase and even 30% with CSRs and all that. But aren't you taking on a lot with everything you've got going right now? And how do you see yourself coming out of this?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, I'm not sure where your $1.50 from continuing operations, how you derived that, Ana. And it's probably not that. We can probably go into that in a separate call. Pre-tax, our loss was $314 million for the second quarter. The items we called out, which included the Marketplace premium deficiency reserve, were about $330 million. To me, that suggests more or less running at break-even for the quarter at least. But I think what we're essentially finding, and I come back to what I said in my prepared remarks, a lot of the build we've done in this company in 2012, in 2013, into 2014, when we were talking to you all about the way we were spending more money on admin, honestly, I think we placed it in the wrong direction. And I think we were doubling down on existing processes, existing methods of doing things, when we actually needed to just essentially strip down to the fundamentals and rebuild the chassis of the business. That's something we've been spending a lot of time among ourselves and the leadership team and with our consultants over the last six months or so. And I really think there is enough spend in this company to – more than enough spend in this company to manage it very well. I think we simply have to redirect people's energies and redirect people's focus to more productive activities. For example, to be revisiting...
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay. So you...
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. Go ahead.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: No. So I'm happy to know that I might be wrong and...
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: ...at least on the Medicaid you're saying the dollar amount that I came up with was – and I'll have to refine my math but...
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. But we'll talk about it.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: (37:29). You were saying?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, well, there is a lot of out-of-period activity, which I think we've closed the door on this quarter. And you look at the impairment, you look at the PDR, which is forward-looking, I think we're running at about break-even for the quarter pure period. But others may have a different opinion.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay. Now, with these losses and with this report, in terms of your capital adequacy, and how do you think your conversations would go with the ratings agencies? And because one cannot say that for sure, especially with the Marketplaces performing the way they are, that even this year, leave alone next year, despite the (38:09) things won't be bad.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. And we've been engaging, obviously, with the rating agencies over the last couple of days. They are appropriately asking hard questions. I think they welcome the Restructuring Plan. I think as we've walked representatives of the rating agencies, both of them, through that Restructuring Plan, they understand that the Restructuring Plan has real teeth. There was $55 million of cost take-out last Thursday and that is, obviously, not reflected in these numbers because it was a July event. So we're already $55 million down the path to that $200 million we've committed to for the full year. But, again, the rating agencies see the numbers you see, and they're asking hard questions and we're engaged with them. And we'll have to see how that plays out.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay. Thanks so much. I appreciate the color.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hi, Peter.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, guys. How are you?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Great.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: I'd like to dig a little bit more into your cash position and capital position at this point.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Cash at the parent was $270 million at the end of the first quarter. Where is that today? You did the bond offering. So can you kind of go through with what you have today at the end of the second quarter? What you know you've already funded down to the sub level? What you're planning to fund down to the sub level? And then whatever you think has happened with the convert?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Okay. So to take that in order, just to be clear, the notes we issued back in early May are, in effect, set aside for payment of the 2044 converts that become potentially put-able to us next year. So that is down in a segregated cash account. So that is outside of any discussions, the rest of anything else I'm going to talk about. So that's set aside, again, to protect us in the event the notes that could be put to us in 2018 are, indeed, put to us. So at the parent company, at the end of June, we had about $165 million of cash. We're going to do some further funding of our subsidiaries in the next day or so that's probably going to take perhaps another – probably bring that down to $100 million. We are also going to take a draw upon our revolver. We've spoken to our bank syndicate. They're very supportive. We're going to take about $300 million draw on our revolver, either tomorrow or the next day. With that, we should be fine. What's going to happen, obviously, is we'll incur some pretty hefty cost, as you can see, on the Restructuring Plan for the latter half of the year, but only about two-thirds of those are cash. Some of the items we have as cost for the Restructuring Plan that we talk about in the 10-Q are going to be lease terminations and all of that. And then, by the time we roll around into January of next year, in five months, we're going to have the benefit of about $200 million of run rate reduction off of where we're at right now. So I think we're in a decent position in terms of liquidity.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So, where do you think your cash will be at the end of the year, cash at the parent?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: My bet would be $200 million or $300 million.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then, I just have to ask. In Ohio, you signed this agreement with the Cleveland Clinic. Don't you think that's going to bring less healthy people to you in your Medicaid book. And at this point in time, signing up with a premier facility like that makes you concerned that you're going to get an adverse selection. Why would you do something like that at this point in time, given all the other things going on?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I'll let Terry Bayer answer that question.
Terry P. Bayer - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. This is Terry. We were successful in negotiating a very competitive rate with the Clinic, and we're confident that our commitment to that market will assist us in managing those patients.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Do you think you're going to get an adverse selection from having that in your network?
Terry P. Bayer - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: We'll know after we're in business. The Cleveland Clinic also is attractive in terms of drawing the broader population. They've been in the Medicaid network in Ohio, and that'll come into our rating as we go forward with the state agency.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And my last question, just on the Medicaid rate increase in Puerto Rico, you didn't mention that. What did you get for rate increase in Puerto Rico?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I think it's in the neighborhood of 5%, 5.5%, effective July 1.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: And what do you think that will do to your operating performance there?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: It will certainly help. We'll have to see how trends roll out in terms of medical costs, but it's a nice increase.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks. I guess, first, the $400 million number of savings that you're talking about, how much of that is in G&A versus in medical cost? Because it sounds like you are doing some things around networking and contracting and things like that, so I just wondered if you could break out...
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Oh, absolutely. Kevin, at the lower end of the $300 million end, it's probably 60% to 65% admin. Bear in mind that probably 3% of our MLR is administrative-related medical costs. So as we reduce staff, we reduce not just the admin, but we reduce medical costs. But again, at the lower end of $300 million is probably 60% to 65% admin. By the time you get to that higher end, it's probably 50%/50%.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And so when you talk about that 3% MLR, that's kind of admin costs. Are you including that in the 65% admin, or are you just kind of saying G&A is admin for this purpose?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Oh, no.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Everything else is MLR?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No. No. No, we're assigning them to the right cost category, either medical or admin.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. So in the $300 million number, 65% comes out of G&A and 35% comes out of MLR.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. I would assume so, yeah.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And you kind of gave the numbers – I'm sure we can back into it from what you gave us. It'd be just easier if we get that exclusive number. What does the guidance assume for Wisconsin and Utah exchange losses this year in absolute dollars?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: We certainly haven't shared that, and I don't have that handy right now. Sorry.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And I guess these numbers – it sounds to me like you're not really looking to invest a lot of money. So when we think about $300 million to $400 million, these are both a gross and basically a net number. There's not going to be $50 million of investment somewhere else that comes up later on. This is both a gross and a net number. Is that right?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. Well, I think you're looking at it correctly. Just remember, though, that as it is disclosed in our 10-Q that we filed and also in the AR, there's about $150 million – I think it's maybe around a $150 million cost to the plan in the second half of this year and maybe another $40 million or $50 million in 2018. But beyond that...
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: These are the kind of the one-time severance costs?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. And again, as I said, they are purely gross and net numbers. There is increased spending to support RFP and business development efforts. There is some increased spending in terms of contracting. But most of it is – to the extent we are putting more money into places, we're redeploying existing spend.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah. I guess I think certainly the impression of Molina from the outside is not necessarily that the company was fat from a G&A perspective. I mean, obviously, there's always room to cut in any organization. But I guess the perception had always been that you guys needed to do more work around the medical management side of things. And I look at the quarter, this quarter, it seems like medical costs are the problem, not that G&A somehow exploded in the quarter and that created a problem. It's really that medical costs were out of control. So I guess I just want to understand why the solution here is about cutting G&A, when I think most people would expect you to be saying, no, we should be putting more money into systems and medical management initiatives and things like that. That's usually the gameplay and we always hear from other companies is we're going to spend $100 million more on XYZ to deliver twice as much or three times as much savings in years two and three. This is just unusual to me to hear it this way.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: And I'll be honest with you, as the last four or five months have unfolded, I have been surprised too. I was not alone as you thinking that at Molina we were essentially lean from an admin perspective. What I don't think that assumption recognized was that over the last four or five years we have become probably the pure-play Medicaid, outside of Marketplace/HMO. And the reality of it is, is that with such a focus on Medicaid, we can and should run much lower than the competition. So, that's been something, frankly, of a learning process for me because I think I would have had your point of view six months ago. But as we've dived into the numbers, and we've done a deep dive, there's clearly spend we can take out of Medicaid – out of admin without harming the business. And, again, there is going to be, as I said, by the time we get to $400 million in savings, there's considerable medical cost savings tied to better provider contracting. Essentially, the restructure of our direct delivery organization is going to bring some money to the bottom line. So there are medical savings there.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And I guess maybe last question. When you talk about the provider contracting process that you're fixing, what exactly is it that was wrong with the process as it was historically? How are you fixing it? Is it just a matter of going back and taking out high-cost providers in the network or is there something else in that process?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: There is no doubt, bluntly, in terms of how we've engaged particularly certain inpatient facilities, certain hospitals, over the years. There is no doubt, frankly, that we've left some money on the table. We've come across, for example, at our New Mexico health plan. We've come across it and a few other health plans. We've had to make some tough decisions. I mentioned the fact that we've replaced leadership teams at three health plans in the last eight months. Honestly, we've just left some money on the table when it comes to engagement with providers.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And then I guess what is leading you to think that you've left money on table? Is it that you've kind of benchmarked against what Centene or Anthem are getting?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Exactly. The benchmarks tell the story. The speed with which clients become outliers, things like that, tell a story that we could've been more efficient in how we contracted.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Well, now I like it. I think I've got one more question. So I guess to the extent that...
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: ...a third to half of these savings are going to be medical management in nature, I guess it's always easier for us to model in G&A savings. I think we did some pretty good visibility and you're achieving what you're talking about really when you talk about G&A savings. Medical management is always a little more difficult to kind of rely on. To what extent do you believe that the medical management savings are kind of high-visibility things, I guess, just getting a better price and your ability to get a better price versus what you've gotten historically, versus something else that may be a little bit more nebulous as far as, like, provider engagement to change outcomes and shift volumes to lower cost settings, et cetera?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. Well, there's no doubt that it's going to be – there's no doubt that it's a little harder – because we're modeling this out for that exact purpose you've spoken to, there's no doubt that it's going to be harder to track and firmly identify savings on the medical side. But we can certainly see changes in unit costs per contract. It gets a little bit murkier when you talk about trying to encourage members to see more effective what we would call preferred networks. That becomes a little bit harder. But I think we're going to be able to measure that too. And frankly, I also think we're going to be able to measure some of our utilization improvements, as we have more time and more resources to direct to patients we can influence, to the complex patients. And I think we'll be able to see that on the utilization side too. But you're correct, it will be harder to measure.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: Thank you for your question. The next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey. Good evening.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hi, Gary.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: A couple of questions. So, going back to that $300 million to $400 million savings figure, and you've provided some context, like, comparing it to 2016 pre-tax income, I guess the question is do you have confidence that that level of savings makes its way down to the pre-tax line by 2019? Is there any reason why that level of savings, if you achieve it, doesn't find its way to the pre-tax line, ultimately?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I have very high confidence we can do that. Again, we've already got visibility into a lot of the stuff we're going to do. We've already done this summer. We're going to do this fall. Now, certainly as part of this process, we're going to have be disciplined to make sure that cost doesn't creep back in. I think everybody who's been through one of these restructuring exercises understands you've got to make sure the rubber band doesn't snap back. But we have – it's a very detailed process we're going into. We're basically developing staffing ratios. We're developing spans of control. And we're going to be looking very closely at this going forward. So I certainly feel very good about the low end of that range, the $300 million. Obviously, as you move more up toward $400 million, I think it becomes more speculative. But to answer your question succinctly, yes, I'm confident we can do that.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And in terms of – you had responded to an earlier question about, obviously, remaining committed to the Medicaid market, et cetera. What about the RFPs for new populations? It seems like it'd be reasonable to think, in the rest of this year and probably even in 2018, you may not be participating in RFPs for new chronic populations, et cetera. So is that fair or unfair?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: You're talking about Medicaid populations?
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Correct.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: We're all in. And that's not a correct statement. We are all in.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: On assuming and entering into new populations over the...
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yes.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Even in the near term?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yes. We're all in.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then my last question is, when you talked about direct delivery network not being competitive, I presume you're talking about owned physician practices and clinics. Is that fair?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Correct. And I would say owned at – managed in the way we've managed direct delivery heretofore. Correct.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And so the question was just why? Is there a little more color? I'm not sure I understand why, upon review, those weren't being managed how you think they should be or can be.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I think there are a few points. First of all, there's a matter of where our expertise is at, as part of our direct delivery strategy with our captive professional corporation. For example, we felt the need to retain our own in-house management service organization, our own in-house MSO. The MSO is the entity that does all the administrative processes for the medical group. Well, as a practical matter, we simply do not have the expertise to provide efficiently administrative services for a medical group. Secondly, it is probably just by recent definition of scale, it is impossible to build an MSO out to provide administrative services to a single medical group that's only seeing Molina members. So, right off the bat, we've really struggled with the maintaining of a full direct delivery administrative infrastructure. This is everything from setting up appointments to providing office space, to providing equipment, to providing office help. We just haven't been able to do that efficiently. Part of it is a question of expertise but part of it, frankly, is a question of scale. So, from a direct delivery perspective, I think entities that look outside to leverage third-party MSOs are going to be more effective. The second issue we've struggled with is with an in-house medical group, or what's called a friendly professional corporation. We've struggled to incentivize physicians to manage care appropriately. A third-party IPA simply has every incentive to manage care in the most effective manner. When the individual physician doesn't have a profit incentive, you're going to get a different outcome. So I would point to those two things as being the key catalysts for that decision.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Last quick one from me. I apologize, we're all digesting a lot, so I can't remember...
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: ...if you said this or if I read this. But I know there was a comment somewhere along the way that the permanent CEO search was underway and you were encouraged by the responses or something to that effect. Do you have kind of a – or when should we expect to see that announcement made? Is this by the end of the year thing for sure, or by the end of the year hopeful? Or any tighter framework for us?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I mean, I can't commit to a timeframe. I will say that the search is narrowing. There have been a number of very qualified candidates, a number of whom remain in the pool, and it's proceeding very well. I hesitate to give a timeframe. But, boy, I would be surprised if it took me to the end of the year. I'd be very surprised if it took that long.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Stephen Baxter - Wolfe Research LLC: Hi. This is Steve Baxter on for Justin.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hey, Steve.
Stephen Baxter - Wolfe Research LLC: I just want to ask a couple of questions. Hey, how are you?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure.
Stephen Baxter - Wolfe Research LLC: Want to ask a couple of questions about the business as it kind of is today and underlying trends there.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure.
Stephen Baxter - Wolfe Research LLC: So I was hoping that you could maybe provide an update on the outlook for rates in the Medicaid Expansion business and what the profitability of that business is currently running at today. I mean, our understanding is that plans are looking at a pretty meaningful rate reduction in California. So we were hoping you could share what you're expecting to see there in terms of rates that you guys have.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. There was a pretty hefty rate reduction on Medicaid Expansion in California July 1. I don't have that handy. With that said, though, there was also activity in the other direction in terms of the other Medicaid products. We had guided back in January to an overall fully-blended 4% rate decrease in California, which would include all lines of business. It looks like what we've seen of a July rate's effective, it's come in closer to 2% decrease. So that's actually been a bright spot for us right now. In general, we continue to see Expansion rates move more towards the other Medicaid, the TANF and ABD rates, as we see margins move in that direction too. But I think, in general, the outlook for Medicaid Expansion is still pretty good. So I guess I would say, Steve, that and slightly (01:00:48) just to be a little more concise, even with the drop in California July 1, we've got pretty good relief on other product lines.
Stephen Baxter - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then thinking just about the exchanges and sort of the volatility that's ongoing with CSRs at the moment, can you give us I guess an estimate, assuming that CSRs are paid for the balance of the year, how much will you have been reimbursed by the Federal Government in total for the 2017 plan year?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: CSRs, for the full – all of 2017, we expect that to run around $400 million. We expect to give back – right now, we expect probably to give back half of that. We're always in a...
Stephen Baxter - Wolfe Research LLC: In terms of giving it back, sorry, what do you mean by giving it back?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Excuse me. My voice is breaking. We're always in a position, at least have always been in the past on CSRs in most of our states, where the amount funded by the Feds is in excess of what our members utilize. So at that point, we have to repay the Feds the amount that the member in effect doesn't utilize. It's a process of repricing claims and seeing what the members' co-pays and deductibles would have been. So basically, we think it's going to be about $400 million for all of 2017, and we think we'll probably give about $200 million of that back.
Stephen Baxter - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. So then about $200 million net. All right. Thank you.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: Thanks for your question. Our next question comes from Patrick Barrett with TCW. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Patrick Barrett - The TCW Group: Hey. Thank you for taking my question. Just wanted to ask about the way that you all report EBITDA. So when you came to market with the note, it was $544 million on an LTM basis. Would be curious to know if you have the number as of this quarter and if you'd be willing to share with us which of the items you've identified that are sort of non-recurring in nature that are permissible to be added to that EBITDA number. Thank you.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Actually, Patrick, I don't have that indenture information handy. We can certainly have a call on that. The EBITDA we share is a non-GAAP measure. It is a traditional EBITDA. I would imagine the notes probably adjust for stock compensation and items like that. So I don't really have that. I really don't have that number. I think it might be running around $470 million LTM. But we should probably have a talk with you about that, Patrick. Let's have a call afterwards and we can track that down.
Patrick Barrett - The TCW Group: Perfect. Thank you.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yes. Thanks a lot. Joe, I was wondering if you could give some color on the shortfall on Pathways relative to what you were expecting. And is that another kind of delivery area where you may look to do some outsourcing as well?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Certainly. Pathways is a very interesting business. I want to be clear, it is a functioning business and it is – the fact that we took an impairment on Pathways, bear in mind, we did not impair the full amount of the Pathways goodwill for this exercise. So I want to be clear. We wrote off about 40% of their goodwill. So it's still a functioning business. From an operational point of view, we've had several challenges with that business. One challenge has been simply the retention of staff. Without the front-line client-facing psychologists and counselors, you can't build the revenue. So it's very much a business that's tied to your ability to retain individuals who can do the work to get you billed. The second issue we've run into in terms of Pathways related to that is we've had to increase various employee incentives, compensation related benefits, to retain staff for that very reason. And I think the third issue we're running in at Pathways, frankly, is some of the payors are becoming more demanding in terms of their reimbursement. The business has moved a little bit away from fee-for-service Medicaid, a little bit more to third-party payors, other insurance companies. And we've had a little bit of an issue adjusting to what they require in order for us to get reimbursed. So again, it's a good business. But those three issues I think, retaining staff, the admin costs in retaining the staff, and again, a shift of movement in terms of payor behavior have been a little bit challenging.
Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks for the update.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my question, squeezing me in here.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure, Dave.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Joe, I think before the Aetna-Humana deal break, the company had added some Medicare resources in anticipation of the divesture. And I wondered if Medicare was an area, one, of continued commitment, relative to earlier questions about Medicaid. And, second is that an area where maybe, because of those added costs prior, that might be a disproportionate area of cost reduction in your restructuring?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. We're still very enthusiastic about what I call the Medicaid adjacent Medicare space. The SNPs, the MMPs, those are just parts of the business where we continue to want to play. I don't have the full list in front of me, but we are moving into a few new geographies coming in 2018. The Medicare spend, while we're talking about ramping it up, it hasn't been astronomical by any stretch of the imagination. We'll weigh decisions like how much advertising we do and stuff like that. Let's see where we are in November and December. But I would say, in general, we remain enthusiastic about anything related to Medicare that in any way abuts the Medicaid space, and there's a lot of that.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Okay.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: So I think overall it'll be positive.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And then just one more on – you talk in the Restructuring about consolidation of regional support services. Not sure how significant that is, but I guess I would think that you would have to be running kind of the regional services in parallel with what, say, new centralized group you might build out. Could you talk about how you manage that in a non-disruptive fashion and what the cost implications are of that?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: That's a great question. When you talk about these kind of transitions, whether physically from one location to another, or just in terms of individuals assuming new duties, it has to be managed very carefully. What we're trying to do as we look at that is we're trying to look at health plans with similar characteristics. Initially, looking at this very simplistically, what I had in my head was you'd group everything geographically. And that's the way I looked at it. And the operations team spent some time with me and I think clearly demonstrated that it isn't about the geography. It's about the characteristics of the health plan. So, for example, a smaller health plan with essentially a TANF-type membership base, you want to group those together. The health plans with the more complex members, you probably want to group those together. You need to consider things like just management stability in a health plan, management capabilities. You need to consider where they are in their re-procurement cycle. So there's a lot of stuff to be considered as you create these regional capabilities. You also just want to make sure that your staff, again, have the right knowledge mix and capabilities mix. And that's a big part of what we're trying to do with our restructuring is make sure we attract and retain capable, highly motivated, highly talented people. So it needs to be done very carefully, but I think the key to it is look for the similarities that are not just obvious, like geography. And we've been very thoughtful about that.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: All right. Thanks, Joe. Good luck.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your question. And our last question is a follow-up from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Hey. Thanks for accommodating me. I didn't want to hog my time earlier.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure, Ana.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: So, on the CEO search, it sounds like it'll be pretty quick. Do you think there's any chance that you might still consider exiting exchanges? And might that not mitigate your risk of having to raise equity or whatever? But the ratings agencies, it'll certainly kind of improve sentiment on the Street?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, I certainly think we are – we said in the call – or in the prepared remarks, Ana, all of the exchange participation is up in the air right now. As I like to say, with the company right now where we're at, we have to do what the numbers suggest to us. The numbers kind of tell us what to do. There is no doubt we do have a strategic advantage in the Marketplace with our Medicaid network. But I understand investor concern about the volatility of the Marketplace. We understand the frustration there. And essentially, we've exited two of our markets, and it's up in the air on the rest. We're going to look very closely at developments, particularly in the political area, over the next month or so. We've got until September 27, and we're taking a very hard look at that. So it would not surprise me if we had further exits. We'll just have to wait and see.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay. One final one or just to follow up on that. When the state insurance commissioners are talking to you about all this, and they're equally concerned it sounds like on CSRs and everything, are they more focused on just your synergies and adjacencies, as you say, the Medicaid HMO? Does it put your Florida RFP or Illinois or anything else at risk? Or are they saying, hey, it's okay, 55% is so big that even under a stressed capital situation everything's going to be fine?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, I don't think anybody is going to explicitly link the retention of a Medicaid contract to staying in the Marketplace. Certainly we know that the departments of insurance we deal with, who do not control the Medicaid contracts by the way, nevertheless have an interest in the stable insurance market. They have a very difficult situation and that stable market, number one, is a balancing act of having insurers in the market, but also making sure those insurers have financial stability. In general, we have found the regulators very supportive of our situation. They, like us, though are sometimes caught between a rock and a hard place. And it's a case-by-case basis. We made the decision to exit Utah and Wisconsin. There may be more states. And again, we'll have to be guided, right now, by what is best for the company.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Thanks so much. I really appreciate the color so late in the day.
Juan José Orellana - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, thanks, everyone, for joining. That concludes our call for today, and we'll talk to you next quarter.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thanks, everyone.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We do thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Tuesday, May 2, 2017. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Juan José Orellana, Senior Vice President of Investors Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan José Orellana - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Colin. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare's financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. The company issued its earnings release reporting these results today after the market closed, and this release is now posted for viewing on our company website. Additionally, we announced certain management changes today that we will also be discussing. On the call with me today are Dale Wolf, Chairman of our Board of Directors; Joseph White, our Chief Financial Officer and Interim Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Bayer, our Chief Operating Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. If you've multiple questions, we ask that you get back in the queue, so that others can have an opportunity to ask their questions. Our comments today contain forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release, and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K Annual Report, our Form 10-Q Quarterly Reports, and our Form 8-K Current Reports. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab of our company website or on the SEC's website.

This call is being recorded and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available at our company's website, molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to the Chairman of our Board of Directors, Dale Wolf.
Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Juan José. Good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I'll start by providing some context around the board's decision to make the leadership changes that we announced earlier today, and then I'll turn the call over to Joe White to discuss our results for the quarter. In light of the company's disappointing financial performance and after careful consideration and analysis, the board determined that a change in leadership was necessary in order to drive profitability through operational improvements and other initiatives. The board believes that now is the right time to bring in new leadership to capitalize on Molina's incredibly strong franchise and the opportunities we see for sustained growth going forward. To be clear, these changes represent targeted and deliberate actions to enhance the company's focus and improve our competitive position within the industry. We're pleased to have someone with Joe's experience, institutional and industry knowledge capable of serving as our Interim President and CEO at this time. Joe has over 25 years of financial management experience in the healthcare industry, and served as Molina's Chief Accounting Officer since 2003. He has led the company's most recent operational improvement initiatives and is a widely respected leader both within the company and in the greater healthcare industry. Separately, I'm honored to have the opportunity to serve as Molina's Chairman and lend my experience to help guide the company forward. The board remains sharply focused on ensuring an orderly leadership transition and is commencing a search process for Molina's permanent CEO. In the meantime, we're grateful to have Joe at the helm. I would be remiss if I did not say the board appreciates Dr. Mario and John Molina's leadership and contributions for more than two decades, and looks forward to their continuing insights as directors. I want to assure you Molina's business remains strong. The company has an outstanding brand and franchise built over three decades, based on a focused commitment to mission. The board is committed to continuing this mission, achieving operational excellence and improving the company's financial performance on behalf of our shareholders, our more than 20,000 employees and our over 4 million members. We believe we can capitalize on Molina's strengths to build significant shareholder value. Now, let me turn the call over to Joe to review the quarter.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Dale, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Today, we reported net income per diluted share of $1.37 and adjusted net income per diluted share of $1.47 for the first quarter of 2017. This compares to net income per diluted share of $0.43 and adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.51 for the same period last year. First quarter results includes a $75 million pre-tax benefit from the receipt of our Aetna-Humana break-up fee. This break-up fee added $0.84 per share to both net income per diluted share and adjusted net income per diluted share for the quarter. Today's results which are consistent with our expectations represent a notable step forward for the company. Now, I want to speak to some of the line item details in the financial statement. Premium revenue increased over 15% in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016, while membership increased nearly 13% during the same period. We added more than 500,000 new members in the first quarter, most of whom are rolled into Marketplace. While we are still early in the year, we think that, as of today, both the operational and the financial performance of our Marketplace product is better than what we saw in 2016. Of course, just has been the case in previous years, we can expect our Marketplace enrollment to decline during the remainder of the year. Our medical care ratio in the first quarter of this year was 88.4% compared to 89.8% in the first quarter of 2016. This 140 basis point decline in the medical care ratio was a result of higher percentage margins in our Marketplace and Medicare products. Our consolidated medical margin measured in total dollars increased by more than 30% to $537 million this quarter when compared to the same period last year. Our general and administrative expense ratio increased to 8.9% for the quarter, a 110 basis point increase from the prior year. But as we outlined during our Investor Day presentation back in February, these results are in line with our expectations for the full year. As a reminder, we do not provide quarterly guidance. As we've said on past calls, we adjust guidance only when we believe that there is a material change to the business from what we have previously communicated. As we announced in today's press release, we have confirmed our previously issued guidance for full-year earnings per diluted share and adjusted earnings per diluted share, while also updating that guidance to reflect the break-up fee associated with the Aetna and Humana acquisitions as these were not included in our original outlook. It is important for me to reiterate that this change only adds the termination fee into our existing outlook and that we have not made any additional adjustments beyond that. Also, please note that our outlook does not include an estimate for severance charges associated with today's announcement. Looking beyond 2017, we continue to consider our options for marketplace participation in 2018. I think everyone is well aware of the variables in play here, funding of the cost sharing rebates for both 2017 and 2018, continuation and enforcement of the individual mandate and risks of adverse selection all create uncertainty around the future of the marketplace. We are currently evaluating all our options for marketplace participation in 2018. We expect to decide upon 2018 pricing, geographies and product offerings in the coming weeks. Finally, as of March 31, 2017, days and claims payable decreased sequentially by two days to 45 days and the company had unrestricted cash and investments of nearly $5.3 billion, including approximately $270 million at the parent company. While medical claims and benefits payable were flat between the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017, amounts due government agencies increased by almost $375 million or slightly over 30%. This concludes our prepared remarks. Colin, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our first question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Ziv Israel - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, this is Ziv Israel on behalf of Kevin Fischbeck. Can you comment on the timing of the management change, just seems a little unusual to provide guidance in February, then have the Analyst Day, and then change management or reaffirming the outlook three months later. Was there any concern about the ability to achieve this year's guidance or a general concern about the ability to grow from 2018 and beyond?
Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hi, this is Dale Wolf. I think you're reading too much into any of those. They're unconnected. As Joe mentioned, we have affirmed guidance for the year. So it has nothing to do with that. It was merely a continuation of a process, of the board's evaluation of the road forward, and our sense that we were not keeping up with our competitors in terms of creating value for our shareholders. And that process obviously takes some time to work through and commentated in today's announcement. No more, no less.
Ziv Israel - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. So when you think about what Molina has to do from here, where are the biggest areas of change that need to happen under the new management? What do you think they should focus on or execute on?
Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I think it's premature to list out specifically. There's a lot of work to do both by new management and – with the oversight of the board in terms of what those areas of opportunity are, we have some thoughts based on experience, but they're merely that. And we will – this will fact-based and we will work with management of the company to identify those opportunities and communicate them when we can.
Ziv Israel - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good evening. So I understand, Dale, your comments around not keeping up with shareholder value and I think you can document that. I'm just curious in light of what appears to be a relatively quick decision, or at least one that was not inclusive of management in terms of that process, what sort of diligence did the board do around the impact on the business? I'm thinking about did you talk to some of the major states or stakeholders in the company? Did you guys look at RFPs that are coming up including rebids? Have you thought about a rebranding that maybe necessary? What's the total cost? Is there a potential impact to goodwill? All that sort of stuff, I'm just curious, I understand the perceived benefits, but I'm just curious on how you guys weighed that against the costs?
Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: You asked a lot of questions in there, Josh. So I like to think that we considered all those factors and we do understand that there are a lot of RFPs coming up. I think those are pretty local market things, but we understand most of the other points you raised and it was just our sense that all things considered maybe not tomorrow or the next day, but this was the necessary and right thing to do for all of the constituencies of the company and not only the shareholders, but all the constituencies of the company.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: And Josh, it's Joe. I would just add we are feeling very confident about re-procurement of the various RFPs that are out there.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And can you share maybe some of the feedback from those various state constituents, were they comfortable with this change coming?
Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: As you might imagine, Josh, there was no way that it was appropriate for us to go and ask them what they thought about this and so we don't have any feedback, we didn't do that.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, I guess, just more internally, are there concerns over employee retention, just in light of the founder and family sort of having run the business for almost 40 years, I'm just curious if you've gotten any feedback since this afternoon.
Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I think it's a little early to tell on that. Changes like this take a while to fit in with the company. I met with the leadership team of the company today to just assure them of the board's commitment to the future of this company and commitment to the mission, notwithstanding the need for operational and financial improvement. And one of the things we talked about is the communication that would be needed going forward with employees to say those kinds of things to them and make them feel comfortable and a lot of those people joined this company because of its mission or certainly stayed because of its mission. And it would be crazy to do anything different than that and we don't intend to, we just need to communicate that to people in a time like this. You can't over communicate.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. All right, thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. Hello everybody. Maybe just first to ask, because I don't think it's been directly asked at least, so you're going through this process and you're now going to go out and look for a permanent CEO. Are broader strategic options on the table or is it strictly right now we just need to get a new CEO in here?
Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: The latter. We've got a lot of confidence in the franchise that's here and the potential of unlocking shareholder value and that's what we're set about to do including hiring a new CEO.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And maybe Joe, if I could just ask quickly on two quarterly items, it looks like you reduced the PDR by $22 million from $30 million at the end of the year for the health insurance exchange and you said it performed consistent with expectations. Can you give us a little color on that? It also looks like you realized unfavorable prior period development in Illinois Medicare and Medicaid to the tune of $20 million or $0.22, can you give us some color on that as well?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure, sure, A.J. You have your numbers reversed on the Marketplace PDR. We brought in $8 million of the $30 million PDR we booked at 12/31. So we have $22 million left. So there is an $8 million PDR reversal in the quarter.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Okay.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: In general, marketplace, as I said in my remarks, seems to be going better than it has in the past both operationally and financially. Unlike first quarter of 2016, first quarter of 2017 we didn't have a lot of unfavorable development of our estimates around risk adjustment, which was very welcome news. We feel like we're getting better setting those accruals. So in general, again, we're one quarter into the year, so I don't want to say too much. But so far, so good as far as marketplace for 2017. The Illinois situation, well, it's just one of those situations occasionally where in a given health plan, you have substantial unfavorable prior period development of claims. These are very complicated claims, often hospital claims that have extended back into 2016 and sometimes 2015. We feel like we gotten that cleaned up and feel like we're in pretty good shape going forward in Illinois, but it is about $20 million of unfavorable out-of-period development in Illinois this quarter for Medicaid, not Medicare.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Good evening. First question, just wanted to get a sense of – in terms of the longer term margin targets that John and Mario had discussed and committed to in terms of both the 4Q sort of exit trend on long-term margins and then what the company was aspiring to. Are you comfortable in sort of reaffirming those at this point or would that be sort of under review as Joe and then a newer CEO came in and sort of develop the strategic plan?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Excuse me. Well, Scott, to be clear, it's Joe speaking, to be clear, we walked those numbers back a little bit at Investor Day. We don't necessarily think we said in Investor Day in February of this year, we don't think we can exit that in that range, that margin range for 2017. So that's already been on the table. There's no reason, based on our confirming guidance today, we haven't gotten worse, but again, we need to go back and revisit those numbers. And as we said at Investor Day in February, we'll be back to you when we're more confident with something.
Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Joe, I had just a quarterly question just on – in California, it looks like the MLR large there year-over-year was pretty low, it came at 79.2%.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Right.
Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Was that just a function of the mix of the exchange numbers or was there anything sort of unique going on in the first quarter there?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No, it was just a marketplace issue. I mentioned that in total we only came down $8 million in our PDR for marketplace in the quarter, but we rearranged between states, and California actually took about a $25 million PDR benefit in this quarter. If you take marketplace out of California results, it ran in the mid-80s this quarter, which is a good quarter, but nothing extraordinary.
Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And then just one last question. Just on the sort of classic TANF and CHIP business, it looks like the MLR there was up around 260 bps year-over-year and it was sort of over 93%. So I know you cited some of the dynamics around Illinois. Just more holistically, though, just want to get a sense for the trends in that product line. And then was that segment profitable in the first quarter at that MLR? And if not, do you expect that to sort of be profitable for the full-year?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, to be clear, we've talked about over the last few years that premium increases for the TANF and CHIP business have been lagging what they need to be, have been lagging medical cost trend, and frankly, have been lagging other products. You're right that that $20 million unfavorable development in Illinois, that's predominantly TANF that has a huge impact on it. I would just say though, at a 93% MLR, I would say that TANF is borderline profitable.
Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, all right. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Yeah. Hi, thanks. Good evening. Well, again back to the management transition, I guess the question I had was, when the board was contemplating these changes and you were looking at the root cause of your financial performance in the last whatever time period, did you see it more around you don't have the necessary scale and the diversification to maybe take a blip in a state like Ohio or enter a very challenging new market, like exchanges, or was it more about we're not executing correctly and the organization needs to be turned around or is it a bit of both and how might that play into how things move forward?
Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Ana, I haven't seen anything to suggest, and I think that I speak for the board, that we aren't big enough or not diverse enough to perform better than we have. And so until proven otherwise, I'm in the camp of it's just all about execution. Execution and paying attention to the day to day details of medical cost management, administrative expense control, and on, and on, and on. It's a great franchise. It's got great assets, and we just need to improve the results.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay. I guess I'll just give like one example has been – I would say Aetna I think had some issues in the fourth quarter on exchanges and United sustained some unbelievable losses. But when you're making mid to high-single digit pre-tax margins on the rest of your book, and you have 10%, and exchange is losing 10%, it's still okay and you make your numbers, but in Molina you have 1% net margin on 90% of your business and then if you lose 10% on 10% that can be really move the needle, I mean that's where my questions is coming from.
Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Exactly. So my response to that is not to get rid of the 10%, you lost 10% on it to make the 1% net margin better, and that's where we're headed.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Dale.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. It seems like the biggest opportunity for margin improvement is on the exchange risk adjuster, specifically the encounter data capture. What is Molina doing to improve capturing risk adjuster data on the new exchange members and is there any improvement over last year on the percent of members that you have data on so far?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sarah, it's Joe speaking. I think the answer to your second question is yes, we do have more information on our members. There are a couple of things at play here. First of all, we retained, I think, 80% or so of our December 2016 membership coming into 2017. We obviously have huge lag up in understating the healthcare conditions of those members. We've also taken a number of initiatives to improve data capture on risk adjustment and member targeting and member risk assessment. I think to some degree our ability to better estimate our risk scores at the end of last year might be a reflection of having better data on our members. And I think carrying over into this year, we've seen improvement. It's not a tidal wave, it's not a landslide, it's a lot of hard work, crawling through data, looking for clues and learning how to engage members. But I think we're doing well at it. And I think come 2018, where we have the change in methodology and we're allowed to bring on pharmacy data in support of risk scores, we're going to get even better.
Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks, Joe. And maybe if I take the comments that you made about spending more time crawling through the data and comments Dale made about an increased focus on medical management, how does that fit within context of your already planned IT investments for this year and where it might need to go under this new focus?
Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: My opinion, Sarah, is that really a lot of our initiatives related to medical management, yes, there are technology initiatives, we're finding and implementing ways to reduce the number of screens, for example utilization management and medical management personnel have to click through as they address the members' needs, a lot of it is training too, and a lot of it is leveraging best practices from one health plan to the next and making sure that the knowledge is disseminated throughout the company. So it's not purely an IT solution. I don't think we're going to need massive increases by any stretch of the imagination in our CapEx or anything like that. I think what we're going to do is try to focus harder on learnings from one part of the company and bring them to bear in other parts of the company.
Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you. What percent of your business is up for rebid this year?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I don't have that (26:57), honestly, I got that number here, states that are up for rebid, probably about $700 million or $800 million of revenue, so $700 million or $800 million of revenue on our $18 billion – I'm sorry, 3.5%, sorry, doing this in my head, $3.5 billion to $4 billion of revenue on an $18 billion or $19 billion base.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: And that includes the Texas STAR+PLUS Program and the Florida Medicaid LTE program?
Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah.
Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Peter, I'm sorry for my voice. It's really concentrated in Florida, Illinois, New Mexico, Puerto Rico is coming up in 2018. So that's a little bit beyond a year. But that's – it's really Florida, Illinois, New Mexico, Puerto Rico and Texas.
Juan José Orellana - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah, Peter, this is Juan José. There's a slide in the Investor Day deck. You can take a look at all the markets and the estimated timeframes for when those businesses are going to be reprocured.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Right.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yes, but doesn't have the revenues associated with it (28:10).
Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah.
Juan José Orellana - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Right.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: And moving on, there's a question regarding the process that you're going to go through for looking for a new CEO, so we kind of track that. What is your timeframe you expect that process to go through and when should we have a result from that? And then Dale, are you a candidate for that because you've run health plans before?
Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Let me take the easy one first. No, I'm not. I actually have a full-time job today. I have a company in Florida, a private equity company that I run and that's where I live and that's what I'm going to keep doing. So no is the answer to the second question one. The first process is just getting started. We will be interviewing search firms over the next several weeks. We hope to have a search firm under contract within 30 days and then the process will be the process. I think that those who've been through this before would tell you that it might takes six months, that would be very disappointing to me. I hope to have it wrapped up well before that.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then maybe this is a question more for Joe. Joe, you tapped 27% of your PDR in the first quarter here, given that the claims tend to grow in the ACA business through the year, don't you think your – that would imply you've got more risk going into the back part of the year for your guidance to be maintained?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I don't really look at it that way. As the year rolls out, obviously, we've got nine months, we've got nine months of PDR to focus on versus 12 months that we had at the beginning of January and we've gotten better insight into developments this quarter with the benefit of three months of experience. So no, I'm feeling pretty good about our PDR right now.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: And did you have any other PDR left – or any charges left from last year that can be applied for the risk adjusters when they come out in June for last year?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I'm sorry, could you ask that question again, Peter, I didn't quite follow.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: When we were in the risk adjusters for last year in terms of how that played out, do you have anything left in reserve for that at this point or is that expected to be booked – you booked it already?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I think we're pretty tight on our reserve estimates, I don't think they're overly conservative if that's what you're asking. So no, I don't think there'll be a benefit when we settle up. I think we're pretty much spot on in terms of our estimates of 2016 risk adjustment right now.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And the last question is just sort of a detail. It looked like the guidance is down by about $0.03, is that correct, or is there something else that I'm not understanding about the overall guidance number relative to where you look for?
Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No, what we've essentially done is, we've confirmed guidance. We then added on to that the benefit of the Aetna-Humana break-up fee. And again, we haven't put any potential severance in there, so that's open. But no, I think what might be confusing you is guidance assumes a higher share count than is in our first quarter results. So that creates about a $0.03 difference between the $0.84 we reported in the benefit for the Aetna-Humana transaction this quarter based on first quarter share count, but for guidance share count it would only be $0.81.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. That makes sense. Thank you gentlemen.
Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: It's all arithmetic.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Thank you. If I could just follow-up on Peter's question initially Dale about the CEO search, I wonder if you could give us a sense of kind of your thinking about that role going forward at Molina? I mean, thank you for the timing, less than six months sounds great. But is this a person that, maybe came directly from the Medicaid world in the past, is this a person that came out of Medicare or is it maybe a combination of government focused candidates you're going to look at or everything really on the table in terms of options?
Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Everything is on the table in terms of options. I think it would be a great benefit to have someone who is pretty damn familiar with the government business, Medicaid for sure and hopefully some Medicare. So you know how you do these things, we're going to look for best athlete, but part of best athlete is having the right sets of experience.
Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And then is there the beginnings of maybe an operational improvement plan outside of what we've already heard from the company that you could tell us about or is this something that really is going to be formulated by the new leadership?
Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I think that somewhere in the middle, it's nothing we're prepared to share today, but while we're searching for a CEO this place isn't going to stand still. And the team here with interim leadership by Joe is going to be focused with the board on what we need to get going. And we're not going to wait for the new person to come, they will certainly be a big player in that, but we'll be working in the coming weeks and months on some of those initiatives directly.
Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So, it's fair to assume you've got a kind of a punch list of things to do that you're starting on right away as opposed to waiting? That's what it sounds like.
Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Punch list makes it sound too flushed out and specific, but thoughts would be a better description.
Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, very good. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good afternoon. I guess I just want to make sure I'm not reading too much into the delay in the annual shareholder meeting and the management changes, but was there anything, and clearly you're now appointing the people as executives, Dr. Molina and John, but was there anything as a part of sort of the normal proxy process that sort of raised some additional red flags with regard to the management team. Thanks.
Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: So the reason for the delay in the shareholder meeting is that it is a requirement that all material information be in the hands of stockholders with sufficient time to evaluate and consider it before they cast their shares. So we therefore deemed it would have been inappropriate to hold the meeting tomorrow with this important news today, and that is entirely the basis of the one-week delay, it is to make sure we complied with that rule.
Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just wanted to circle back up on the letter that the company had sent to congressional leadership last week. One of the things that jumped out to me was the comment that said if the cost sharing reductions or subsidies remained in place that Molina would continue its participation in the health insurance exchanges in 2018, and that seems to run a little contrary to the way management had talked about their participation at the Investor Day. So I guess is that the company's stance right now. So as long as the subsidies are maintained, you guys will continue to fully participate next year regardless of how things ultimately track through the quarter here? Thanks.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hi, it's Joe speaking. I think a better way to express that would be that funding of the CSR is almost certainly a requirement for our participation in the exchange. It doesn't make it this positive (35:59) that we would indeed participate, but it's difficult, it probably can be done, but it is difficult to price around the absence of a CSR.
Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. But I guess – and sorry to push you, Joe, but I guess the way I think a lot of people interpreted what you put in there was the CSRs alone were enough to ensure participation, not your financial performance?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I think that's a little – yeah, I think that's a little bit of a naïve reading of the letter, obviously, there is everything that goes into pricing from the rates to your provider network to competition to everything else. So I wouldn't read it in that light.
Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Just wanted to get an updated view on Medicare and how that will fit, because I know recently there was kind of more of a focus in on potentially expanding that more aggressively and just wondering some updated thoughts on that front.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: It's Joe speaking, couple of thoughts on that. First of all, in terms of Medicare, as you can see by the results we published today, we're having good progress, good success in terms of managing costs and improving margins in our Medicare products in general. So that's certainly a highlight. It is a long-term, the company does indeed wish to participate further in the Medicare market, that's going to be a deliberate and measured approach. And to how we do that is not going to be broad-brush, but it is company policy and company practice to engage in markets such as Medicare and we will do that again in a measured and deliberate way.
Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Barrett with TCW. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Patrick Barrett - The TCW Group: Hey, thank you for fitting me in. Given the unusual timing of the dismissal, I just want to ask you all to confirm that there was, aside from just performance, there was nothing that we can expect to hear regarding any kind of fraudulent activity or any reason, be it criminal or civil that you decided to make this change in what is certainly perceived as an abrupt way? Thank you.
Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: The information that we shared in the press release as to what was behind the board's thinking and what we've shared on that call today is exactly what we said it is and it's all we said and it's all there is to say. And so all of the things that you've suggested were never a part of that consideration.
Patrick Barrett - The TCW Group: Thank you.
Operator: And we have time for one last question, coming from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Yes. Hi, thanks. So just a follow-up on the base business on Medicaid, and as you're looking at your plan for margin expansion as you said on your base business, are there any kind of systemic things that you think you can do to improve margins across the board or is this more kind of a local market, state-by-state phenomenon? And finally, as you're talking to governors and if they're concerned at all and I know the vote and all is up in the air, but what might the rate environment look like, and if repeal and replace goes through, might they start crawling backwards in advance of potential cliff in 2020?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Ana, it's Joe speaking. First of all, I think it is a state-by-state effort. There are certainly certain centralized activities in terms of collecting data, collecting encounter information and there are a number of standard activities that go into getting the right rates for our members. But yes, I think it's fair to say that it is a state-by-state basis. As far as future funding in Medicaid, we as a company understand that government spending for Medicaid, whether federal or state, is going to be constrained more in future years and we're trying to build a company that is a low cost provider of care for just that reason.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay. All right. Thanks, Joe.
Operator: And there are no further questions on the phone lines at this time. Mr. Orellana, I'll now turn the presentation back to you, you may continue with your closing remarks.
Juan José Orellana - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, thank you very much everyone for joining us today, and we will be updating you next quarter.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you all for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Molina Healthcare Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2016 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, February 15, 2017. I will now turn the conference over to Juan José Orellana, SVP of Investors Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan José Orellana - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, George. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare's financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. The company issued its earnings release reporting these results today after the market closed, and this release is now posted for viewing on our company website. On the call with me today are Dr. Mario Molina, our CEO; John Molina, our CFO; Terry Bayer, our COO; and Joseph White, our Chief Accounting Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. If you've multiple questions, we ask that you get back in the queue, so that others can have an opportunity to ask their questions. As a reminder, we will be discussing the company's outlook for 2017 tomorrow during our Investor Day presentation. Today, we will only be taking questions on our earnings release related to 2016. Additionally, our comments today will contain forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release, and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K Annual Report, our Form 10-Q Quarterly Reports, and our Form 8-K Current Reports. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab of our company website or on the SEC's website. All forward-looking statements made during today's call represent our judgment as of February 15, 2017, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements, except as required by securities laws. This call is being recorded and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available at our company's website, molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina.
Joseph Mario Molina, MD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Juan José. While the 2016 results we have announced today are clearly unacceptable, I want to remind everyone that outside of the Marketplace issues, 2016 was, in many respects, a successful year. It marked the third consecutive year in which our earnings (sic) [revenues] (02:38) grew by more than $3 billion. Strong enrollment growth generated 23% more premium revenue, when compared to 2015, despite a 4% decrease in premium revenue per member per month, driven primarily by cuts in Medicaid Expansion rates. We also lowered medical costs by approximately 3% on a per member per month basis. And we continue to reduce our administrative costs. Administrative costs decreased by 5% per member per month for the year. However, ongoing issues related to the Affordable Care Act's insurance Marketplace have continued and have had a significant adverse impact on our financial results during the fourth quarter. I want to emphasize that, while the losses that we incurred in the Marketplace program are likely to capture headlines and overshadow the operational progress we have made during 2016, it has not changed the positive trajectory in our core business. In order to stabilize the Marketplace program for 2017 and beyond, we believe that federal government must do four key things. First, the federal government must continue to provide cost-sharing reductions and premium subsidies. Second, there must be a strong incentive for individuals to purchase health insurance. Third, there must be more strict validation of eligibility for the Special Enrollment Period or SEP. We must not allow the Special Enrollment Period to become a substitute for open enrollment. Higher costs from people enrolling through the SEP force insurance companies to raise premiums for everyone. And finally, the flaws in the risk transfer methodology must be addressed now. Our Marketplace challenges are not new and have negatively affected many of the industry to a varying degrees. During our third quarter call, I spent a considerable amount of time outlining the deficiencies and the mechanics behind Marketplace risk transfer methodology. As a reminder, the program's key weakness is that it redistributes dollars among health plans based on total premiums and not purely health risk. The methodology penalizes low cost and low premium health insurers like Molina. This flaw has transformed Molina into one of the largest net payers into the risk transfer pools. To put this in perspective, 24% of our 2016 premiums were transferred to our competitors. During the fourth quarter alone, we accrued an additional $152 million in risk transfer payments. And for the 2016 benefit year, we have accrued approximately $520 million. As reflected in the Federal Register in late December, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services made changes to this methodology, and will reduce the statewide average premium in the risk transfer formula to 86% of the statewide average premium to account for the portion of administrative costs that do not vary with claims. This change is too little and maybe too late. Had the risk transfer methodology changes that CMS announced for 2018 been in effect for all of 2016, we estimate that our pre-tax income would have been approximately $70 million higher for all of 2016. We continue to advocate for changes to the risk transfer methodology. We are also seeking money owed to us for risk corridors. Molina has filed a lawsuit against the federal government in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims on behalf of its health plan subsidiaries participating in the Marketplace program. The lawsuit seeks the recovery of over $50 million in damages for 2015, and roughly $90 million owed for 2016 for the federal government's failure to honor its obligations related to Molina's participation in the healthcare marketplaces. Moving beyond issues of public policy to specific company related issues, I want to talk further about our Marketplace results in the fourth quarter. Many of you will recall that during our second and third quarter calls, we highlighted four factors that would reduce Marketplace profitability in the second half of the year. Those factors were: number one, normal membership attrition; two, the addition of higher cost members through the special enrollment process; three, higher cost, as members reach the limits of the cost-sharing provisions of their coverage; and four, increasing utilization, as members become more engaged with our care networks. John will go into more detail in a minute, but I want to point out that the financial impact of the last three of these items was more pervasive in the fourth quarter than we had expected. Those developments not only reduced fourth quarter performance, but also led us take a closer look at our 2017 pricing. As a result, we recorded a $30 million premium deficiency reserve in the fourth quarter. I noted earlier that our management team has identified the Marketplace challenges and remains focused on taking action to address them quickly and efficiently. We have therefore increased our Marketplace premium rates between 6% and 37% across all of our markets, resulting in an average of about 15%. And we'll continue to advocate for policies that stabilize the marketplace. With that said, and recognizing that we are one of the nation's largest marketplace providers, we believe there are simply too many unknowns with the Marketplace program to commit to our participation beyond 2017. We will wait and see how the new administration and Congress will adjust the program, and we plan to evaluate our participation on a state-by-state basis. On another front, we are disappointed by the court ruling last month, which blocked the merger Aetna and Humana. And while Aetna and Humana have terminated their transaction and consequently their divestiture transaction of Medicare assets to Molina, we remain committed to growing our Medicare Advantage program. We intend to build on the experience we have developed in delivering quality healthcare to nearly 100,000 Medicare beneficiaries in 11 states. And we wish Aetna and Humana the best of luck. Our company has always been committed to seeing that each of our plans is measured for quality by the National Committee for Quality Assurance. Why does quality matter and why is quality important? There are two important financial reasons. First, a growing number of states are tying reimbursement and patient assignment to quality scores. And second, Medicare links quality scores to our premium rates. We're proud that all of our eligible health plans, 11 in total, have been accredited by the National Committee for Quality Assurance. Furthermore, nine of our health plans have been accredited for Marketplace. Finally, our plans in New Mexico, Utah and Washington were top rated Medicaid health plans in their states. We're proud of our continued success as we work to deliver the highest quality care to the population we've served for the last 36 years. All of our eligible health plans maintained or increased their star ratings for Medicare. Furthermore, our Michigan health plan was the highest rated plan among Medicare Special Needs Plans for dual-eligible beneficiaries; and our New Mexico health plan earned four stars. Despite the difficulties we encountered in 2016, we are looking forward to improvement in 2017. As has been our practice, we will reserve our comments on our outlook for 2017 for Investor Day tomorrow. I would now like to turn the call over to John.
John C. Molina, JD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Mario. Before I get into the fourth quarter and year-end results, I wanted to correct what I believe is a misstatement you made, Mario. You said that this was the third consecutive year in which our earnings grew by $3 billion, and in fact, it was our revenues grew by $3 billion, not our earnings. Thank you. Today, we reported full year net income per diluted share of $0.14 and a net loss of $1.64 per diluted share for the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis, full year net income was $0.50 per diluted share, and a net loss of $1.54 per diluted share during the fourth quarter. As Mario noted earlier, poor results in the Marketplace program was the primary challenge impacting our 2016 results. However, the results of our business is faring better. To be clear, fourth quarter results for our Medicaid and Medicare business were adversely impacted by about $60 million of out-of-period items primarily related to revenue. But even allowing for that, we have good reason to be satisfied with our Medicaid and Medicare performance in 2016. Entering this year, our Medicaid and Medicare programs were under considerable stress as a result of declining Medicaid expansion margins, and disappointing results at our Ohio, Texas and Puerto Rico health plans. For the full year 2016, however, the combined medical care ratio of our TANF, ABD, Medicare, and MMP membership decreased to 91.3% from 92% in 2015. In the past, when we've encountered problems, they were primarily related to medical costs. Our issues in the fourth quarter as we have outlined in the earnings release are predominantly revenue related. In the Marketplace, we continue to suffer from reductions to revenue as a result of a risk transfer payments that far exceed the favorable results we are seeing in the reduced medical expenses. In our Medicaid business, we continued to experience retroactive reductions to revenue that in some cases extend back a year or more. Unlike many of our competitors that have reported poor Marketplace results due to adverse risk selection, which raised their medical costs, our performance issues are linked to a risk transfer methodology that has depressed our at-risk revenue. Let's take a closer look at what happened in 2016 by starting with Marketplace. We think it is worthwhile to compare 2016 results to what we would have expected based on our 2016 pricing. It is important to remember that we developed our 2016 pricing with essentially no visibility into historic risk transfer payments. Based on our 2016 enrollment, our Marketplace program was priced to produce income before taxes of approximately $60 million for the year. Instead, we lost $110 million. The $170 million difference between our reported results and our expectations is due to the following four factors. Number one, risk transfer payments were approximately $325 million higher than anticipated in our pricing. Number two, despite this $325 million reduction in revenue for risk transfer payments, medical costs were only $120 million lower than anticipated by our pricing model. In other words, we lost nearly $3 of revenue per every $1 of medical cost reduction. Three, other items increased pre-tax income by approximately $65 million. And four, we reported a $30 million premium deficiency reserve for the Marketplace in 2017. Let me take you through these items in order. First, we must address the risk transfer payments. As Mario mentioned during the third quarter conference call, the Marketplace risk transfer methodology penalizes efficient and affordable health plans like Molina, harms our performance, and makes it harder for patients to purchase affordable Marketplace policies. And once again, risk transfer contributed to our Marketplace difficulties in the fourth quarter. Marketplace revenue decreased 16% in the fourth quarter of 2016, yet our risk transfer remained constant from the previous quarter. This had a negative impact of $24 million on the fourth quarter. Second, risk transfer payments do not offset higher medical costs on a one-for-one basis. While we recorded $325 million of additional risk transfer, we were only able to offset that with $120 million of lower medical costs. Last, regarding our premium deficiency reserve, accounting rules require the immediate recognition of a loss associated with the group of members as soon as that loss becomes certain. Our premium deficiency reserve is an estimate of the losses we expect to incur in 2017 for those members who had enrolled as of December 31, 2016. The premium deficiency reserve does not include estimated losses from members, including Special Enrollment Period members who will active in 2017, but who are not enrolled as of December 31, 2016. So the premium deficiency reserve does not capture all Marketplace losses we are likely to occur in 2017, but only those that are truly locked in for 2017 as of December 31, 2016. We will explain this further when we discuss our 2017 outlook at our Investor Day tomorrow. We evaluate our Marketplace programs for premium deficiency on a state-by-state basis. Now, let's talk about the fourth quarter. We have previously shared with you that we expected additional challenges in the Marketplace for the fourth quarter of 2016. We expected lower financial results in the fourth quarter as a result of four trends: normal membership attrition, the addition of higher cost members in the special enrollment process, higher cost as members reached the limits of the cost sharing provisions of the coverage; and increasing utilization as members become more engaged with our care networks. Throughout the fourth quarter, all of these trends except the first, that is normal member attrition, were more pronounced than we had expected. First, the number of members enrolled in the special enrollment process increased by an unexpectedly large amount in the fourth quarter. Because these members bring with them pent-up demand and lower risks scores, they're a drag on profitability compared to those joining us to the normal annual enrollment period. It has been well documented that SEP members come in with higher costs. Specifically, we estimate that the average medical care ratio for those SEP members that enrolled during the fourth quarter of 2016 was 185%. Increased utilization driven by special enrollment membership was compounded by higher pharmacy cost at the number of prescriptions filled by our members, especially early refills, increased during the month of December. Per-member per-month pharmacy cost increased by approximately 10% over the November run rate. Whether these developments were a result of patients being worried about losing their coverage after the November elections, we don't know. But there is no doubt that these developments put pressure on our fourth quarter results. The increasing costs borne by Molina, as members reached the limits of cost-sharing provisions of their coverage, was also a factor in our poor fourth quarter performance. The share of total member pharmacy costs borne by the company, for example, increased from 82% in January of 2016 to 88% by December. Marketplace medical cost trend was 4% for the year, but the per-member per-month costs spiked in December. Of course, the risk corridor program of the Affordable Care Act was designed to partially mitigate the damages of situations like ours. As all of you know, the federal government has not met its obligations under the risk corridor program, and we have not recognized any benefit from this program in the results we are sharing today. Nevertheless, we are pursuing collection of the amounts due us as part of that program. To support our belief that we're entitled to the risk corridor payments, consider that Judge Thomas Wheeler recently ruled that the federal government is liable to Moda Health for all unpaid risk corridor payments. This gives Molina reason for optimism as the facts in our lawsuit are similar to those in the Moda Health case. The $140 million owed to Molina for risk corridor payments, if realized, would give a truer picture of the financial results of the Marketplace program. Leaving the Marketplace and looking at our business as a whole, our total premium revenue for the year was up 23% from 2015 with year-over-year increases in all programs. It's important to note that nearly 75% of all new premium revenue came from programs other than the Marketplace. I want to emphasize that margins in our TANF, ABD and Medicare programs improved in 2016 over 2015. To put it another way, our traditional business lines of Medicaid and Medicare are improving, despite the deterioration we experienced in Marketplace. Our management of administrative expenses also improved in 2016. Our general and administrative expense ratio decreased to 7.9% for the full year 2016 compared to 8.1% in 2015. Finally, at December 31, 2016, days and claims payable was flat sequentially at 47 days. And the company had cash and investments of nearly $4.6 billion, including an excess of $260 million at the parent company. As disclosed Tuesday, the termination of our purchase agreements with Aetna and Humana will result in a $75 million breakup fee, which we will recognize in the first quarter of 2017. As a reminder, we will be hosting our Investor Day conference in New York City tomorrow, Thursday, February 16, at 12:30 PM Eastern Time. At that presentation, we will be discussing the company's outlook and strategy for 2017. We look forward to seeing you there. If you're not able to attend in person, we encourage you to join the webcast. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions on the quarter and the year, but we'll save questions on our outlook for tomorrow's call.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. Hello, everybody. I'm sure there'll be plenty of discussion about the Marketplace, but I thought I might ask you about some of the other states that you're flagging here. It sounds like more on the Medicaid side, I think you're flagging Ohio which it look like was an issue early in the year, but it sounds like that was turning around, and now, it sounds like the MLR increased 310 basis points. Can you tell us what's going on with that? Any update on – maybe a little more flavor on Puerto Rico? And then, Texas is one you've talked about but it didn't – wasn't flagged today. Any update on what you're seeing there?
John C. Molina, JD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure, A.J. So, on the Medicaid side, we did talk about Ohio early in the year. The first quarter was a bit rocky for us. And then, we were able to bring the medical cost down in Q2 and Q3. I think that in Q4, it's just normal seasonality as opposed to anything else. In Puerto Rico, we did again flag that early in the year, and have had some very good results in improving the profitability of the Puerto Rico plan. Texas, again, we cited early, but the Texas issues again are largely behind us.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks. I guess with the exchange business, if you could go into the little detail about the other items. I guess, there was a $35 million favorable number. What was that related to? And then, I think you said that you would look at exchange in a state-by-state basis. Are there any state exchange products that were profitable in 2016?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hi. It's Joe speaking. To your first question, that $35 million variance from pricing is a combination of things. It's lower admin costs than we anticipated plus a little bit more revenue around some other aspects of the program, in total, it added up to about $35 million. Regarding the individual state performance, we don't normally give that, but I can speak to Texas particularly as being a state where we're doing relatively well on the Marketplace program. We feel really good about Texas. Florida is hanging in there. California hanging in there. So there's three states.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Actually, just to clarify that, SG&A will be a little bit lower. The number – is that like a bonus accrual? Like earlier we had like Anthem report worse numbers.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Oh, no. It's just about the usual things, commissions, just allocation of admin costs, things like that.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. All right. Great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dave Styblo with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Sure. Thanks for taking (26:27) the questions. Maybe just to circle back to the exchange and then understand better the pressure, it looks like there's about $1.20 of pressure in full year 2016. Is that sort of the right way to think about it? At the end of the day, you were not able to participate and ultimately had to exit. Is that earnings release that we would think about on 2016 or are there some other puts and takes? And also, I'd like to ask about perhaps any negative SG&A leverage that might be associated with that.
John C. Molina, JD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure, Dave. I want to be careful, because when you ask what would happen if we got out, we're beginning to get into forward-looking guidance type of things. But the way that you described – the way I would say, the puts and takes for Marketplace, it really relates to the risk transfer. If you look at that, we ended up transferring $350 million in excess of what we priced it at. Now, if the risk transfer methodology were structured in a more accurate way, you would expect almost a one for one decrease in medical expenses, idea being you would have helped your members, so their costs would be lower. But in fact, our costs were only $120 million lower than pricing. So that differential really speaks to where the miss comes in the Marketplace.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And then, on a CMS release today, they talked about some of the exchange rules, and I didn't get a chance to fully look through that being on the road today. Was there anything in there that really meaningfully will help you on that? I don't think I saw on the quick headlines there was anything on the risk adjusters there, but curious to hear your takes and thoughts about rules around Special Enrollment Period, and what they did right, and got right that should help you versus what else you need besides what you've discussed earlier about the risk transfers?
Joseph Mario Molina, MD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hi. This is Mario. We're going to discuss that tomorrow during our outlook discussion. But I do think it is a positive step, but it's not going to solve the really big issue that we have which is risk transfer. It addresses a number of other things and we'll go over those tomorrow.
David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead with your question.
Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. I realize that HIQ (29:17) is fluid, so I'd rather focus on the core. You've been talking about high acuity numbers, ABD and MMP contracts continuing to mature towards a run rate in 2016. And if I look at the timing of contract wins that make sense, I can see an absolute improvement on year-over-year MLR, but I'm wondering about the pace. So is MLR on the new high acuity membership, I guess, those gained over the last, call it, two years or so, both ABD and MMP improving at the pace that you would have expected? How long do you think is the path to normal margins on that book? And do you still think that ABD and MMP is 1.5% to 2% net margin business?
John C. Molina, JD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: That's a great question, Sarah. I would say that we are progressing along the plane that we wanted to for the higher acuity members. We did have a bit of a hiccup, for example, in Washington, when we rolled out the integrated program down in Southwest Washington. I think the state and the state's actuaries realized that they mispriced that business somewhat, and we've been working with them to correct that. But the medical management efforts that Dr. Wilson and his team have put in place have really stabilized utilization, brought it down, and we do think that we're making good progress.
Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. And then just a clarification. You mentioned in the press release some rate pressure being reversed in January 2017. I'm just wondering if that was specific to the fourth quarter, because it's a bit unusual to talk about rate pressure so late in the year for the rate resets. So if you could clarify that a little bit more.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sarah, it's Joe speaking. What we were just tried to point out there is that, in those three states, where we have seen some margin pressure – Ohio, Illinois and Washington – we did receive some pretty decent rate increases effective January 1, 2017, which we'll go into more detail tomorrow. But I would just say that in today's state funding environment, you generally don't get 4% to 5% rate increases without there being some pressure on margins.
Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink. Please go ahead with your question.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Yeah. Okay. Thanks. The first question is around Medicaid expansion. It does look like you had a pretty big sequential MLR increase just on our early read of this as opposed to TANF and CHIP. I'm just trying to understand what's going on there. And you talked about December being the pressure point, was that flu and more cost-related or something else? And does that a big contributor in the deterioration in loss ratio in some of the states that you had, Ohio, California, Illinois, Q-over-Q?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, Ana, it's Joe speaking. Two points I'd make about Medicaid expansion. First, as we spoke about in the first quarter, just we started this year with rates on Medicaid expansion coming down, which lowered margins. We also – if you recall, we had a Medicaid expansion rate cut in California mid-year. The additional item that's happened regarding expansion in the fourth quarter is our determination that we were going to have to take a charge of about $40 million, $45 million out-of-period related to an item in New Mexico involving contractual interpretations on our Medicaid expansion contract.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: So, that was the only reason is New Mexico, wasn't anything you saw in some of the other states I just talked about that had the issue?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No. Again, as far as Medicaid expansion, the big dip really took place January 1 of 2016 when new rates rolled in.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay. So, you still maintain that the worst of the rate pressure is behind us and you're not going to see pressure going forward on expansion?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. I think we're certainly seeing – we'll talk more about this tomorrow. We've actually seen a little bit of relief in Washington. I think our point would be our – as you would probably be that over time, as the Fed stops funding expansion so much that those margins are probably going to approach the TANF and ABD margins, which is why we're so pleased with the progress we have made this year in TANF and ABD.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Then, on the exchanges, if I could get a little bit more clarity around, you talk about the risk (34:20) which I'm assuming is risk adjusters and those seem to have come in a lot worse than expected. And then, you talk about risk corridors not delivering and you saw some cost pressures, but you didn't see the relief from risk corridors. Can you talk about what percentage of the miss with risk adjusters relative to risk corridors? And I understand Moda might have won the case and all, but that's a lot more dicey, right, than risk adjusters?
Joseph Mario Molina, MD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: So, this is Mario. First of all, on the risk corridor issue, we do believe that we are owed the money, and our case is very similar to the one that was filed by Moda, so we do believe that we'll prevail in that. The biggest single problem we have, and we started saying this earlier in the year, is the risk corridor methodology. The fact that we are a plan that has relatively low premiums, relative to the state-wide average, really hurts us. And to give you an example, in California where we operate only in Southern California, the costs in Northern California are about 30% higher, so it drags up the statewide average and further magnifies the problems that we have. The basic problem that we have today and going forward is around risk transfer. I think the secondary problem is the Special Enrollment Period, and perhaps the new regulations will address that. But we need to continue to press for some relief on the risk transfer issue.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: The risk transfer corridors or adjusters or both? I'm still not clear.
Joseph Mario Molina, MD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: There are three Rs. So there's reinsurance, risk corridors and risk transfer. Right now, the first two have gone away, and the risk transfer remains. So, it's going to be a problem going forward, unless something is done, and that's what our advocacy efforts are focused on.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: And if you don't get...
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Ana, I'm sorry. It's Joe. Just to be clear, I think from the terminology you're using, you would relate risk transfer to risk adjustment.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay. Okay. And if you don't get what you have, what you need with advocacy, might you consider exiting for 2018?
Joseph Mario Molina, MD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yes.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the color.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. I just wanted to get a little more color on page 2, and maybe I missed this, and I think Joe White has alluded to one of the items. But items two and three, so when you talk about items – $25 million related to 2014 and 2015, is that prior to your development or is that specific contractual issues? And it sounds like maybe number three was the New Mexico thing you'd just mentioned, but I wanted to clarify.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: That's correct. Both of those items relate to unique issues specific to states, one being the New Mexico item I talked about, the second one being in the state of Illinois, where the state cut back on Medicaid rates and risk adjusted been back to the beginning of 2016. So it's not prior period development issue we think of it in terms of the claims liability. It's specific contractual revenue issues.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it. And the $1.21 per share loss related to Marketplace, that I presume I'm sure that includes the full risk adjustment payment you're talking about. But the PDR impact is also included in that $1.21?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Bear with us for a second. I'm trying to find the $1.21 you're talking about.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I thought you said...
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: (38:33) at the very beginning.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yes. Yes. That is correct. That $1.21 does include the impact of the $30 million PDR.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.
Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey there. So good evening, I guess, for us, and good afternoon to you guys. But your stock is going to be on sale here tomorrow and probably for a little while. Has the management team discussed doing anything like maybe pulling in the share repurchase sometime during the first quarter or discuss the policy like that especially with the breakup fee coming from the Humana deal?
Joseph Mario Molina, MD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hi, Tom. This is Mario. We do have an authorization for share repurchase from the board, but we're not planning to do a share repurchase at this time.
Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So, you don't think that would be something that would maybe support the stock or show some confidence in your planning and everything that you're doing going forward? There's just hasn't been any talk of that at all?
Joseph Mario Molina, MD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No.
Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to the presenters.
Joseph Mario Molina, MD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Well, thank you very much for joining us today. And just a reminder that tomorrow we'll be discussing the outlook for 2017; that will be at the Parker Méridien at 12:30 PM. And, please, join us in person. If you can't, it will be webcast. We look forward to talk with you tomorrow.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Molina Healthcare Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded Thursday, October 27, 2016. I would now like to turn the call over to Juan José Orellana, Senior Vice President of Investors Relations. Please go ahead.
Juan José Orellana - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Ash. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare's financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016. The company's earnings release reporting its results was issued today after the market closed, and it is now posted for viewing on our company website. On the call with me today are Dr. Mario Molina, our CEO; John Molina, our CFO; Terry Bayer, our COO; and Joseph White, our Chief Accounting Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. If you have multiple questions, we ask that you get back in the queue so that others can have an opportunity to ask their questions. Our comments today will contain forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release, and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K Annual Report, our Form 10-Q quarterly reports, and our Form 8-K current reports. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab at our company's website or on the SEC's website. All forward-looking statements made during today's call represent our judgment as of October 27, 2016, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements, except as required by securities laws. This call is being recorded and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available at our company's website, molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina.
Joseph Mario Molina - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Juan José, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We are pleased with the results we reported today. Revenue and enrollment growth remained strong and medical margins across the majority of our products are improving. Today's results provide insights into the operational improvements we have made, as well as some of the challenges that we confront. While we have shared our strategies for addressing some of these challenges in the past, it is helpful to reexamine them by separating them into two categories: those that are specific to Molina and those that are environmental. As we communicated early this year, the internal challenges the company faced included weaker than anticipated operational performance at our Puerto Rico, Ohio and Texas health plans. We're making progress in Puerto Rico. But as we have said in the past, the turnaround there will take some time, given our recent entry into the market and the time needed to benefit from new provider agreements and from our care model. In contrast, our interventions at our more established Ohio and Texas health plans have yielded significant operational improvements, enabling us to overcome the challenges we discussed earlier this year. In addition to the improvements that we have made at specific health plans, we continue to upgrade our technology. During the third quarter, we upgraded the newer version of our existing enterprise core administration platform across 12 health plans. The upgrade allows us to continue to accommodate growth and increase administrative efficiency, while adapting to changing compliance and other business requirements. The second category of challenges includes environmental or external matters. The most significant of these challenges involve the Affordable Care Act's insurance marketplaces. Before I discuss these challenges further, we should not lose sight of the fact that the Affordable Care Act has been successful in providing health insurance coverage to 20 million people. We have always believed that participation in the health insurance marketplace is directly aligned with the Molina mission to provide healthcare to people receiving government assistance. The fact that we've enrolled over 550,000 marketplace members today confirms that many Americans value the combination of affordable and quality healthcare that Molina offers. Notwithstanding all of its benefits, however, the health insurance marketplace has suffered from its share of growing pains. I want to emphasize that no undertaking of this complexity and size is ever implemented perfectly. My remarks today are not meant to condemn a valuable and much-needed program. The marketplaces are generally performing well. They only require modification and adjustment, not wholesale change. We believe that risk transfer is one aspect of the marketplaces that requires immediate attention. Because this is the first iteration of the risk transfer process, we should not be surprised that it needs fine-tuning. Specifically, the marketplaces must modify their risk-transfer methodology so that low-cost and low-premium insurers are not penalized. The goal of the risk-transfer program is to encourage health plans to compete based on the value and efficiency of their services rather than by attracting healthier enrollees. This is a laudable and necessary goal, which we at Molina support. But we must be sure that the risk-transfer methodology used does not interfere with the equally laudable and necessary goal of affordable quality healthcare. As outlined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in the Federal Register, the intent of the Affordable Care Act's use of risk adjustment was to reflect health risk, not other cost differences. The key weakness of the current marketplace risk-transfer methodology is that it redistributes dollars among health plans based on total premiums, not health risk. To understand this, we need to briefly describe the mechanics behind marketplace risk transfer. Risk scores are determined for each health plan, based upon the documented health status of that specific plan's membership. Risk transfer is accomplished when health plans with risk scores below 1 transfer money to help plans with risk scores above 1. Payments are calculated by multiplying each individual health plan's relative risk score by the state-wide average premium. But since premiums include medical and administrative costs, any transfer payment is based in part on non-medical costs captured in the state-wide average premium. This is in conflict with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' stated intent. Using premiums in the calculation rather than medical costs creates two distortions. First, the application of risk scores to premiums inappropriately transfers funds based in part on costs that are not medical in nature. Second, the use of a state-wide average premium also discourages health plans from lowering premiums. In order to offset risk-transfer payment in the future, plans have an incentive to increase premiums. In other words, if a health plan was to cut its premium, its risk profile remained the same and the average state-wide premium increased, it would owe more in risk-transfer payments in the following year. Fortunately, a risk-transfer fix can be implemented by simply modifying the transfer formula so that premium is adjusted based on 80% of the premium rather than 100% of the premium. This 20% reduction to the premium base would correlate with the statutory minimum medical loss ratio of 80%, as required by the Affordable Care Act. On October 6, we documented our concerns in a comment letter to CMS. Remember, the financial impact of spiraling premium increases will be borne not only by the insured, but also by the federal government and taxpayers because of associated higher premium subsidies. Currently, about 25% of Molina's marketplace premiums flow back to the government and then on to our competitors as part of the risk-transfer process. For the 2015 benefit year, our risk-transfer payments were approximately $254 million. And so far this year, we have accrued $372 million for the 2016 benefit year. As a result of this flawed risk-transfer methodology, we may be forced to curtail our marketing in certain marketplace states. I used the word curtail rather than terminate, because we remain committed to working with the government to create a competitive, stable and sustainable environment for the marketplaces. In addition to marketplace, another developing story is that of our proposed acquisition of the assets being divested from Aetna and Humana as a result of their proposed merger. This is a great opportunity for Molina to add scale to our Medicare Advantage offering. However, due to its ongoing nature, we cannot comment further. It is important to note that Molina has more than 10 years of experience in serving the most difficult of Medicare members, the dual eligibles. We are pleased that our Medicare plan in New Mexico has achieved a four-star rating. In addition, our Florida health plan improved to three-and-a-half stars and achieved a commendable rating from NCQA. This improvement to our star scores is no small feat. CMS and the publication Health Affairs have reported that social determinants of health impact star scores. I want to congratulate our health plans on their success on improving measurable quality. Great job. As a reminder, we closed on the Total Care acquisition in New York and began reporting on that business during the third quarter. We feel good about the prospects for this New York business as well as its long-term strategic value in one of the top-five markets for government programs in the country. Finally, I wanted to congratulate Molina Medicaid Solutions on two recent accomplishments. First, on October 6, our MMIS system in West Virginia was certified by CMS. West Virginia is the first state to fully participate in a new rigorous certification protocol. CMS cited West Virginia for successfully implementing an MMIS system on schedule and on budget. I would like to congratulate the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources as well as our team for accomplishing this significant achievement. Second, the State of Louisiana has extended our MMIS contract for another year, and we welcome the opportunity to continue to work with the state in 2017. That concludes my remarks. With that, I will turn the call over to John for a look at our financial performance in greater detail.
John C. Molina, JD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Mario. Good afternoon, everyone. Today we reported net income per diluted share of $0.76 in the third quarter, compared to $0.58 in the second quarter of 2016. On an adjusted basis, which we believe to be a more meaningful measure of our earnings, we reported $0.85 this quarter, up from $0.67 during the previous quarter. Revenue increased to $4.5 billion for the quarter and to nearly $13.5 billion for the first nine months of this year. As Mario discussed earlier, we have worked diligently on the issues we outlined during the first quarter, and we have overcome many of those challenges. Compared to the first and second quarters of this year, the results we reported today are relatively free of out-of-period adjustments. This makes the discussion of the results we reported today relatively straightforward. Put very simply, our Medicaid and Medicare businesses are doing better, but marketplace has lagged. I think the key points to draw from in the results that we issued today are the following: First, our business is headed in the right direction. Utilization of medical care services is trending downwards, and the issues we experienced earlier this year in Ohio and Texas are substantially behind us. And results in Puerto Rico, while still not where we want them to be, are improving. If we remove out-of-period revenue adjustments for Puerto Rico and Texas from our second quarter results, we see that our medical care ratio for all of our businesses combined, excluding marketplace, decreased by 70 basis points from the second quarter of this year. Second, we continued to benefit from greater administrative cost efficiency. Our general and administrative expense ratio dropped 50 basis points during the third quarter to 7.6%. This decline is partially the result of lowering advertising and broker expenses, and we will see higher G&A expense in the fourth quarter as open enrollment and advertising ramp up. Nevertheless, we are on track to finish 2016 with a full-year G&A ratio well below 8%. Third, the benefits of geographic and product diversification are real. If you study the health plan and product information in our earnings release, you will see that different states and different products often support earnings when other states and products experience financial challenges. This is why geographic and product diversification, for example our New York acquisition and our proposed Medicare transaction, are so important. This is why we stay the course in markets like Puerto Rico when other health plans might consider leaving. The ACA marketplaces provide us with a long-term opportunity for continued diversification that is consistent with the Molina mission. 20 million Americans have health insurance today as a result of the Affordable Care Act. Today, we provide affordable and quality health care to over 550,000 marketplace members, making us one of the top-10 largest marketplace providers. It is important to present the financial challenges we face in the marketplace into the proper perspective. By excluding adjustments made in 2016 that relate to dates of service in 2015, we can get a better sense for what the pure period performance is for the marketplace. Following this approach, the medical care ratio for the marketplace program increased to 89% in the third quarter from 80% in the second quarter. On our last call, we told you that we expected marketplace performance to deteriorate during the second half of this year. We expected lower financial performance as a result of normal membership attrition, the addition of higher-cost members through the special enrollment process, higher costs as members reach the limits of cost-sharing provisions of their coverage, and increasing utilization as members become more engaged with our care networks. All of those things happened, but they do not tell the whole story. We also recorded higher-than-expected risk-transfer liabilities in the quarter, which further reduced our premiums and our margins. As Mario said, we believe that the methodology used to calculate marketplace risk-transfer payments penalizes efficient and affordable health plans like Molina. And, as a result, those purchasing affordable marketplace policies ultimately pay higher premiums. Currently, about 25% of Molina's marketplace premiums flow back to the government and then on to our competitors as part of the risk-transfer process. For the 2015 benefit year, risk transfer payments paid by Molina were approximately $254 million. And so far this year, we have accrued $372 million for the 2016 benefit year due. If the risk-transfer formula were modified so that the state-wide average premium is reduced by 20% to reflect the minimal medical cost floor of the ACA, only 20% of our marketplace premiums would be transferred to competitors, and our liability at September 30 would have been reduced by $75 million. Nevertheless, we believe that marketplace performance for the full-year 2016 will be approximately breakeven, that is for 2016 dates of service. We continue to be cautiously optimistic that our marketplace business will generate after-tax margins consistent with the rest of our business for 2017. As Mario discussed, we remain actively engaged in improving the risk-transfer payments and the risk-sharing methodology. Turning to our balance sheet. As of September 30, 2016, the company had cash and investments of more than $4.6 billion, including almost $390 million at the parent company. Days and claims payable came down 1 day sequentially to 47 days. As a reminder, we do not provide quarterly guidance. As we have said repeatedly during past calls, we adjust guidance only when we believe there is a material change to the business from what we have previously communicated. There have been no material changes to our business since we issued revised guidance in April, and therefore, we are not making any adjustments to our 2016 guidance at this time. We have decided to wait until February of 2017 to host our next Investor Day. We strive to provide investors with relevant and quality information. However, we felt that the timing of this late fall potential conference combined with a lack of visibility into key events, such as the U.S. presidential election, a decision on the Aetna-Humana merger and greater clarity on marketplace risk transfer made it more prudent to wait. This concludes our prepared remarks. Ash, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of A. J. Rice with UBS. You may proceed with your question.
A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. Hello, everybody. I understand not wanting to speculate on what's happening at Humana and Aetna. But just from Molina's thinking about being ready to take on this if the deal were to be approved, it sounds like it would all happen very quickly in January. Do you have to make any spending investment? Is there something we should think about in terms of contingency that you're likely to need to invest either late this year or early next year as you start to consider that until you get a decision?
Joseph Mario Molina - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: As we've previously said, we're not going to discuss the transaction.
A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. But even if the transaction doesn't go through, do you have to do any spending that we should think about for the fourth quarter or anything?
Joseph Mario Molina - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, this is Mario. We mentioned that we will see an uptick in costs related to the open enrollment period around marketing, advertising, broker commissions.
A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. All right. And then, maybe just for my follow-up then. On the commentary around the exchanges, we appreciate that. I'm just trying to understand if your hope is to get to a target margin for next year, is that based on rate increases that you can foresee in your assumptions about where enrollment would be? Or is it contingent upon getting some changes in the risk adjusters?
John C. Molina, JD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: This is John, A.J. No. We didn't price any changes to the risk-adjustment methodology into 2017. It's a combination of price increases and better medical management.
A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.
Christopher Benassi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Congrats on the quarter. This is Chris Benassi on for Matthew Borsch. Could you elaborate on where you're seeing pressure in the marketplace? And is this consistent with prior-year trends such as member churn and the SEPs? Or is this a more accelerated development? Thank you.
John C. Molina, JD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: It really is along the lines of the four items that I've pointed out, which is attrition, higher cost for the SEP, people running out of their risk sharing and their out-of-pocket costs, and then increasing utilization as people become more familiar with our networks and seek care. It's not widespread. We are in the marketplace in a number of states and we have very good results in a number of those states. And for this quarter, we were hit with an adjustment to our risk adjustment liability of about $30 million that came from a catch-up, so to speak, as we get more information in from the outside actuaries. But I would say that we have a couple of markets that aren't doing well and we have a number of markets that are doing better.
Christopher Benassi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. And just kind of one quick follow-up to that. Are you seeing less churn? Or have you seen any incremental improvement from the SEP measures that were implemented? Just trying to kind of dig a little deeper there. Thanks.
John C. Molina, JD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No. We're not seeing anything significant in terms of changes between 2015 and 2016 in the SEP.
Christopher Benassi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. Appreciate you taking the questions. So, in light of your comments about the marketplace, how do you view your expansion of territory, expansion of offerings and coverage in the marketplace for 2017
Joseph Mario Molina - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hi. This is Mario. We are expanding in a number of counties but staying within our existing states. So we're expanding in Washington, we're expanding in Florida, and we're expanding in California.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: And do those states overlap with the limited areas where you're seeing some challenges that John just alluded to?
Joseph Mario Molina - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No, I wouldn't say that.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Okay.
John C. Molina, JD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I wouldn't either, Dave. This is John.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And then I guess, on Florida, you had listed in the press release a decent price or a decent rate increase there. MLR ticked up pretty significantly. I guess I was intuiting that that might have been marketplace-driven, but it sounds like from that answer that's not the case. So, maybe what is driving Florida cost performance up?
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: It's Joe speaking, Dave. No, I think what's happening in Florida is tied to the marketplace, but I would associate it more with risk adjustment than I would factors that we were anticipating that played out that John listed.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Okay. Thank you for that. I'll drop out. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. You may proceed with your question.
Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Thanks. Just wanted to clarify a comment you made a minute ago, John, on the out-of-period risk adjustments of $30 million. Is that related to service dates in 2015 or is it all in-year?
John C. Molina, JD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: It's all in-year, Chris, but out of quarter.
Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. Okay. And then I guess I'm just trying to – it's still not 100% clear to me whether you're saying that sort of the morbidity of your marketplace membership is trending worse than you thought, or it's simply a function of the risk-adjustment methodology that's – and that is the primary source of the problem right now.
John C. Molina, JD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: That is correct. It is primarily the risk-adjustment methodology. About 20% of that relates to non-medical costs. So you exclude that, and the marketplace for us is great. It's pretty good now, but it gets great at that point. But it's not the morbidity is worse than we thought.
Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. And then last thing, I'm not sure what you're going to be able to say about this, but obviously the EPS range for the fourth quarter is $0.45 wide. Is there any color you can give us around that?
John C. Molina, JD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: You're right, we can't say anything about that.
Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Figured. All right. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink. You may proceed with your question.
Joseph Mario Molina - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Ana?
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Hi. Can you hear me?
John C. Molina, JD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: We can hear you now.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay. Great.
Joseph Mario Molina - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yes. We hear you.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Yes. I wanted to – is it better?
Joseph Mario Molina - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yes. Go ahead, Ana.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Yeah. All right. Okay. So, on the risk adjusters, the first question I had was you talk about this cost versus non-medical cost issue. Is this something that is specific to the managed Medicaid MCOs? And as a sub-lobby, if you will, have you all compared notes and are you seeing similar issues on the risk adjusters at all?
Joseph Mario Molina - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: So this is Mario. This really we believe is the flaw in the methodology. It's not consistent with the stated intention of risk adjustment, as published in the Federal Register. I'm not sure what the other plans are seeing, but I think that this is a generalized phenomenon regardless of the plans. And we made our comments to CMS in a comment letter that was submitted October 6.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: And is this got anything to do with the level of quoting one plan is doing relative to the others? I've heard that anecdotally, in the marketplace, there are certain plans that have had to write large checks with big balance sheet coffered names like Empire and Anthem and all kind of think that it's a coding issue.
Joseph Mario Molina - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No. We think this is a flaw in the methodology.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay. Then, finally, the same question on the risk methodology, you had put out a press release, and this was right after CMS talked about the prescription drugs being included in the risk adjuster and a more, I guess, fair or something of that nature spread on the risk adjusters across various plans. So what prompted you to put that press release out? And were you viewing this as a positive thing? Or just any change is better than status quo, or something else?
Joseph Mario Molina - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: This is Mario. No. We believe that was a positive change. Again, getting back to our comments today, the risk adjustment should be a reflection of the health status of the members. And we think that including pharmacy data is definitely a step in the right direction. Nevertheless, we think the underlying methodology is still flawed and needs to be corrected. This needs to really reflect health risk assessment and not total premium cost.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay. I'll queue up again. I had other questions. Thanks.
John C. Molina, JD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Ana.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed with your question.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks. Just I'd ask a question, I guess, kind of about the Humana deal but I think it's to me you can't answer it because it's more about strategy. Because I guess when other Medicaid companies have said that they didn't really bid on the Humana assets because they wanted to maintain a target to the low-income population. And since you've had a lot of success on the exchanges because you stuck to that low-income threshold, how do you think about targeting Medicare Advantage in the higher income brackets? Is that something that you think is portable? Or is it really still the low-income side that you really want to be targeting?
Joseph Mario Molina - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hi. This is Mario. I think that if you look at Medicare and managed care, it is where Medicaid was a number of years ago. And we think the experience that we've had with Medicaid and with marketplace and with growing our brand and building out our networks will help us compete for Medicare Advantage patients and to grow our Medicare business.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. So it's not necessarily a low-income target. So, I guess, if for whatever reason Aetna-Humana falls apart, we should expect you to continue to be investing money in the Medicare business. That's a business that you want to grow kind of whether or not this deal happens.
Joseph Mario Molina - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: That's correct.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. All right. Thanks.
Operator: Our last question comes as a follow-up from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink. You may proceed with your question.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay. So, on the Ohio and Texas again, what should we think about as the normalized loss ratio for 2017? And in Texas, I thought you had a sequential deterioration. Is that fair? I don't know whether I saw that correctly since the release came pretty recently.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hey, Ana. It's Joe speaking. Yes, there was a deterioration in Texas sequentially, but remember we had that big out-of-period quality pickup revenue...
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: ...last quarter. So, that's a little bit – more than a little bit distorted. Again, as John said, we feel real good about Texas and Ohio. We feel real good about a lot of our health plans right now. But I think the Texas and Ohio numbers for the third quarter of this year are pretty representative.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Joe.
Operator: Apologies. We do have another question from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Thanks for taking the follow-up. So your release talks about the institution of an MLR floor in South Carolina. Your first – and I think effective date of July 1, your first half is below that level. The third quarter jumped significantly above that level. I wondered if the third quarter performance was simply kind of a true-up of that MLR floor? Or if there was deterioration in kind of underlying performance there and how might that floor affect you going forward? Thanks.
Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: It's Joe speaking. There's a little bit more disclosure about South Carolina in our 10-Q, but I'll save you the trouble of looking that up. South Carolina has had some pretty hefty rate increases over the last 12 months, but there have been benefit expansions that went to that. So we expected to see some tightening of margins in South Carolina that would probably take us above the MLR floor of 86% under normal circumstances. And that's okay. That health plan ran at a very low MCR for quite a while and it was running at MCRs that we don't expect to maintain long-term. But, in summary, it's more of a benefit premium issue than it is an MLR floor issue.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: here are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Dr. Molina.
Joseph Mario Molina - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us. We look forward to talking to you in 2017.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Molina Healthcare Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, July 27, 2016. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Juan José Orellana, Senior Vice President of Investors Relations. Please go ahead.
Juan José Orellana - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Marketing: Thank you, Pascal. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare's financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2016. The company issued its earnings release reporting these results today after the market closed, and this release is now posted for viewing on our company website. On the call with me today are Dr. Mario Molina, our CEO; John Molina, our CFO; Terry Bayer, our COO; Joseph White, our Chief Accounting Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. If you have multiple questions, we ask that you get back in the queue so that others can have an opportunity to ask their questions. Our comments today will contain forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release, and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K annual report, our Form 10-Q quarterly reports, and our Form 8-K current reports. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab of our company's website or the SEC's website. All forward-looking statements made during today's call represent our judgment as of July 27, 2016, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements, except as required by securities laws. This call is being recorded and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available at our company's website, molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina.
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Juan José. Thanks to everyone for joining us. I'm pleased to report that the results we published today represent a significant improvement over the first quarter. We earned $33 million in net income, or $0.58 per diluted share, and adjusted net income of $38 million, or $0.67 per diluted share. I call attention to our adjusted net income, because so many of you are now gauging our performance by that metric. We believe that adjusted net income per diluted share is very helpful in assessing our financial performance, because it removes the non-cash amortization of purchased intangibles. Last quarter, we shared with you some specific improvements that we needed to make to our operations. The results we have reported today speak to the progress we have made. We remain confident about Puerto Rico. We continue to improve our information technology and medical management infrastructure. We're making good progress in Texas, and the issues we identified in Ohio in the first quarter are substantially resolved. Now, let me take these in order. First, we told you that progress in Puerto Rico would take time, but we have reasons to be optimistic. While bad news in the Commonwealth continues to capture headlines, many of the underlying developments tell a more positive story. Governor Padilla has argued consistently that payments for essential public services are a priority. There are more than words behind the Governor's commitment. As of today, Puerto Rico is current on its premium payments, and we believe they will continue to make payments on a timely basis. I'm also happy to report that our rate discussions with the Commonwealth have gone well and that we received a rate increase of approximately 2.5% that was effective on July 1. Stepping away from the macroeconomic situation on the island, there remains much that is within our control. We have identified numerous utilization management and provider contracting opportunities in Puerto Rico that give us a great deal of confidence in the future. We also remain vigilant of Zika infection trends in Puerto Rico and are actively contributing to prevention and education efforts on the island. In addition, health officials in Florida are investigating two possible non-travel-related Zika cases. Again, this is not a Medicaid-specific risk, but a general public health threat, and the concern now is a lack of adequate funding to local government agencies to respond to Zika in a comprehensive manner. During the first quarter, we discussed the substantial growth in our enrollment and the stresses that this growth placed upon our information technology and medical management infrastructure. In order to avoid a repeat of what happened in the first quarter, we have re-prioritized and accelerated improvements that were already planned and budgeted for 2016. Costs associated with these enhancements have already been contemplated in our 2016 outlook. Two improvements are worth specific mention. In the area of information technology, we have supplemented our systems with a hyper-converged infrastructure. This software-centric architecture enables us to achieve a greater level of scalability, improved operational efficiency, shorter deployment times, and enhanced security by tightly integrating our computing, storage, and virtualization resources. On the medical management front, we have also selected a new software platform to manage pharmacy and medical care. This effort will further unify our medical and pharmacy clinical management within one platform rather than managing these two functions separately. We also spoke to the utilization management and provider contracting issues that contributed to our problems in Texas during the first quarter. Even without the benefit of the out-of-period quality revenue adjustments that John will talk about in a few minutes, the medical care ratio of the Texas health plan would have been approximately 85.3% in the second quarter. That is well under the 92.8% medical care ratio we reported in the first quarter. We continue to work with local providers in innovative ways to supplement our contracted provider network. We entered into an agreement with Memorial Hermann in Houston to add this prestigious hospital to our network in 2017. Finally, we shared with you our opinion that the problems experienced by our Ohio health plan in the first quarter were transitory in nature. Today's results support that opinion. The medical care ratio of the Ohio health plan decreased to 89.7% in the second quarter of 2016 from 92% in the first quarter. Health plan and corporate staff have worked together to address the root causes of the utilization management issues that contributed to our first-quarter results. We're pleased with our progress to date. This quarter has given us added confidence that we're making use of the right tools and getting the right results. I look forward to updating you again on our progress. I would now like to turn the call over to John.
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Thank you, Mario, and hello, everyone. Today, as Mario said, we reported adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.67 for the second quarter compared to $0.51 per diluted share on an adjusted basis for the first quarter. These results were driven by lower medical costs as reflected by a 60 basis point improvement in our medical care ratio compared to the first quarter. Comparing our year-over-year performance is no longer meaningful given our growth, changes in product mix and acquisition activity. So, I will focus most of this discussion on sequential comparisons. While changes in accounting estimates resulted in several significant out-of-period adjustments during the quarter and for the year-to-date, it is important to note that in total these items only added $0.04 of a benefit to our quarterly results. For the first half of the year, these adjustments were, in fact, a $0.19 drag on our performance. In other words, however important these items might be to a particular geography or program, they were not significant to our consolidated quarterly results. The important facts about the quarter are as follows. As Mario said, we have reasons to be optimistic in Puerto Rico. Effective July 1, we received a 2.5% increase in premiums on the island. We also have multiple medical management and provider contracting opportunities that we are pursuing while we speak. Operationally, we have addressed the infrastructure problems that contributed to our first quarter difficulties. Despite the noise around our 2015 estimate change, we are satisfied with our marketplace performance. Through June 30 of 2016, the medical care ratio of our marketplace business for 2016 dates of service alone is approximately 78%. This accounts for risk adjustment accruals that we're making for calendar year 2016. And we believe that our marketplace pricing for 2017 is adequate. Finally, the primary drivers of our margin improvement resulted from the work that has been accomplished in Ohio and Texas. The medical care ratio in our Ohio health plan decreased by 230 basis points over the first quarter of 2016. Improvement in Texas was even more pronounced. Even without the benefit of out-of-period quality revenue adjustments, the medical care ratio of our Texas health plan was approximately 85.3% in the second quarter, that is well under the 92.8% medical care ratio that we reported in the first quarter. Now, let's quickly review the significant out-of-period adjustments in the second quarter. All of these adjustments are the result of new information we received during the quarter that required us to make changes to our accounting estimates. First, we recorded increased pre-tax income of $51 million or $0.58 per share relating to the recognition of previously-deferred Texas quality revenue. The Texas Department of Health and Human Services notified us this quarter that it would allow health plans to retain all outstanding quality revenue for calendar years 2014 through 2016. Based on that notification, we recognized $51 million of revenue for 2014, 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 that had previously been deferred. Of the $51 million, $44 million related to 2015 and 2014 dates of service, and $7 million related to the first quarter of 2016. As you know, we have been very transparent about the measurement difficulties with this program and the related accounting treatments, which has affected our earnings. We're happy to be able to put this to rest for a while. Second, we recorded a $37 million or $0.42 per share decrease to pre-tax income related to marketplace 2015 dates of service. As a reminder, on June 30, 2016, CMS published its final update on risk transfer and reinsurance payments for the 2015 calendar year, and we adjusted our accruals accordingly. Based on information received in 2016, we now know that our 2015 accruals were light. We continue to refine our accrual methodology as we get more information and believe we are more accurately reserved for the 2016 benefit year. I want to emphasize that our marketplace strategy has been to provide an accessible extension of our Medicaid product to those individuals whose eligibility for Medicaid tends to fluctuate due to variability in their income. Remember, the segment most likely to purchase an exchange product from Molina includes those individuals under 250% of the federal poverty level. Approximately 90% of our marketplace members continue to receive a government subsidy for co-pays and premiums, and it's no coincidence that we have grown significantly in states that have not expanded their Medicaid programs. We continue to have a disciplined approach to our pricing strategy, and we believe that we have adequately priced our marketplace products for 2017. An important consideration as you analyze our marketplace pricing is to compare our pricing with that of other health plans that primarily serve Medicaid members, as opposed to those that primarily serve commercial members. Next, we recorded an $11 million or $0.12 per share decrease to pre-tax income for 2015 dates of service related to Puerto Rico. As disclosed in our 10-Q for the first quarter, this matter arose as a result of enrollment discrepancies between our health plan and the Commonwealth in the early stages of our contract. Let me be clear. We believe that we have a valid claim to all of the premiums withheld. Nevertheless, we reduced premium revenue by $11 million during the second quarter in connection with this matter. The company is affirming its previously-announced earnings outlook. That outlook anticipates earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.15 to $2.60, and adjusted earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.50 to $2.95. We believe that adjusted net income per diluted share is very helpful in assessing our financial performance, because it removes the non-cash amortization of purchased intangibles. Furthermore, we expect our 2016 marketplace margins, measured absent the impact of the 2015 true-ups, to decline significantly during the second half of the year, as a result of four factors. One, we will incur higher costs as members reach the limits of the cost-sharing provisions of their insurance coverage. Two, higher-cost members will be added through the special enrollment period. Three, there will be attrition among lower utilizing members. And four, utilization among new members will increase as they become more engaged with our networks. While we expect our Ohio and Texas health plans will continue to perform well, additional improvement over and above the performance this quarter will be difficult to achieve. In particular, the decline in marketplace margins that we expect in the second half will be especially notable in Texas. Puerto Rico will begin to improve, but slowly and towards the end of the year. Rate increases will provide a modest lift to the second half performance as follows. For Medicaid rates in 2016 and excluding Medicaid expansion, we receive increases of approximately 3% in California and 2.5% in Puerto Rico, both effective July 1, and approximately 3% in Texas effective September 1. For Medicaid expansion rates in 2016, we saw decreases of approximately 11% in California and approximately 2% in Ohio, both effective July 1. Finally, and somewhat related, we saw the implementation of a medical care ratio floor of 86% for the South Carolina Medicaid business effective July 1. At June 30, 2016, days and claims payable were up two days to 48 days from the previous quarter, and cash and investments were in excess of $4.3 billion. Cash flow from operations was $139 million, in line with the prior quarter, and we held more than $465 million in cash and investments at the parent. Finally, we wanted to provide you with ample notice that we are postponing our 2016 fall Investor Day in September in order to have a more meaningful discussion that includes our third quarter results. We've moved that to another date. We will communicate that new date once it has been selected. It was a very good quarter, and I want to thank all of those employees who worked very hard to make it such a success. This concludes our prepared remarks. We're ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Joshua Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good work this quarter, guys. I guess my question is just starting on the marketplace, and you know this sort of – I don't what you want to call it, sort of same-store 78% MLR, excluding all the out-of-period stuff. I guess, I know we've asked this before how is that sustainable, and I know you guys keep producing solid results and you're targeting low income, but we are seeing a lot more pressure sort of across the board. So I'm just curious, are you seeing any of these issues that have been reported by others in terms of chronic cost and dialysis or substance abuse, or any of these other issues? Are any of these factors that you guys are seeing? Is it just you guys were better prepared? I'm curious.
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Josh, this is Mario. Yes, we have seen that, all those things to some extent in our members, just like everyone else. I don't think they were any different in that respect.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So, I guess I'm just curious, like is there – there has been no deterioration, though, in those trends, right? And it sounds like others have seen it. Are you – because you guys have taken on a ton of membership, and I'm just curious, were they previously insured with other carriers and just not new to it? I'm just curious how you guys are doing such a good job here.
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Well, Josh, it's Joe. I would just point out that while we are seeing those conditions as any health plan would, we continue to have, on a risk score basis, comparatively healthier members. We've put aside for 2016 dates of service about $220 million so far this year for payables back to CMS for risk adjustment. So, I guess, I would say that we're not seeing a huge number of chronically ill members.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, Joe, I think you might have just hinted on this, but the CMS update where they said you guys got to catch up a little on your accruals from last year. Did that inform your accruals for 2016? Did you make any catch ups in 2Q as to where you are now?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: In a nutshell, yes.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then just last question from me. On the Texas performance fees, I just want to understand what happened with the state. Did they actually prove out, yes, Molina satisfied all of the requirements to earn these performance fees, or was it just simply the state said, okay, everyone that thinks they're owed money, yeah, we agree at this point? Just it wasn't clear from your comments if there was something specific that you guys achieved that helps you understand how this works or if this was just simply Texas kind of clearing the decks for the last couple of years.
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Josh, this is Mario. Texas suspended the program, and so the revenue that we had not recognized, we were able to recognize. They are going to institute a new program. We are not sure exactly what that will look like yet, and we still have to perform all the quality measures and report those to the state.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So, they sort of capitulated and just told everyone forget about the old program. We're going to start something new and recognize all the revenue that we've previously withheld, basically?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: That's correct.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America – Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks. Just wanted to go into the ramp that your guidance basically assumes for the rest of the year. In the press release, you guys outlined a number of things that were going to kind of inform and drive that improvement. I was wondering if you could maybe try to quantify each one of those buckets between medical management initiatives and rate increases, et cetera.
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: This is Mario. I think we've done that to the best of our ability. We've given you the factors. We've spelled out the rate increases. Beyond that, it's hard to quantify exactly how much each of those initiatives is going to contribute. But we have also told you that the back half of the year is where the lion's share of the profit is coming from this year.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America – Merrill Lynch: So, I guess – so like the first bullet point in your guidance was savings realized from medical management initiatives. Would you say that those in aggregate are a bigger driver to the improvement in earnings than the rate increases are, or – just trying to get order of magnitude?
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Yeah. This is John. Yes, medical management is going to continue to be the biggest profit improvement driver.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America – Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then just trying to understand, you said that from a G&A perspective that you made a number of initiatives around assisted (22:32), et cetera, things that you'd planned for the year, but that you'd accelerated. Does that mean we should expect G&A to be a little bit lower in the back half of the year than it normally would be, because you moved what was supposed to be second half into the first half, or how do we think about modeling G&A as the year goes on?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: It's Joe speaking. Generally, a lot of those kind of expenses we're talking about are capitalized, so they would be reflected in the D&A rate. With that said, though, I would expect that we'll see a little bit of moderating of the G&A rate that you saw this quarter through the second half of the year. Our full-year guidance, I think, is about 7.8% G&A ratio.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America – Merrill Lynch: Okay. Then just last question for me then, the fact that you're postponing the Investor Day until after Q3 results, is there something unique about this year or a lack of visibility, or a catalyst that you're going to get more visibility on in that October timeframe that makes – I guess, theoretically, you've had similar issues in years past, and you've always had the Analyst Day at the same time. What was the – what are you going to get by delaying it by a couple of months? Is there something specific you're looking for?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Kevin, you're right. We've had this issue in the past, and we just felt that with the passage of time, we'd be in a better position to talk about things. It's a little awkward to be talking about issues that close to the end of the quarter.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America – Merrill Lynch: Okay. All right. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.
Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hey, guys. Just on Puerto Rico, I just want to make sure I understand sort of the dynamic there at this point. You're going to – or you did get the rate increase earlier this month, but is the improvement at this point largely just going to come from medical management initiatives? And if that is the case, where are the areas that you feel like you were weakest sort of coming into this year and where the greatest improvements will come from?
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: I would say the answer is going to be both medical management and re-contracting, Chris. On the island, the provider groups are more accustomed to taking pharmacy risk than they are, for example, on the mainland. That will become an issue for us as we re-contract with some of the medical groups. In terms of the medical management and what needs to be done additionally, some of the hospitals that we've been dealing with are fairly restrictive in terms of concurrent and prior authorization for admissions. And so, we're working with them to beef up that ability.
Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. And then on the marketplace enrollment – or marketplaces, and the performance there in the second half, I think you mentioned Texas, specifically, as being a pressure point. I could have misheard you, but if that is, indeed, the case, can you give us a sense for what's going on there?
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Well, again, what we said was that Texas is not going to – shouldn't be expected to improve beyond what we did in the second quarter, once you take out the effect of the additional revenue. One of the reasons that Texas had a very good MCR for the second quarter was because the marketplace performed very well in Texas in the quarter, and we're not going to see continued increases in profitability on a percentage basis.
Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. And then just one last follow-up on the marketplace, where do you think the right sort of MCR should be for the year, or just maybe even what are you guys targeting sort of longer term? Thanks a lot.
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: It's Joe. I think, obviously, you have to consider all the stuff we've talked about, about higher admin burden and all of that. But I think an 83% – 82%, 83% for the year might be okay. 80% to 82%.
Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thank you, and congrats on the strong quarter. And I appreciate the level of detail you provided in the release. It makes things very clear. I wanted to talk a little bit about earnings progression. So, last quarter, on the call, you thought two-thirds of earnings would come in the back half, but this would put you guys above current guidance. So, should we think about there being some conservatism in guidance right now, or did some of the cost improvements in Ohio and Texas resolve faster than you'd previously anticipated?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Hi, Sarah. It's Joe. Let me give a technical answer to caution everybody. Then Mario and John may have something to say more strategic. First of all, be careful extrapolating on anything per share related. We're at about 38% for the first half, at the midpoint of our pre-tax guidance. Remember, obviously, the share count is going to fluctuate depending on where our share price goes. So I don't think earning 38% of pre-tax through second quarter really contradicts saying about two-thirds of our income is going to come in the second half. So, I think we're being pretty consistent on that. Obviously, we hope to spend the second half of the year developing the medical management initiatives and the other initiatives we've talked about to drive sustained profitability into 2017.
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Yeah, let me just follow-up, Sarah. This is John. I think we've tried to be very consistent with what we've said this year. We're driving towards a 1.5% to 2% margin in Q4 of 2017. That's what we're focused on. And so, the plans that we've put in place are to get us at that point, or to that point, rather. Some of them may take longer. Some of them may catch a hold sooner, and that's what's going to be sort of the delta for 2016 as to where we are in our guidance range. But we're less focused on where we are in the guidance range this year and more, what are we putting in place to hit our commitment for next year.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thank you. I appreciate that. And just to clarify here on Ohio, historically, it's kind of been in the mid-80%s, but I know there's some mix shift going on. It sounded like earlier on the call you thought the majority of the improvement was done. So, should we think about this as the new run rate for Ohio, or is there still more improvement to be had?
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: I think this is probably the new run rate for Ohio.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe just a couple of clarifying questions real quick here. On the comment about the 82% to 83% general MCR in the exchanges, I'm guessing that puts you solidly profitable on the exchanges this year. When you think about going forward in 2017, as you've said you've addressed what you've seen in the bids, are you thinking that you will maintain profitability or are you thinking you can improve it further from here? And I just wondered on the exchanges as well, is that – I can't tell from the comments, are you – is this the margin you thought you were going to have when you came into the year, or is the margin a little compressed versus what you thought when you came into the year?
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: This is John. The margin is tracking about what we thought, about what we've priced at. Remember, as we said, the back half of the year is going to be more challenging from a profitability standpoint on the marketplace for those four reasons that I identified.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Right.
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: And we think that for 2017, the margins are going to be similar to our Medicaid business.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And then, just to clarify on Puerto Rico, I know last time – and I think you touched on it maybe in response to Chris's question, but last time you said that one of the big issues was around branded versus generic and maybe some cross-incentives there between what the government wanted and what was potentially best in terms of long-term costs dynamics. It sounds like you're working through trying to address those incentives for the physician to prescribe the generic, et cetera. How long do you think that takes to make that adjustment? When would you expect to see us benefit from that? And how might big might that aspect of the issue of Puerto Rico will be in terms of its impact on your results?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: A.J., this is Mario. It's hard for me to quantify how big the impact will be. But I can tell you that we have put a pharmacy management program in place that's somewhat similar to what we use in other states and we're trying to get doctors to convert from more-expensive drugs to equivalent drugs that are lower in cost. At the same time, there are re-contracting efforts underway to give them some risk on the pharmacy side to give them an incentive to use generic drugs. That's going to take place over the course of the rest of the year, I think.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. But when you go into 2017, you think you'll pretty much have in that into place?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think we will have improvement. I'm not sure exactly how much it will be in place at that point, but there will definitely be an improvement. And I think the state also acknowledged in the negotiations with us that the pharmacy costs had come in higher than they had anticipated as well. It wasn't just us, but I think the whole program seemed a little bit higher than they anticipated.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good afternoon. So I just wanted to follow-up a little bit on your MLR guidance from last quarter, assuming that's still in place. It kind of implies a step-down both sequentially and, obviously, versus the first half, but you guys have just told us marketplace is actually going to get a little worse, Ohio and Texas are stable. So, what's really going to be driving a lot of that step-down there as the rate increases in other states, there's general cost-containment in the other states? What's moving the MLRs lower for the rest of the year.
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Hi. It's Joe speaking. I mean, couple of points. The rate increases we've talked about are going to be a definite help. They're obviously directed at TANF and ABD. So we should see some sequential improvement in TANF and ABD margins, which given their relative size is going to offset anything happening in marketplace. So, that's really where you should look for it.
Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So it's kind of broad based any place we kind of got rate increases?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Yeah.
Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay.
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: I mean, you just have to look at relative scale of the ABD and TANF to our business, and it's very substantial. Yeah.
Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, Texas quality, so you recognize this taking $7 million – taking last year out $7 million in the first quarter, do you also recognize $7 million in the second quarter? And are we assuming that it's $7 million every quarter for the year for 2016? How that kind of compare to the original assumption, back at the Analyst Day where I think you guys assumed 75% of total quality revenues, would be kind of realized there? And then lastly, understanding the Texas program is changing, do you think we should be assuming those 2016 numbers are, to some extent, going to continue in some form next year as we probably put a haircut on it, thinking going forward?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: It's Joe speaking. Compared to guidance for the back half of the year, it's probably closer to, yeah, $3 million, $3 million a quarter incremental. The states communication to us suggested that they're – that the program would not be resumed until 2018, but obviously they have the right to set the program how they want to. So, we'll have to see how that develops later. But the most-recent communication from the states said there would be no program in 2017.
Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So does that – so, what are you expecting to be total revenues related to 2016 that you're going to recognize in 2016?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: I mean the total – previously, the program had been $35 million to $40 million a year and we anticipated recognizing – I want to say, I think we talked about at Investor Day – maybe 70% of that. So, the difference of that would be to pick up.
Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much.
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink. Please go ahead.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Good evening. The first question was just on Ohio. I'm really glad you got the MLR down. Can you give us some color on what exactly was the approach taken? You had talked about systems capacity issues in Ohio more broadly and clinical staffing issues, and some of the standards you had on prior authorization. Is that all pretty much addressed? And can we be confident that there won't be something like this, again, perhaps in another state that is large enough for you to make a difference?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: That's a great question, Ana. And the answer is, yes, those are the things we talked about. Those are things that we did. And we've applied this across the enterprise, not just in Ohio. It's had the biggest impact in Ohio. And I think we're seeing nice results as utilization in the Medicare line of business is starting to come down.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay. So, you're comfortable on that on. On Texas, I had thought also when we spoke last that it was going to be mostly the second-half thing, perhaps the contracting maybe with hospitalist contracts as well on utilization. So, what exactly was undertaken in Texas and that helped so much in the first half of the year, even ex- the Texas quality payments?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think it's all the same things we've talked about. They may have taken hold little faster than we thought in Texas, but we're cautious. It's one quarter. So, we'll keep a close eye on that.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: All right. Then third, on Florida and Michigan, you're running at pretty high MLRs. You did get the rate adjustment in Florida. What type of MLRs should we be baking in on a go-forward basis from a structural perspective and then just for the second half of this year?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Hi, Ana, it's Joe. We get into some of that disclosure on the state-by-state basis in the 10-Q that's been filed. I would take a look at that. Remember that Florida, in particular, had been impacted by the out-of-period marketplace adjustments.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay. Then finally, I think – maybe a couple more. One is on seasonality. As I understand, it is supposed to help you in the second half of the year. So, in terms of earnings progressions, what is the driver of favorable seasonality? It seems like on the health insurance marketplaces, it works against you. So, what is working for you in the second half of the year here?
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: You're right. Ana, this is John. The seasonality, typically when we were more pure Medicaid, the third quarter tends to have the lowest medical care ratio, because you're talking about summer months. However, more and more of our revenue now is coming from marketplace. And as we discussed earlier, the marketplace for the back half of the year has a deterioration in the medical care ratio, because people are eating up through their co-pays and deductibles, and then you've got a bit of adverse selection as folks who aren't utilizing the system drop off because they don't pay the premiums, and you've got people who are qualified to the special enrollment period. Marketplace hasn't been, up until this year, a significant impact on the consolidated business. So, it's been tough for us to see what the impact overall is going to be on seasonality.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: And with the variance that you came out with, I thought you had assumed a significantly higher risk adjuster payable after the first quarter. So, I was a little surprised that you had such a large negative variance on the RRs compared to what the 10-Q might have suggested in the first quarter. I'm not sure if I'm missing something.
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: It's been a tiger by the tail, Anna. And we were getting some information, I want to think, in May was the last likely number we came out with. But suffice to say we've got a lot more information in the second quarter that we didn't have in the first quarter.
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: And the risk adjustment program for the marketplace really is unlike the risk adjustment programs that we have experienced in Medicaid or Medicare. So, it's taken us a while to thoroughly understand a fundamentally-flawed calculation.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Got it. All right. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Thanks. A couple of smaller ones. In the Florida premium adjustment that you show in the press release, I think the view is that that would also perhaps influence or lead into forward-looking rate adjustments. Do you have any greater visibility on that, or are those baked into kind of the overall rate adjustment that you may have already gotten?
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: We haven't received any – this is John. We haven't received any additional information on prospects for our rate increase in Florida effective – I think Florida is September 1, we're waiting to see. Certainly, the fact that they miscalculated the rates for a period of time and have adjusted those upwards will have an impact, as they calculate the rates on a go-forward basis. Just how much of it is, we don't know.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Okay. In California, the Medicaid expansion rate fell, a (42:34) reduction of 11%. I'm curious about how much were you perhaps already against an MLR floor where you were rebating back, such that that doesn't really affect the go-forward profitability, or vice versa, how much does it impact profitability?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: It's Joe speaking. We think we're still within the give back after that change, not by much, but we think we're still there.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Okay. So you still would be in a rebating situation?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Yeah. Very marginally, but yes.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And then, kind of on a different topic. Curious about how the series of acquisitions that the company has done, how have those integrated and how are those performing within the book of business? Not a topic that's come up yet.
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Hi. This is John. I think that they're all in various stages, because they closed on different dates. The plans in Illinois, for instance, closed January and March. But I would say that for the most part they're all performing as expected.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: And Total Care is still expected to close later in the third quarter?
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: We are expecting Total Care to close this year, yes.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And the last question. The marketplace revenue adjustments of $37 million in the quarter, is it possible to give us a sense, geographically, of how those would hit plan so that we can kind of make that adjustment? The Texas and Ohio – or excuse me, Texas and Puerto Rico are easy enough to do, but the marketplace seems like it could affect multiple states.
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Yeah, it's Joe speaking. Obviously, it's going to be most pronounced in Florida, with the majority of it in Wisconsin.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. John, you kind of indicated some confidence around seeing some Puerto Rico improvement by the fourth quarter, maybe not so much in the third quarter. Is that just a function of the timing of provider re-contracting along the lines that you guys spoke about earlier in the conference call, or are there other factors as well?
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: I think that was Mario who expressed the confidence, but I would agree with him. It's probably going to be more fourth quarter than third.
Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And what are – so is it pretty much just the timing of provider contracting, or are there other factors as well?
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: No, that's the big one, provider contracting.
Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. Most of my Qs have been asked. Just had one clarification, just on the California Medicaid expansion rate cut of 11%, how does that compare? I remember at the Investor Day, you had talked about a rate outlook for a 13% cut in January of 2016. Is this essentially replacing that or is this on top of that?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: No. This is Joe speaking. You're correct. That January 2016 was meant to be July.
Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Got it.
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: So, that was...
Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): So, at the time, you were thinking 13% for July and it came in at 11%?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Yeah. Yeah.
Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks, guys. Question on your pricing for 2017 in the marketplace. We've seen your California pricing and it seems, relative to other plans, you're increasing prices a lot less than some of the other plans, suggesting that perhaps you'll pick up some of their membership when people start to price shop. First off, question is, is that what we should expect to see, a much faster growth rate for you guys in California, and is your pricing in California in the marketplaces reflective of what you've done across the country?
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: So, this is John. I don't want to get into too much talking about enrollment for 2017. We went back a number of times and looked at pricing for all of our marketplace products, on a geographic-specific basis. We've factored in changes in our network, changes in utilization, and we thought the competition we would be doing, in order to get a competitive price product for the population we're targeting. And you mentioned California and LA County, we don't have Cedars-Sinai in our network, for example. Not that they're not a fine institution, but they're priced way above what we and our population we're targeting can afford. So, that's how we did it. We wanted to raise prices to protect ourselves against adverse selection as folks drop out. But we also didn't want to have a product that was priced so high that our people couldn't afford it. What happens in 2017 with the ultimate enrollment is going to be a function of education, broker, marketing and folks choosing our networks.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So, was California reflective then of what you've done in another country – in other states, rather?
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Yes.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And so, when I look at the low pricing, relative to others, and others backing out of the marketplaces or raising prices much more dramatically, are you concerned at all that you're going to pick up some of their less-healthy populations and create more of an issue for you guys, going forward?
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: I think if you look at the other Medicaid-focused plans, they're staying in the markets and we're priced competitively with them.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question is from the line of Tommy Carroll with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Very, very nice quarter, like to see it. I think everything – most of my Qs have been asked and answered. One follow-up on from administrative standpoint, just cash at the parent. John, I think you mentioned that. I missed it. If you could just tell us that again. And also wanted to ask about some of the acquisitions that were done in the last 12 months, specifically drill down on a couple of the larger ones, like HealthPlus and Integral. I wonder if you could just make some comments about either one of those, anything of note. Thanks
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Well, Tom, I'm extremely disappointed that you tuned me out. The number of cash at the parent is $465 million. In terms of the acquisitions, Integral is doing very well for us. I think Integral is actually performing better than we initially modeled it. HealthPlus is likewise doing fairly well.
Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So, you would that – you call those two performing better than planned? Is it fair?
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: I would, yes.
Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Very good, very good. And I never tune you out. I think I was doodling or something. Have a good one.
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Thanks.
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Tom.
Operator: Thank you.
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, if there are no questions, we're going to sign off. Thank you very much for attending the call. We look forward to talking to you next quarter.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your line.

Juan José Orellana - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Marketing: Thank you, Pascal. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare's financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016. The company issued its earnings release reporting these results today after the market closed, and this release is now posted for viewing on our company website. On the call with me today are Dr. Mario Molina, our Chief Executive Officer; John Molina, our Chief Financial Officer; and Terry Bayer, our Chief Operating Officer; Joseph White, our Chief Accounting Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. If you have multiple questions, we ask that you get back in the queue so that others can have an opportunity to ask their questions. Our comments today will contain forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release, and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K annual report, our Form 10-Q quarterly reports, and our Form 8-K current reports. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab of our company's website or on the SEC's website. All forward-looking statements made during today's call represent our judgment as of April 28, 2016, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements except as required by securities laws. This call is being recorded and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available at our company's website, molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina.
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Juan José, and thanks to everyone for joining us. As we announced today, Molina Healthcare reported adjusted net income of $29 million or $0.51 per diluted share. Coming off a very strong performance during 2015, we encountered a few challenges that contributed to a disappointing first quarter, and that have caused us to reassess our outlook for the year. We have identified those factors that affected our results. We are working diligently to address them, and we remain confident that we will reach our goal of 1.5% to 2% after-tax margin by the fourth quarter of 2017. John will be discussing our financials for the quarter in greater detail during his remarks. In the meantime, it is important to interpret these results within the context of our current business environment and not to lose sight of our long-term growth and margin goals. With that margin goal in mind, let's review the quarter. Enrollment and revenue growth continue to exceed expectations. Enrollment grew to 4.2 million members for this quarter. That is an increase of about 1.3 million members from the first quarter of last year. Over half of that increase, nearly 700,000 members, occurred in the first quarter of 2016 alone. This is the largest membership gain that we have experienced during sequential quarters in the 35 year history of our company. Our strong revenue growth is the result of a strategy that was well conceived and well executed. But I must acknowledge that two years of hyper growth across multiple geographies and multiple programs has created a bit of a strain this quarter. I'll speak more about that in a minute. Despite that strain due to growth, I am pleased to report that we were successful in decreasing our year-over-year medical costs on a per member per month basis by about 5%, from $306 per member per month to $291 per member per month. Lowering medical costs is what we're supposed to do. In fact, the only way to sustain the increases in health insurance coverage that we as a nation currently enjoy is to lower the cost of medical care. While we were pleased with these improvements, they simply did not offset reductions in per member per month revenue. During that same period, revenue per member per month actually decreased from $345 to $324 per member per month. Lower premium revenue per member per month resulted from much lower Medicaid expansion rates, updated risk adjustment estimates on marketplace and the general failure of Medicaid rates to keep pace with the growing medical care costs. Others in our space have also commented on these headwinds in recent reports. In the end, the decline in per member per month premium revenue outpaced the decline in per member per month medical costs, exerting pressure on our profit margins this quarter. So here is where we stand today. First, we believe that we've achieved the top line growth necessary to reach our 2017 net margin target. We've achieved this top line growth even more quickly than we anticipated. Second, the improvements in our care management systems and practices that are needed to support our future profitability, although not complete, are well underway. Next, we continue to develop new capabilities, while integrating acquired ones like Pathways into our organization. Nevertheless, we are experiencing some of the pains that often come with rapid growth and some symptoms that have to be addressed have emerged. For example, medical costs at our Ohio and Texas health plans were higher than we anticipated. And increased pharmacy costs across the business, but particularly in Puerto Rico, resulted in additional margin pressure. Let me take a minute to talk about each one of these issues. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we anticipated enrollment growth, but our results exceeded even our own projections. Assimilating this membership stretched our operational resources. Accordingly, we've redoubled our efforts around member and provider services, care and utilization management, provider payment and information technology – all areas that felt the strain of rapid growth. When we remember that quality of care and compliance can't be compromised, it becomes clear that some short-term profitability may have to suffer. At our Ohio and Texas health plans, higher than anticipated costs were largely the result of utilization issues that we expect to resolve through a number of ongoing care management initiatives. We've spoken about these initiatives before, but I think it's worth our time to review them again today. In broad terms, these care management initiatives are comprised of a number of areas: First, the application of updated authorization standards and criteria. Second, a greater focus on the management of transitions of care. Third, the use of hospitalists to achieve cost-effective outcomes. Fourth, the use of interdisciplinary care teams to help those with combined physical, behavioral, and social challenges. And fifth, the early identification and effective treatment of those who require or may require complex and expensive care over long periods of time. Our performance in the first quarter requires that we revisit the timing and pace of these initiatives and that we adjust the focus of our efforts towards Ohio and Texas. The other area of concern is pharmacy costs. So far this year, pharmacy costs are above our expectations and rate increases do not seem to be offsetting the full impact. The effect on our business of high-cost specialty drugs is something that we have been combating for the past two years and this cost is still not fully recognized by the government's actuaries. Having addressed the cost drivers in the first quarter results, let me now turn to the future. What do all of the headlines about other insurers exiting the marketplace mean to Molina Healthcare? What is our strategy for the marketplace? Our plan is to stay the course. That is because our strategy and our goals for this product are different from those of many other insurers. Our objective is to provide an accessible extension of our Medicaid product to individuals whose eligibility for Medicaid fluctuates, and we believe that we are successfully doing so. As a reminder, the segment most likely to purchase an exchange project from Molina healthcare are individuals under 250% of the federal poverty level who receive significant government subsidies. Approximately 90% of our marketplace members receive a government subsidy for co-pays and premiums. We have never expected our marketplace product to perform better than our Medicaid business, nor operate at significantly better margins over the long term. After a period extremely rapid growth over the past two years, we expect the remainder of 2016 to be more stable. It should give us a chance to catch our breath as an organization while we continue to build on our current infrastructure. You may recall that back in 2013, in preparation for the anticipated growth in Medicaid expansion, the dual demonstration programs and marketplace we invested in operations and systems. Well, the growth exceeded even our optimistic expectations and we need to once again think about administrative capacity. There are a number of things that we need to do this year in preparation for 2017 and to help us achieve our long-term profit targets. First, we need to continue to supplement our management bench strength with additional talent. Our business continues to evolve by growing larger in scale, introducing new demands and becoming more complex as we add new products and services. Second, we need to continue to refine our expertise in medical management. We must continue to make progress in our provider contracts so that both providers and payers are working together to provide the best possible care for each member. This includes working with hospitals to actively reduce readmissions, while promoting patient safety and quality of care. It will also require us to choose our partners carefully and redefined the traditional relationships between health plans and hospitals. Third, we continue to manage our growth and integrate our newly acquired businesses. We completed a number of in-state acquisitions in 2015 that are being integrated in 2016. While the integration of these new members is relatively simple from an operations standpoint, because we have existing health plans in those states, addressing the financial impacts may not be so simple. For example, many of our new members, including those in marketplace, are coming to us from a fee-for-service environment. Short-term pent-up demand, new care management models and different methods of accessing healthcare services can result in higher costs in the short run. With that said, we believe these integration characteristics are transitory, and as a result, we remain optimistic when it comes to growing our business. We were very pleased to announce last week's acquisition of Total Care, a Medicaid health plan in the Syracuse area. Once approved, this transaction will mark our initial entry into the State of New York. Total Care serves approximately 39,000 members. The acquisition provides us with an established platform for future growth similar to what we experienced in states like Florida, Illinois and Michigan. Now, in light of some of the growing pains we've experienced this quarter, it is important to note that we expect this transition to close in the latter half of this year. By that time, we should have worked through the assimilation of our new members from other acquisitions. We plan to continue to respond to RFPs, as we have previously discussed, primarily to enter new states, especially as they relate to Medicaid long-term services and supports, or MLTSS. Now, let me switch topics and talk about a new healthcare threat in the United States, Zika. I use the term "new" with a touch of irony. Zika was first identified 70 years ago in Africa, and initially it was thought that it did not cause illness in humans. We have certainly learned otherwise as it is spread from Africa to South America and the Caribbean. It definitely causes a rare birth defect, called microcephaly that is associated with small head and abnormal brain development. While very few of the expectant mothers among our membership have contracted the virus, the full financial effects of Zika will not likely be known for several months. We continue to monitor the situation closely. Striving to deliver quality care for our members is our company's DNA. So I want to congratulate our 11 health plans that were awarded the Multicultural Health Care Distinction from the National Committee for Quality Assurance for Medicaid. The Multicultural Health Care Program evaluates how well an organization complies with standards in the following areas – collection of race and ethnicity and language data, provision of language assistance, cultural responsiveness, provision of culturally and linguistically appropriate services and the reduction of healthcare disparities. In keeping with our commitment to quality, all nine of our health plans that offer marketplace products also received the award. I want to personally thank each employee who made this award possible. Finally, neither our first quarter results nor anything else that has happened since we issued our 2016 outlook in February constitute a fundamental change to our business or to our long-term outlook. Enrollment growth this year is trending toward the high end of expectations. The care management and quality of care initiatives we discussed in February continue as planned, and appear to be having an impact as evidenced by the decrease in per member per month medical costs. Our diversification efforts, think of our recent New York acquisition, remain on track. As a result, we remain confident that we will reach our stated goal of an after-tax margin of 1.5% to 2% by the fourth quarter of 2017. I would now like to turn the call over to John.
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Thank you, Mario. Today, we reported adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.51 for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.62 per diluted share on an adjusted basis for the same period last year. While we recognize that these results are disappointing, I want to reiterate what Mario just said, these results give us no reason to doubt our ability to reach our goal of a 1.5% to 2% after-tax margin by the end of 2017. We have executed very well on our initiatives to grow the business. Total revenue increased to $4.3 billion this quarter, an increase of more than $1 billion and more than 30% when compared to the first quarter of 2015. This increase was driven by the nearly 700,000 new members we added, a combination of closed transactions from 2015, and better-than-expected growth in our Marketplace product. Top line revenue growth has also had a positive impact on our administrative cost ratio. Our general and administrative ratio decreased by 30 basis points to 7.8% from both the first quarter of 2015 and the end of last year. We have now closed on all nine acquisitions that we announced during 2015. The last five transactions added more than 250,000 members, or more than $600 million in annualized revenues. That is all well and good, but we know that we need increased profits in addition to increased revenue. So, what made this quarter more challenging than expected? First, fee-for-service costs in Ohio and Texas were higher than we expected. For the most part, this is the result of higher-than-expected utilization. Mario has already outlined the care management initiatives that we expect will resolve this challenge. And second, we continued to see cost pressures relative to the level of our premium rates. Looking at the enterprise as a whole, these cost pressures are particularly acute for the pharmacy benefit. Margin pressure across our states as pharmacy costs have continued to increase this year. Despite high generic utilization, we are seeing pressure from new high cost specialty drugs. A good example of this is what we are experiencing at our Puerto Rico health plan. In Puerto Rico, we had a formulary change that added additional branded drugs to the Medicaid preferred drug list over the course of our contract, which resulted in increased costs and were not anticipated when we negotiated our rates back in the spring of 2015. To help mitigate these changes, we are actively engaged on this issue with the Medicaid agency as part of our annual rate discussions, and we continue to work with providers and make the case for actuarially sound rates to ensure the program remain sustainable. Looking at our operating results today when compared to the outlook we provided back in February, you can see that our consolidated medical care ratio of 89.8% was, for the most of our lines of business, in line and tracking along with that guidance. Our TANF and ABD lines of business are the exceptions. These two areas largely contributed to the sequential medical care ratio increase we saw between this quarter and the fourth quarter of 2015. We continue to believe that while our medical cost assumptions have changed, our revenue and administrative assumptions are in line with previous expectations. And as we look out over our mitigation efforts, we see short, medium, and long-term solutions. Weighing all of these factors, we think it is appropriate to reduce our 2016 earnings outlook. We now expect income before tax to be in the range of $350 million on the low-end to $400 million on the high end compared to our initial guidance of $460 million. Accordingly, we are reducing our 2016 outlook for adjusted earnings per share to $2.50 to $2.95 down from $3.86. Despite this revision to our 2016 outlook, I want to emphasize that we expect to exit 2016 with the trajectory that maintains the progress towards our stated goal of 1.5% to 2% after-tax margin by the fourth quarter of 2017. For the interim, so that you can better model and follow our progress, we anticipate slow progress through the second quarter, with increasing performance in the second half of the year, as the efforts we have outlined bear fruit. We estimate that approximately two-thirds of our earnings will be achieved during the second half of 2016. The key takeaways that despite the challenges we faced during the quarter, we have taken action to minimize the impact on our operations going forward, and we did not lose sight of our longer-term objectives, growth, and margin improvement. We have always maintained that one quarter does not define us. We are focused on the long-term. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for the question. I wanted to clarify on Texas and Ohio, was there an increase in utilization or is it just that utilization is not declining as fast as you had previously expected, given the new medical management programs that were put in place? And how much did the Jan 1 rate update play into this? Because I think Ohio was down 7% on expansion and Texas down 1% overall. Thanks.
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Sarah. This is Mario. Let me comment first on the utilization. I think it's both. I think that we did see increased utilization and we had also expected a greater decrease in utilization from some of our medical cost initiatives. Especially in Texas, I think they've been a little slower to materialize. But they're still in progress and we anticipate that they will continue and will bear fruit throughout the year. I'll let John take the rate issues.
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: So, Sarah, the rate issues certainly magnified the lack of a decline in inpatient utilization especially in Ohio. So, we had two things happening: utilization went up and rates went down. That combined made Ohio a much more challenging market than we anticipated. I would note two other things, the first is, our prior-period development did not indicate that the cost issues in Ohio stretched back into 2015. These were things that happened starting Jan 1 and the second thing is we believe that we have some fixes in that should allow us to start seeing the utilization decline starting in the second quarter.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Were there program changes in Texas or Ohio that drove the utilization, or what was driving it if there was change to the contracts?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think that part of it, we talked about the surge in enrollment that we experienced across the board in the company and I think it was a little bit overwhelming. In order to process all of the prior authorizations, we had relaxed our standards a little bit in the first quarter, but we've added additional bandwidth both in terms of the IT system and personnel. So, we think that, that has played out.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thanks. And last clarification is just on the Puerto Rico rates, I think at Investor Day you guys had in your slides that those were going to update in April. So, are you expecting an imminent update on that rate?
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Sarah, this is John. There is a rate meeting in the next couple of weeks and we expect that July 1, new rates to be implemented.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.
A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Yes. So, just, maybe I'll ask about the public exchanges. Your membership there jumped by about 420,000 but your PMPM looks like it's down about 24%, when most people are talking about raising their PMPM – or trying to at least raise their rates 15%, 20%. I'm just trying to understand what's going on there and is that something that we just have to live with for this year or is there any way to correct that?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Hi, A.J. It's Joe speaking. The bulk of the decrease you see in revenue PMPM from Marketplace year-over-year is just driven by the fact we're getting better factoring in risk adjustments. Obviously, we talked about the fact, we have a comparably healthy population, which means we're going to have relative lower risk scores, which means we're going to be giving money back on risk adjustment. If you look at the MLR for Marketplace, for the first quarter of 2016, you'll see it's consistent with what we've guided to and pretty consistent with last year actually.
A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And then just looking at the TANF and CHIP business, you highlighted that TANF business is an issue but it looks like the actual MCR was down year-to-year at least. Maybe just a little bit more clarification on that?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You're correct – this is Mario, you're correct that the MCRs have come down year-over-year. The problem is that it didn't come down as much as we had anticipated for 2016. And so, in our guidance, we had anticipated further decreases in MCR and utilization. And because of Puerto Rico, Texas, and Ohio, that didn't materialize in the first quarter as we anticipated.
A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: And how much – how big issue was flu for you? Have you been able to quantify that?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I don't think that the flu has been extraordinary this quarter.
A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Yeah. A.J., this is John, the other thing to note about the TANF is that it's less of an impact this year than last. So, we had a greater percentage of TANF members last year, so the decrease in the MCR in 2016 was a bit muted.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the changes in the ABD MCR. Right at your Analyst Day, you were guiding us down 300 basis points. Obviously, it's up year-over-year at this point. Anything worth highlighting there that's particular to that segment?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think that in both the TANF and the ABD lines of business, the increased utilization was primarily on the inpatient side.
Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So, was the higher MCR strictly or completely driven for the ABD just by the increased utilization or was there anything else in there?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No, I think it's primarily increased inpatient utilization.
Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then, going back to sort of pharmacy comments earlier. It sounds like – is it fair to characterize the pressures you saw really as changes driven by the formularies, or was there just a broader increase or anything HCV related or other changes that could have impacted or was it primarily related, as you highlighted, to the changes when drugs were put on your formulary outside your expectations?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So, this is Mario again. I think with regard to the pharmacy costs, it's a combination of two things: increased costs coming from specialty drugs other than those used to treat hepatitis C; and some formulary changes primarily in Florida and in Puerto Rico, where we don't really control the preferred drug list. And they have shifted to include more brand-name drugs. So, we're going to have to with our providers, since we don't really control the formulary, to work on controlling utilization and encouraging the use of generic drugs. That said, our use of generic drugs as an entity, as the whole corporation, remains quite high.
Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good evening, guys. So, first question, just, Ohio is a strange one for me because it doesn't look like there's been much change in membership. So, I know you guys mentioned the rate, but what change in the environment, why all of a sudden is there this uptick in utilization?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Josh, I think there were a number of things that affected Ohio. We've had some turnover in staff, we brought in a lot of new nurses that required a lot of training, and of course, when you're new on the job you're not as effective as you are when you've got more experience. There were some IT issues which we have corrected in terms of adding more bandwidth, so that we can process more authorizations. But as a result some of these things, the staff being less effective and some other issues, we did loosen our prior authorization requirements. And so, we probably authorized things that we might not have authorized in the past, but we felt that, that it was better to err on the side of the patient. And so, that accounts for some of the increased utilization you're seeing there.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: But, Mario, what changed? I mean, it wasn't like there was more membership or more revenues necessarily. So, did you just have a lot of employees leave and you just couldn't fill those roles? Was that what it was?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, we had some management changes. We have a new Chief Medical Officer, new Healthcare Services person, a lot of new nurses. I mentioned we had a tidal wave of membership that affected the systems, and so we had increased system downtime as a result. That's been corrected, but those things in combination created problems and it was especially a problem in Ohio.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, I guess, a similar question just for TANF, this is a population that runs in PMPM around $180; they seem to be less chronic, not as acute. And I guess it's not often that we see these spikes in costs for TANFs. So, I'm curious again was this market related or was the TANF population the one that you relaxed the authorization standards, or why would you see – I get it on the duals and ABD, I just – I'm surprised on the TANF.
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think it's the same thing, Josh. I mean, we were really focused on the Medicare and I think we did a good job with that. I think we were a little overwhelmed with all the new membership and the growing pains strained our ability to manage a lot of our members and it affected the TANF and ABD members disproportionately.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, I guess, next question, just on – did you catch it, right, so day's claims payable is down two days. I know the cash flow was relatively strong. But when you sort of looked at your reserves, are you erring – my understanding is the actuaries give you a range, and are you erring more on the side of caution within that range, or it's just – there's nothing that sort of points to that. So, I'm curious how you feel about the established reserves now?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Hey, Josh, it's Joe speaking. I don't think we saw anything this quarter that led us to think that the reserves at March 31 needed to be particularly strengthened. If you look at the overall trend from 12-31 to 4-15, prior period development on a dollar is very consistent with where it was a year ago. Also, a lot of these issues with authorizations and everything we're talking about in various states that peaked in January and February. So, a lot of those claims have already made their way through the system; we pay very quickly. So, it's not as if there's some – in our opinion, it's not as if there are some issue out there with being aware of claims and their late development. This is almost like a real-time issue in terms of utilization.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, just last question, more I guess for Mario. When you're doing some of this M&A diligence sort of RFP expansion opportunities, is there a component of your process that looks at management time and effort? Do you guys sort of think, okay, if we end up winning this contract or expanding in the marketplace, or bidding on this acquisition, it's going to take X man-hours of management time and do you sort of have a process for that in place?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Josh, I'm going to let John handle that because John is the one that handles most of the M&A work.
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Josh, I don't think that we cut it as finely as what you have mentioned. We've done a lot of acquisitions in the past. I think that the first quarter, we got hit with two things: number one, we did have the integrations of a number of acquisitions, especially in Illinois, we brought on three plans in the first quarter in Illinois; but then on top of that, as someone else noted earlier, we increased our Marketplace membership by more than 200%, I believe. So if it had just been dealing with integrating the acquisitions, probably not an issue, but we had on top of that, a large increase in the marketplace that put an additional strain on the systems and on the people, because we had a lot of people who hadn't been covered before were calling in and looking for help.
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Josh, this is Mario I just want to reemphasize that point. The Marketplace enrollment really exceeded our expectations.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. All right will follow up with the rest. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. First question is just following up on the comments you made about needing to increase your, sort of, capacity and some of the constraints you've had. Have you already work through sort of budgeting how much additional administrative cost you may need to allocate to that in 2016 and 2017? And just wondering if – as you sort of recommit to that long-term net margin target, whether an increased sort of administrative cost profile is contemplated within that?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. This is Mario. I think that a big part of the issue is training. We have brought on additional people. I think that the real answer is we need to be more effective. And so, when you bring in new people, especially in UM, they're not comfortable with the systems, they're not comfortable with the guidelines, they're not as effective as they otherwise would be. So, we think that over time, over the course of the year, the staff will become more effective, the systems will become more effective. We're in the process of implementing some additional UM guidelines which should also help, but that I think is a big part of the issue.
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Scott, this is John. We've also added to the IT infrastructure, so that now we've got the bandwidth or the pipes to allow us to maintain an increase in enrollment without having big glitches or stopgaps.
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. And let me just comment on that too as well. We tested the systems expecting a certain level of enrollment and we exceeded that, and I think that was part of the problem. The growth was just far more than we anticipated.
Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Then I had a second question, and just as it relates to Zika and sort of how you're approaching that in your guidance. Obviously, it's still sort of early stage here, but have you built in an assumption that you'll have additional costs in Puerto Rico on that or reserved for that, or are you still sort of just waiting to see how this plays out and then will factor that in as you get more, I guess, some additional information?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: This is Mario. We have not factored that in at this point. I think we have one patient that we know of who's been infected. Of course, there may be others, but right now we're just watching.
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: And as we mentioned before, we're expecting to get new rates in Puerto Rico effective July 1. And I'm sure that this will have to be addressed in those new rates.
Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And then just one last question. Just on the five health plans that you now recently closed on, how much visibility do you have into sort of the utilization trends in those books? And sort of any updates you can give us on how cost trends have been performing in the acquired businesses.
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: It's Joe speaking. We don't have huge visibility into that. We don't see anything to suggest that they are fundamentally different from our members, but that doesn't – our existing members, that doesn't rule out pent-up demand as we implement our care protocols. So, right now, we don't have huge visibility.
Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.
Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hey, guys. I just want to make sure I understand the comments in the press release about the Medicaid expansion premium rate headwind. That was just to illustrate the year-to-year decline that was not intended to be a surprise rate cut? Is that correct?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: It's Joe speaking. That's absolutely correct. We knew that, if you – we knew about expansion rates just as we knew about the Ohio premium rate decrease. And you can see that, based on our guidance, the expansion number, MCR is coming in pretty much to what we guided to. So, it's purely a year-over-year comparison.
Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. And then, just to flush out sort of what I would describe as infrastructure issues. It's not abundantly clear to me whether this was more like a human error problem, and they were just not – error may be the wrong word, but more of a people problem versus an actual systems problem in that where the systems adequate to handle the new members.
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. This is Mario. Let me say both. I think that additional personnel, new on the job, perhaps a little less effective than they'll be when they're a little bit more experienced, increased pressure on the system. The system was a little slower, again, slowing people's work down. So, I think it was a combination of both. The bandwidth in the IT system has been addressed. I think the experience will come with time for the personnel.
Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brian Wright with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.
Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT: Thanks. Good evening. A couple of questions here. No mention of leap day impact, so was curious about that.
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Hey, Brian. This is Joe. Obviously, in the first quarter of a leap year, you're going to have higher medical costs, probably by about 1% since you have an extra day which would go straight to your bottom line. However, we are subject to the same calendar as everybody else in the business. We knew about that calendar when we set guidance. So, I don't think it's a factor in how the quarter played out versus what we thought.
Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT: Okay. And then do you have, like, on the exchange members, the – a lot of the new exchange members, do you have any sense of your exchange members how many were prior, kind of, Medicaid customers or anything like that for the new people that you're getting?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: I don't think we had that information. That information would be very hard to develop. I'm not aware of anything that would tell us that.
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. The Medicaid agency doesn't share their information with us. We, obviously, aren't getting any kind of claims or history from our new members, so – I mean, the only way you could find that out would be to do some sort of a survey.
Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT: Okay. And then – sorry, I'm sorry I just have a longer list than usual today. Just wanted to be clear, the exchange MLR outlook for the year is still 85% or is that changed any at all?
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Brian, this is John. It hasn't changed and we're looking back at what we gave February.
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: I think you're confusing that with expansion, Brian. We guided Marketplace at 79% to 80%, and that's not changing.
Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT: Oh, sorry, you are right. I looked at the wrong one. Sorry about that. So, you're assuming the same kind of – similar kind of seasonality where it goes down in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. Once you get some experience, you just kind of book it where you thought it would be and then kind of in the second quarter, you kind of really find out, is that a fair way to think about that?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Well, I think I would express it this way as far as recording the expansion MCR, Brian. We're going to book to our pricing until we – unless we see evidence that pricing is not adequate. When you look at both 2014 and 2015 in terms of pure periods, full-year run-outs, those years actually in total played out very close to our pricing. So, we're going to book to pricing this year, until or unless we see evidence that it is not running – it is running above pricing. So, I think what that means is, you'll actually see a slight increase in the MLR as the year develops as we get the special enrollment members and as new members become more familiar with how to access the system.
Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT: Okay. Okay. And then just lastly, on the – any of the – the PMPM issue on the exchange business, is any of that like retro risk adjustment, kind of, changes to 2015?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Yes. Well, a couple of points, I think was A.J. who had that question. I think the appropriate answer to A.J.'s question was, if you look at where we ended up fourth quarter of 2015 on Marketplace PMPM revenue, we're very close, we're little above that, $20 above that for the first quarter of this year. So, I think the appropriate comparison would be where we ended up last year after we pushed through all of the risk adjustment and all of that. And to your other question, yes, we continue to refine our estimates on things like – on items like risk adjustment, reinsurance, CSR reconciliation on the marketplace. I think the best way to express all of that, though, is if you look at this quarter in total, you don't see a big impact from out of period development. Just like I said about on claims, not – in total, much of an impact.
Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT: Okay. So, basically, it was at the levels that you thought it was going to be towards the end of last year, the PMPMs on the exchange business? There was no big – there was like no big risk adjustments getting that much lower relative to what you thought or anything of that nature?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: No. I mean, you saw that happen second – third and fourth quarters last year and I think we've kind of figured it out by now.
Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT: Okay. Thank you. Thank you.
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Yeah. Thanks. Good evening. So, just, again, to reiterate I think a question that came up earlier, the expansion rates were not the negative surprise, correct? You anticipated this and basically your negative surprise, as I'm understanding from the release, is the cost pressure in Ohio and Texas and then potentially on an increase basis in Puerto Rico?
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: That's right. The surprise was the increased cost in Ohio and Texas. We did note the higher MCR in the expansion as a way to explain the differences between Q1 of 2015 and Q1 of 2016, but we had anticipated that. And if you go back to the guidance, that we did talk about that and included that in the guidance deck from February.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: And then on a go-forward basis as far as expansion rates, do you feel comfortable that there will be no more negative surprises going forward and which states are you then – if you could just recap, what states are expecting pressure going forward, if any?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: So, let me try that one first. I think what we're seeing now with expansion, if you look at the MLR, it's starting to approach the TANF and ABD populations and we always said that would happen over time. So, I don't think the cost – the premium pressure I think ultimately – the big drops in premium I think are, for the most part, behind us looking at the MLRs.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay, so that's done. Then on a go-forward basis, to fix this and to get to this 1.5% or 2%, granted it's not happening until the end of next year, so what is the plan of action in Ohio and Texas there to get this...
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Let me underscore something before Mario speaks. We do talk about the 1.5% to 2% at the end of 2017 and I just want to clarify that what we mean is the end. So, it will be the fourth quarter.
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: All right. So, Ana, this is Mario. If you go back to our guidance slide from February, you'll see where we had projected the MLRs by product. And right now, where we're really off is on the Medicaid, TANF, and ADB. So, I mean, the first thing we need to do is, we need to address that issue. I think longer-term, we still think that there is room for improvement on things like LTSS and duals in Medicare, but that's more of a long-term thing. So we're going to continue to work to drive down medical costs. And as I mentioned in my remarks, the only way that this expansion of insurance to more people is going to work, is if health plans like ourselves can continue to drive down cost.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay. And you don't anticipate this issue on our cost to go to some other states? Do feel pretty confident just in these two states or we will be seeing more issues? In other words...
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No, right now we think we've worked through the major issues. And we would anticipate the cost to come down over time. And as a result, the profitability should increase towards the back half of the year.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: And then, finally on the managed Medicaid regulation, is this anything at all to do, is it just a Molina-specific thing or would you be able to use the regulation to improve your rate outlook in any way? And then on Rico funding, the government is looking, I believe, the secretary of BOA just went to Puerto Rico and all that, are you in discussions on what the government might do to help the plans on future costs?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, first of all, in terms of the regulations, you know they're extensive. They're almost 1,500 pages. So, we're still in the process of evaluating them. So, I don't really want to comment on what we think the regs mean until we've had a chance to really thoroughly review them. We did comment on the draft regulations and our comment letters are public, I believe. In terms of Puerto Rico, we are in discussions with them over the rates. So, again, there's really nothing that I can comment on there.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. In thinking about the achievement of the 1.5% to 2% by the end of 2017, I guess, given the setback, your trajectory to that will obviously be steeper. I'm wondering if you have views about where you're now – are you now targeting, say, the low end of that range, where your aspirations might have been higher before. Or another way to come at that might be, at what point in 2016 do you need to see material progress in that direction to believe that those are still achievable?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So, I think that we will see material progress in the third and fourth quarters. And it's a little bit difficult at this point for us to comment on whether we think we're going to be at the high end or the low end of that range. We want to be somewhere between 1.5% and 2% for our profit margin for the fourth quarter of 2017. That's management's commitment. That's what we're driving toward and we still believe that that's an achievable target.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And, Mario, you've talked about the issues and alleviation of a lot of those issues, be it systems or hiring of staff. Have most of the actions or all of the actions been taken at this point and it's a matter of feeling the benefit of the actions or do you still have, for example, management bench to fortify or things like that, that are still needing to be completed?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I would say both. I think that a lot of these initiatives are in-flight. They're in various stages of development in the different states. We will prioritize the rollout of these things in the future depending upon issues like the size of the state or certain medical cost issues. But those things are all launched. There's really nothing that's new that has to be done. It's just a matter of rolling them out across the enterprise and seeing the benefits. In terms of management, I do think we mentioned, we probably need to add some bench strength. I think there are certain key issues around claims and processing of enrollment and premiums, reconciliation, and so forth where we could probably strengthen things a little bit. I don't think it's a matter of hiring a lot of people, I think it's a matter of hiring a few key people.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Okay. My last question, you have, over the course of the call, talked about wanting to continue to respond to RFPs as it relates to, I believe, you were speaking to acquisitions in that context. You've also said that the acquisitions and the number of them put strain on management. I guess I'm curious about your rationale on continuing to kind of pursue acquisitions, given your need to kind of batten down the hatches here.
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So, again, I'll refer you back to our guidance day. We were very clear about the RFPs that we intend to respond to, and I think that those are things that are really going to be 2017 events. As I mentioned in my remarks, we think that beyond the first quarter now, we're going to have a little time to digest and absorb all of this. We don't see a lot new coming on in 2016. In terms of acquisitions, again, the strategy hasn't changed. We're very disciplined about this. We're interested in acquisitions that are going to bring us into new states, and New York is a perfect example of that. That was a strategic acquisition. It gets us into the second largest Medicaid state in the country, and we've been trying to get into that state for many, many years. So, we're now all in five of the five largest Medicaid markets in the country. With regard to other acquisitions, I don't see anything that's going to come in, in 2016. But again, we've been pretty disciplined about our approach and we will continue to pursue the acquisitions as we outlined in February.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Inc.: Great. Just want to go back to the 2017 guidance and the confidence that you're going to get there. I mean, I'm still not 100% clear to me exactly what you mean by the investments in kind of the infrastructure, because I guess my initial thought would be you had that goal for 2017, you learned since then that there were investments that needed to be made with head count, with IT systems and that you're somehow still hitting that same margin target. It seems counterintuitive to me. So, how do you bridge that gap?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, this is Mario. I think that the way we bridge that gap is through some system changes that we have made. And we are in the process of updating, for example, a lot of our UM guidelines, which we think will lead to lower utilization. But some of this is just allowing those things to mature. As I mentioned, we've hired new nurses. Some of them are inexperienced, and some of them are not very facile with the computer systems. So as those things mature, I think that they'll become more effective and we can do a better job. Part of this is just tincture of time. We do see the profit margins rising in the backend of the year, and our projection is that that will continue into 2017.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Inc.: And so I guess, how much of your view about the margin mean reversion over the next couple years is predicated on getting above average rate increases over the next year working with the state departments (56:02) to do that versus having your medical management deliver cost savings?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, we have never counted on above average rate increases to drive our progress. We've always felt that if we can do a more effective job of managing the members, there is opportunity. And as I mentioned at the outset, we have plenty of revenue and plenty of membership. We are at the high end of our enrollment projections. So I think we're well-positioned.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Inc.: And, I guess, I also have a question about the growth dynamic. I mean, it sounds like you had a range of membership, you're at the high end of the range and that was enough to strain your systems. So I guess how do you think about your ability to grow? In 2016, it sounded like a little bit about rebase year, but you mentioned a lot of RFPs in 2017, thinking about doing deals again in 2017. I mean, is there growth target that you don't really want to get above as you think about that? Is there a right way to manage that number?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No, I don't think so. I mean, I think that part of our strategy is to continue to grow. It's really more a matter of timing. And we'll continue to grow in the future.
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Kevin, this is John. When we started this out, in I think it was 2012, with the idea that we were going to double the size of the company, we built our systems to double the size of the company and then a margin above that so that we wouldn't get caught too far ahead of ourselves. What we didn't realize is that we would then double the size of the company once again on top of that. So, I think that's where the constraint came in, in terms of some of the systems, which then flowed down into the people and processes. I think what we've done now is we have built a capacity that we need for the next several years, and we're confident that we're not going to have another strain like we just experienced in the first quarter of this year.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Inc.: All right, great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks for the question. There's a lot of things going on here, and sometimes when we see that, it ends up just being that the explanation for overall cost trend going higher. But yet you seem fairly confident that you can get resolved toward the end of this year or the back half of this year. So if we were to sort of classify some of these problems of the industry versus sort of management distraction issues versus cost trend not performing, how much of the different things do you think are those items like Puerto Rico seems fairly industry-wide, Ohio maybe the rate is industry but then there's a local management distraction issue. The TANF and ABD business not performing, it seems like it's a management distraction issue, so maybe those things are management. But how much of the rest of it is just overall cost trend being a little bit faster?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think is two things. I think, first, we did trip. There's no question that fair amount of this was our own fault. And that's what's led to some of the problem. I think the sort of pricing issue really revolves more around pharmacy than anything else. So, some of these utilization issues we talked about in the first quarter are really growing pains on our part. But I think the more systematic problem is the long-term pharmacy cost trend and we've been talking about that for a couple of years. Pharmacy cost are going up. Insulin, for example, a very common drug that lot of our patients use, has gone up quite a bit in price. We're seeing a lot of new specialty pharmacy drugs and this is not a problem just for us. I think this is industry-wide.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So you would classify sort of the industry stuff is being pharmacy issues, but the other stuff being sort of more within your control to fix going forward, is that a fair way to classify it?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then you threw out Zika there, but you really didn't sort of put the blame of any of the problems on Zika and it doesn't seem like a big deal yet. But is it driving more utilization in Puerto Rico? Are we seeing more doctor visits of pregnant moms or anything like that?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I think we are seeing people are scared and we're probably seeing people that have illnesses that are worried that they might have Zika. So it probably is driving a little bit of utilization. But I don't think we're having catastrophic costs related to Zika at this point.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Have you tried to quantify that yet? Is Puerto Rico could be a test market for what's going to happen in the rest of country as it moves up here?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think you're right about the fact that this could migrate to the Continental United States. But no, I don't think we have an answer on that one.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, good afternoon. Couple questions. One, obviously, you're anticipating better performance in the back half, have you seen any actual improvement or inflection in utilization in Texas or Ohio yet, or simply anticipating that you'll be able to affect that going forward?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, it's pretty early for us to comment on that, but I do think we are seeing improvement. But remember this is only the end of April so we haven't even completed the first month of the quarter.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Right. Secondly I just wanted to clarify I mean, you show us your premium costs and MLR performance by population and then you also show it by state, but we don't get it by population by state. So when we just look at Texas for example, TANF was not an issue for you broadly, ABD and Duals were, so in Texas we're using increased cost across all three of those populations?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think the increase are across a number populations. But you know in reference to your first comment, we cut this data a lot of ways, and we report quite a bit of information. I think we are very transparent. I don't think it's practical for us to produce more.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: No, that was intended to be a criticism. You definitely give more. I guess what I was trying to parse out was TANF, overall TANF costs broadly across your book looked inline and MLR was down and the issues that really seem to have growth, disproportionate growth in cost and MLRs were ABD and duals. So when we think about Texas and Ohio both, I just wonder if some of the cost issues were isolated in ABD and duals or if you'd say broadly in those states impacted TANF as well, that's what I was trying to get at.
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No. It's more an issue of ABD and TANF and it's more an issue around Ohio and Texas than the other states. I also think if you look at the numbers you'll also see that year-over-year, I think the medical costs are up, the MLRs are up in Illinois and Michigan. Both of those are areas where we have significant new populations because of the acquisitions. And then Ohio and Texas again, it was just general increases in utilization.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then finally, just kind of going back to the Zika topic, a little bit. I think we have a slide from I think your last Investor Day that showed 3% of your fee-for-service costs were in maternity and neonatal, which just I guess struck me as a pretty small number particularly for Medicaid population. So I didn't know if that was TANF only or if this was across your entire book but obviously would have some populations that wouldn't have higher relative maternity costs?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I'm not really sure what slide you're talking about. I don't have those in front of me. So I can't really address that.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. I'll follow up. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, guys. Good afternoon. So two questions and first on the marketplace business and you've chatted a lot about being confident in the numbers and visible cap that you're seeing things visibly going forward, I mean, that's clear and the goal that you're setting out for yourselves. What is the chance that more near term, that on the strong marketplace enrollment growth that you guys are getting adversely selected and that experience catches up with you and we feel more pain on the second quarter? If you could talk a bit to that. You mentioned have an almost real-time data, maybe alleviate some of our fears versus with respect to adverse selection in the marketplace.
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: It's Joe speaking, Tom. What you're suggesting is always possible of course. What we see though generally is a low utilizing a population. Now, the trade-off of that again is we tend to give money back in risk adjustments for that. I guess, all that we can say is in the course of the two and a quarter years we've been doing it, we haven't seen that development. Yes, it could happen in the future, but based on the demographics of our members and what we're seeing, it doesn't look like that's happening. Now remember – and we talked about this in the script, we're not expecting this business to produce 5% or 10% margins. We're expecting it to produce margins consistent with Medicaid which are obviously much lower. So, our expectations are lower going into it which might be why we're less disappointed. But again, we don't see anything so far that indicates we are getting sicker numbers.
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: And Tom, I'll also add that I think that our strategy has a lot to do with this. This is really an extension of our Medicaid product, using our Medicaid network. I think the patients that we're seeing are very similar to our Medicaid members generally, high degree of subsidy. And we never had a commercial product. So, there's no cannibalization of our commercial product into our exchange product. We really think that we're getting people who are low income and have either been on Medicaid in the past, or were uninsured in the past.
Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I guess what spooks me a little bit is just the growth that you saw this quarter, right, and Joe, I get that you've been there for a couple of years now. You haven't seen this experience so far. But a pretty sizable jump in the quarter. I guess that's what...
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You're right, Tom, and I would again get back to the network issues. I mean, this is our Medicaid network. And I think we're attracting patients that are similar to the demographics of our Medicaid patients.
Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay.
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We don't have any data.
Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Secondly, is the M&A you've done showing any kind of accretion at all given that most of these are in-market deals and plans that you bought? In the past, when we seen you do tuck-in deals like this, they tend to be accretive or they tend to work right from the start or at least pretty quickly. So, it sounds like the deals that have closed at least so far from when you started about a year ago, offered really no support against the challenges that you're highlighting, for example, like in Ohio and Texas. Is that there or are we off-base?
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes. So, Tom, there wasn't a lot of infrastructure buildout required in those states. But I think you can kind of break it into categories. So remember, that in Illinois and in Michigan, we are in new service areas. So, while the health plan staff for the most part are the same, we're dealing with new providers and we don't have a lot of claims experience in those areas. I mean clearly, you're right, we didn't get a big lift this quarter out of our acquisitions. That doesn't mean that we won't going forward. I think it's a little hard to sort out right now.
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Tom, this is John. You have remember, when we bring in new populations, we tend to set our claims reserves on an MCR method for the first few months in the first quarter, and then there is a provision for adverse deviation that we put on top of that. So that tends to the first quarter or two inflate the medical costs and then it comes down over time. So while you didn't see it happen in Q1, that's part of the improvement we'll see in the back half of the year.
Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So does your guidance – it sounds like your guidance include some amount of accretion from the M&A that you've done?
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Yes.
Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Is there any way to quantify that or give some of the magnitude or maybe I'll take it off-line.
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: That's probably best.
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: It's very difficult to do that under embark, (01:10:01) Tom, but we can talk.
Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question is a follow-up from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thanks for fitting me back in. It looks like the dollars spend on G&A came down $100 million from the February guidance and I know you guys had strong enrollment growth, so there's more members and you talked about investing in staff and systems, can you speak to what's the positive offset driving the lower G&A spend?
John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Just give us a second.
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Bear with me, Sarah. Sarah, I think to a degree there, we're victims of rounding, first of all, that's not $100 million. I'm sure that's probably closer to $50 million. It's just a matter of refining our estimates and looking at the degree to which we were are able to hire in the first quarter and fill positions and that kind of items.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got it. And as we think about the moving pieces into 2017, are you expecting any benefit from the new accounting guidance related to employee share-based payments can you speak to how much that would be once implemented?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: You put me on the spot there, Sarah. Honestly, I haven't researched that all lot. Our equity spend isn't particularly huge. We also lose the tax deductibility of that. I'll have to look into that and get back to you.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: But it sounds like that's not part of getting to the 1.5% to 2% maybe that would just be upside.
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: No. But I'll take a look at it.
Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So, Sarah, once again, we have saved the best for last. Thank you for your questions. So I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. That concludes our call and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

Mario Molina: Thank you, Juan José and thank you for that nice introduction. Hello everyone and thank you for joining our call this afternoon.  The fourth quarter of 2015 capped off a very strong year for Molina Healthcare. Net income more than doubled when compared to 2014, and we are making progress towards our goal of a 1.5% to 2% net income margin by the end of 2017. However, today I want to talk about our results within the framework of our mission and strategy.  Our mission is to provide quality healthcare to people receiving government assistance. One of our first objectives of our strategy over the past 35 years has been to grow and diversify our revenue. We have done just that in 2015. Revenue grew by 46% from $9.7 billion in 2014 to just over $14 billion in 2015. Revenue growth was driven by an increase in membership of about 35% from 2.6 million members in 2014 to slightly more than 3.5 million members by the end of 2015.  Our growth strategy can be divided into four components: growth and retention in our existing markets, expansion into new geographies, transitioning members and benefits from fee for service to managed care, and finally, developing and acquiring new products and capabilities.  During 2015 we successfully executed on all four of these components through our growth strategy. We retained and grew exisitng business with our re-procurement wins in Michigan and Washington. Our new contract in Michigan expanded our service area across all of the lower peninsula spanning an additional 18 counties. The Washington win along with our acquisition of Columbia United Providers strengthens our presence in the Southwest region. It also serves as a solid foundation to build on the state as the state continues to consolidate medical and behavioral health benefits under a single contract through additional regional procurements over the next few years. We also grew our marketplace enrollment from 15,000 members in 2014 to over 200,000 members in December 2015.  Finally, in-market or tuck-in acquisitions made a major contribution to our growth in existing markets in 2015. 2015 was the most active year in M&A in our company’s history. Of the nine acquisitions we announced in 2015, eight were in-market or tuck-in acquisitions in four of exisitng states. These acquisitions alone will add about $1.2 billion in premium revenue in 2016. Because these are asset purchases where we acquire the Medicaid contract from another health plan, these transactions have minimum retention [ph] risks and allow us to spread existing administrative overhead costs over a larger membership.  In keeping with the second component of our growth strategy, enter into new geographic markets, we launched our health plan in Puerto Rico in April of 2015. As I noted a minute ago, transitioning members and benefits from fee for service to managed care is the third component of our growth strategy. In 2015, we saw a strong growth in our Medicare Medicaid plan and aged, blind and disabled programs. While smaller in total numbers of members, these programs translate into strong revenue growth because these members come with much higher premiums when compared to the marketplace and Medicaid expansion programs or our tenant [ph] members.  The final component of our growth strategy is the development and acquisition of new products and capabilities. In addition to the in-market acquisitions that I have already discussed, we also acquired a behavioral health and mental health services provider, Providence Human Services in November. This transaction is now closed and has been rebranded under the name Pathways. Pathways brings in-house additional capabilities in behavioral health and some long term services and supports.  Altogether our growth strategy has allowed us to expand from less than 1 million members in 2005 to 3.9 million members today resulting in a compound annual growth rate of 16%. Our revenues on the other hand have grown 1.5 times faster than that of our membership during that same period. That is because we have a greater portion of our members with chronic health conditions that come with higher premiums, enabling us to achieve a compound annual growth of revenues of 24%.  In 2015 we saw net income more than doubled from $62 million in 2014 to $143 million in 2015. On a relative basis, our net income margin increased from 0.6% in 2014 to 1% in 2015, a jump of 67% and an important milestone on our path towards achieving our long term net income margin goal of 1.5% to 2%.  How do we improve our financial performance? Our medical care ratio declined from 89.5% of revenue in 2014 to 89% of revenue in 2015, while administrative costs rose only slightly pressured by costs associated with the marketplace. Nevertheless we have made solid progress on improving our margins. At the same time we have worked to keep our administrative costs low at around 8%, down from a high of 10% in 2013. This is significant when you consider that we continued to expand our business considerably over the past two years while growing into infrastructure we had invested in prior to commencing new contracts involving long term care services, and serving the chronic care conditions of dual eligible members.  We did all of these without losing our focus on quality. Five of our health plans improved their CMS quality ratings for Medicare to 3.5 stars and all of our eligible health plans maintained accreditation by the National Committee for Quality Assurance.  But that’s not all. We continue to invest in the company to better serve our members in the future. We installed electronic health records in all of our clinics earning meaningful use payments along the way. We also expanded the size of a number of our clinics and added behavioral health providers and social workers to help our members deal with mental health and social issues that were affecting and complicating their health care.  We built provider and member portals to allow physicians and members to interact with our health plans more easily. And we took steps to further bolster the privacy of protected health information. We implemented new Medicaid, Medicaid plan contracts in Michigan, South Carolina and Texas and brought up a new health plan in Puerto Rico. All of these things will drive shareholder value in the long term.  I am proud of the team that we have built and I am proud of what we’ve accomplished over the past 35 years. This past year was an inflection point in our efforts to improve our margins. That being said, the opportunity before us with managed long term care services for Medicaid patients and the opportunities for care coordination, our opportunity lies with these patients in the future. And our future is bright indeed.  And now I’d like to turn the call over to John who will review in detail the financial results for the quarter and the year ending December 2015.
John Molina: Thank you, Mario and hello everyone. As Mario said, the fourth quarter was a strong close to a strong year. Our financial performance in 2015 exceeded our expectations and bodes well for the future. In addition to our top line revenue and membership growth, we took substantial strides towards our margin targets for the end of 2017. We will be providing additional insight into what 2016 holds later this week during our investor day. But for now I want to focus on our performance throughout 2015.  Today we report full year earnings of $2.57, almost doubling the $1.29 we reported last year. Fourth quarter EPS of $0.51 and our full year earnings would have been $0.26 and $0.27 higher respectively but for the following items. First, we recorded a $15 million charge resulting from the early termination of a hospital management agreement. Let me be clear this expense has been included in our 2015 results and will not be a drag on earnings in 2016 [ph]. We [ph] incurred G&A expense relating to transaction costs during the quarter associated with our acquisitions. Finally, we also recognized $6 million in interest expense related to our recent senior note offerings that we issued in November, an expense that we will continue to recognize going forward.  Premium revenue was up almost 50% from 2014 and has more than doubled since 2013. That growth in itself is impressive but we should not forget the many paths we have traveled to get here. In two years we have established a start-up health plan in Puerto Rico, opened six Medicare Medicaid health plans, established a strong physician in the ACA marketplaces, won four key re-procurements, among our health plan and MMS states, closed on 10 acquisitions through January 2016, and provided over 0.5 million Medicaid expansion members the peace of mind that comes with access to affordable, quality healthcare. We did all of these while strengthening our capital position, improving profitability and staying true to our commitment to deliver quality healthcare to those most in need.  Words cannot express the pride that Mario, my sister Martha and I feel when we look at what Molina has accomplished. We offer our heartfelt thanks to each and every one of the 20,000 Molina team members who helped make this happen. We continue to transition from a company providing episodic medical care to also serving members with complex care needs that include healthcare and long term services and support.  During 2015 enrollment [technical difficulty] 3.5 million members, an increase of more than 900,000 members when compared to December of 2014. Membership growth remained strong across all lines of business as a result of continued organic Medicaid expansion growth, the launch of our Puerto Rico health plan, enrollment growth in our Medicare Medicaid plans in Texas and Michigan as they completed passive enrollment, strong marketplace enrollment, and the completion and closing of four in-market acquisitions during 2015.  Our marketplace business continues to perform well. Our fourth quarter marketplace medical care ratio was higher than we’ve seen earlier in the year. But this was the result of true-ups to our risk adjustment liability that relates to the entire year. Mario talked about the convergence of medical cost ratios between marketplace and the rest of our business last month in San Francisco. We will have more to say about this later in the week but for now it is enough to know that we are confident that marketplace enrollment will remain a valuable complement to our core business moving forward.  Medical margin improvement has largely driven our bottom line profitability improvement. In fact, all of our states saw improved medical margin compared to last year’s performance and our nearly $1.5 billion medical margin this year represents a 53% improvement to 2014 results. We believe that our lower medical care ratio in 2015 is the first indication of success for our efforts focused on care management and care coordination for our members with the most complex medical and social needs.  Our general and administrative ratio increased 8.2% in 2015 compared to 7.9% in 2014. If we remove the impact of marketplace broker commissions and exchange fees from the calculation, G&A ratio actually decreased from 7.8% in 2014 to 7.5% this year. Sequentially our G&A ratio in the fourth quarter of 2015 was higher than in the third quarter primarily because of higher costs incurred for the 2016 Medicare and marketplace open enrollments and various acquisition costs.  In general, we are very pleased with the year-over-year reduction in our consolidated medical care ratio. Improving administrative efficiency bolsters improving medical margins I spoke about a few minutes ago. As of December 31, 2015 the company had cash and investments of more than $4 billion, including in excess of $600 million at the parent company.  As our results include the reductions I first mentioned, I am pleased with our performance and our results for the year as we continue to grow while demonstrating progress towards our longer term goals. As a reminder, we will be hosting our investor day conference in New York city this Thursday, February 11 at 12:30 PM Eastern Time. At that presentation we will be discussing the company’s outlook and strategy for 2016. We look forward to seeing you there or encourage you to listen in via the webcast.  This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions but I will again remind everyone we will not be speaking to questions that address performance or expected performance for 2016. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.
Joshua Raskin : So first question, just on the hospital contract termination, I just wanted to better understand what exactly happened there. Was that some sort of contract dispute around rates, et cetera? And then were you in some sort of position where you owed the facility some sort of settlements, or how did that cost you guys money? 
John Molina: Josh, this is John. A little bit different kind of contract than we are used to. A couple of years ago, we actually went into a management of the acute care services of a hospital that we did not own but that a behavioral health company owned. Given their priorities and our priorities did not converge as we expected. We felt the best thing for us to do was to get out of that contract. In order to get out of that contract, we took a charge of $15 million. 
Joshua Raskin : So it was some sort of performance fee that you guys would have to -- it was just to break the contract, it sounds like. So it wasn't a medical expense or anything like that? 
John Molina: Correct. Josh, we did book it medical expense because it was part of our direct delivery network but not as an ongoing provider contract like we would have with an unaffiliated hospital.
Joshua Raskin : And so now you'll just replace it with some sort of fee-for-service payment to other providers in the market, whatever market that is? 
John Molina: That’s correct.
Joshua Raskin : And then just second, on the Texas performance fees, it looks like you didn't book -- I don't want to say you didn't book anything, but it didn't look like you booked the full amount for sure in the fourth quarter. Did you book anything? And then if not, are we now less confident or is this just again a timing issue, where you can't prove it, so you're not booking it? 
John Molina: I think it’s the latter, Josh. We didn’t book anything in the fourth quarter. It’s not that we are less confident, it’s just that we have really no additional news that would give us any more confidence at this point to book anything. It’s a very challenging environment to try in and keep the accounting in parallel with items that we can’t assess. 
Joshua Raskin : And then as I remember, John, you had given guidance early in the year, when you guys were providing initial guidance, that had included that, right? So I just want to make sure that's right. That's typically the practice, but if you anticipate getting some sort of performance fees, that will be included; and then we should think about your earnings coming in a little bit better relative -- despite the fact you didn't get any of the Texas performance fees. Is that fair? 
John Molina: That’s fair.
Joshua Raskin : And I assume you would just continue that practice. You'll assume you're going to be able to book performance fees as you've always been able to in your contracts? 
John Molina: We do assume that we will book a portion of it and on Thursday we can provide some additional insight into that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush. 
Sarah James : Thank you. You guys have had a number of contracts that renewed their rates. Since we last spoke there's, I think, Texas in September, and Michigan in October, and then a number in January. So if can you kind of walk us through what you're seeing so far with the rate update? 
John Molina: Sarah, this is John. I don’t have that numbers specifically for Texas and suffice it to say we are we’re going to be detailing that out on Thursday but it still remains very low single digits if anything at all. And I think a couple of states actually had some drop in the rates effective Jan 1. So the rate environment is not where we would like it to be and our improvement is not going to be driven primarily by increased rates. 
Sarah James : And was there anything out-of-period in the quarter in relation to the New Mexico true-up? I think in the past you guys had talked about the liability being in excess of third-quarter accruals there. So was there anything out-of-period recognized in New Mexico? 
Joseph White: Sarah, it’s Joe speaking. No, there wasn’t. If I can just tag on to what John said about rates, we’re not seeing anything different as he emphasized, now than we've been talking about for the last couple of years. Low single digits, at best. So I just wanted to make sure that that was familiar. But nothing picked up in New Mexico. 
Sarah James : And just to clarify, Joe, are liabilities still in excess of current accruals for New Mexico or are you guys kind of on par now? 
Joseph White: Going back to the third quarter disclosure, I wouldn’t say liabilities are in excess of accruals because the two equal each other. If you took the department’s most extreme position, I guess, that exceeds our liability but we do not believe that it’s going to play out the department’s most extreme position. So we think we are adequately reserved at December 31.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.
Steve Baxter : This is actually Steve Baxter on for Kevin. I wanted to come back to your comments on the exchange business. I guess can you quantify the impact, the dollar impact of the risk adjustment true-up in the quarter -- and I guess, what the entire net change to the Three Rs was? Just trying to get a sense for the run rate of the business headed into 2016. 
Joseph White: It’s Joe. I will take that question. Outside of risk adjustment the impact of the 3Rs is very minimal. Obviously the corridors I think everybody is familiar with. There's not a lot of protection from those. Reinsurance is pretty much easily measured. So then we are left with the risk adjustment and I think it’s fair to say that if you look at the year in total which we disclosed for marketplace [technical difficulty] the number for the full year. So I think broadly you can take the difference in MCR between the fourth quarter and the year to date and that would basically reflect the impact of risk adjustment for the quarter. 
Steve Baxter : And I guess nothing so significant that it kind of impacts how you feel like you are positioned for 2016? 
Mario Molina: Well, that’s a 2016 question. But I think John, he made it clear that we still feel reasonably confident about marketplace from our perspective. 
Steve Baxter : And then I guess on the recent acquisitions you guys have done, can you give us an update on the performance of Providence or I guess now, Pathways's performance, since you closed the deal, and performance of the tuck-in deals? I think you guys have said that those typically come on a little bit above total company margins. Is that kind of playing out with your expectations? 
John Molina: Providence is a little bit of a different animal than our normal managed-care tuck-ins. We see some of those come in with margins that start out a little bit lower and then they go higher. They start out a little bit lower because you’ve got some pent-up demand that occurs like usually in the first quarter after the acquisition, than of having higher margins overall because you don’t have to add as much in terms of an admin expense. Incremental admin for a tuck-in is less than the average. On Providence, that’s largely a fee for service business currently which Mario will discuss on Thursday how we want to use that in the future but we’ve only had it now for November and December. So it is moving along as we expected for the first two months. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.
Ana Gupte : So I wanted to just follow up on the 1.5% to 2% you've expressed confidence in the net income margin. How are the marketplaces performing? It looks like you went from about 55% to 70% in the third quarter, and now it's 73% or 74% on the MLR. As you are seeing the open enrollment membership coming in, ex-the Three Rs, and you've seen quite a bit of attrition, it looks like, how is this going to bode for next year? And do you expect margins to remain constant or expand? 
John Molina: So Ana, you said the magic words, the next year. We’ll talk about that on Thursday. 
Ana Gupte : But I guess from the experience in the fourth quarter, say, for going from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, you saw a little bit of deterioration. Are you seeing any issues with special enrollments? And when you look at the risk adjusters, are you thinking about a pooled risk adjuster across companies that are serving more than just the churn from the Medicaid population? And how have you booked it?
Joseph White: It’s Joe. I am not sure I understood the last question. But speaking in general, we feel that that for 2015 the full year financial performance we disclosed is indicative of where the margins ended up for this year. We don’t think fourth quarter reflects anything unique or any kind of inflection point. And as John and Mario said, we will talk about the rest on Thursday. 
Ana Gupte : And just following up on your tax rate, how should I think about this, when I'm modeling it? It surprised me a little bit because it was positive. 
Joseph White: The tax rate for the full year came in at – came in pretty close to what we thought it would come in when we guided back – revised guidance back in September. The rate came in around 56 – I want to say 56.2% -- which is 55.5% -- I think back in June, we guided to 56%. So it’s come in about what we expected it would come in at. Obviously it’s high for all the reasons we’ve talked about in the past, the non-deductibility of the health insurance provider fee in particular. 
Ana Gupte : But the fourth quarter came in lower than that, correct? Or am I reading that wrong? 
Joseph White: That’s correct. In the fourth quarter added very typical, we took in some discrete items that were favorable, various credits and stuff that are available, swapping [ph] credits, R&D credits, normal course type of stuff. The ETR has also helped out a little bit by the fact that our pre-tax income came in higher than we were anticipating back in June when we revised guidance. So that gives you a – that improvement in the pretax number gives you – also gives you some lift in lowering your effective tax rate. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna. 
Chris Rigg : Just one quick follow-up on the tax rate. If I normalize it for the health insurer fee, it looks like it came in in the upper-20% range in the quarter. Is that the right way to think about it? 
John Molina: I think at a very technical level, that might be the right way to think about it, Chris but again if you think about what happened in the fourth quarter, we had the benefit of the three items which are obviously not repeated in the other quarters. So that’s going to push down the rate. And again the fact that pretax income came in higher than we anticipated is also going to push down the ETR for the year and it’s all going to be magnified in the quarter. So like much of this year’s financial performance, I think the way to look at is to look at where we ended the full year on. And if you care to extrapolate, extrapolate from that, or wait until we talk about it on Thursday.
Chris Rigg : And then on the $15 million charge in the quarter, I know you guys don't update guidance very frequently, but was that $15 million assumed in the guidance that you had left out there? 
John Molina: No, it isn’t. 
Chris Rigg : And then the last question, which just may fall into the conversation later in the week, but you raised about $700 million a couple months ago. And it looks like a lot of that is still residual on the balance sheet. How should we think about the deployment of that money? 
John Molina: There really hasn’t been change in the strategy of how we want to deploy the money in terms of statutory capital as we enter new markets and acquisitions both of health plans and new capabilities. 
Chris Rigg : But is the money earmarked specifically for something at this point, or right now just in the kitty for future uses? – 
John Molina: Yes. 
Operator: Our next question comes from A.J. Rice from UBS.
A.J. Rice : Just a couple of quick things. On the duals, give us just your latest thoughts as you ended the year on that program. And I noticed specifically California, I guess, has announced they're going to delay their decision on whether to continue. Are you in discussions with them? What's happening just generally in the dual program, and particularly California? 
Mario Molina: This is Mario. Yes, the duals continue to march forward. We are happy with the contracts. The issue in California is around the managed care tax. I do think that’s going to get resolved. So we are not anticipating any changes in those programs right now. If there was one thing we would like to see the government do, it would be to allow us to market and enroll directly as we do for other Medicare beneficiaries. 
A.J. Rice : And I might just ask you quickly, for my follow-up, on the Puerto Rico. It looks like you had a very good medical care ratio in the quarter. Just wondering, it seems like that must be going well. Is there any update on Puerto Rico and how that's working? 
Mario Molina: There is not a lot to say about Puerto Rico at this point. We’ve had that contract for less than a year. I would say that it’s operating pretty much the way we anticipated. We had some initial startup problems that are typical for any kind of a new health plan but those have largely been ironed out and it seems to be doing well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse.
Scott Fidel : Thanks. Just had a question on Florida, it looked like the MLR was up quite a bit sequentially. Was that where you guys were booking the hospital management charge, or was there something else going on there? 
Joseph White: Hi, it’s Joe speaking. The main issue that you see pushing through the Florida MLR is just the adjustments that we talked about, the exchanges. Remember most of our exchange enrollment last year was in Florida. 
Scott Fidel : So that was mostly just the change in the risk adjuster accruals playing out in Florida? 
Joseph White: Exactly, exactly. So think of that as being spread over the entire year. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel.
Tom Carroll : Just one quick one on service revenue. It doubled sequentially; is that related to the Providence acquisition?
Joseph White: Tom, it’s Joe. That’s correct. We are recording a revenue associated with Pathways as service revenue and related expense as service expense, just to separate it from our health plan.
Tom Carroll : And then just a quick follow-up on the tax issues. The favorable items that were recorded in the fourth quarter -- were you mostly expecting those? Because we had modeled a much higher tax rate. 
John Molina: I don’t want to say our tax leadership may have forecasted it. I know that we typically do receive these kind of benefits, these kind of discrete benefits we generally record, that was in the fourth quarter. I don’t think there’s surprising in their size, I think what you might not have modeled, I don’t know what Tom, what you modeled for pretax income number. But again if you modeled a pretax income number much as we expected in our guidance, when that number turned out higher, it’s going to push down the effective tax rate. So that might be your issue there. 
Tom Carroll : So maybe these things just come in when they come in, and for the full year you were pretty much right on where you expected, that's probably how I should think about it? 
John Molina: Again with the exception that pre-tax income came in higher than we expected, so that was a little bit of a – depressing all the tax rate. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.
Gary Taylor : I was just slightly tuned out two questions ago. So I hope I'm not asking the same question, but if I am, just tell me to move on. But, Joe, you've done a good job all year describing to us that some of these very low MLRs in the marketplace business aren't completely obviously accruing to earnings because the minimum medical loss ratios. Given that you've got these additional risk adjustment accruals in the fourth quarter, were you able to reverse any of the rebate accruals for the year to date? 
Joseph White: Yes, they are small right now. The rebate accruals are within – well under $10 million. I don’t have that handy but they’ve pretty much dropped to nothing.
Gary Taylor : And also I just wanted [technical difficulty] the loss ratio includes that $15 million. So really that's, maybe, recurring numbers, about 40 basis points lower -- $88.7 million maybe? Is that right? 
Joseph White: I haven’t done the math on that but you are correct. It is in medical costs, so to get an MLR you’d have to back that out.
Gary Taylor : And then last question, I guess I have lost track of MyCare Chicago? Did that transaction close yet? We were looking for maybe $60,000 in Illinois enrollment, which obviously wasn't in the year-end number sequentially. 
John Molina: This is John. We are still waiting on one of the Chicago acquisitions to close in March, the rest closed in January. 
Joseph White: It’s Joe again. So when they’re closed in January obviously you don’t see them on these numbers. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with Raymond James.
Michael Baker : Just a follow-up on the earlier question in terms of Pathways, Providence. Sounds like that's running through service revenue. When you have a situation in which a state includes behavioral going forward, at some point are we going to see some of that revenue get allocated to that state as you do services internally or how should we think about that? 
Joseph White: Mike, it’s Joe speaking. I think what you will see going forward is that the health plan will pick up a portion of that service expense – the bottom line impact should be improved, slightly improved margins. 
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies.
Dave Windley : Part of my Florida question was asked a couple of minutes ago, but I did want to clarify, we were also expecting a rate update to impact your revenue and MLR in the fourth quarter, and I think recognizing maybe five or even six months' worth of rate updates in the fourth quarter. Did that happen and what impact on the MLR did that have, if you can tell me? 
John Molina: Dave, are you talking specifically about Florida?
Dave Windley : Yes.
John Molina: The Florida rate increase was –
Joseph White: I think the Florida rate increase, we start about 5%, we started picking that up September – 
John Molina: So we talked about in the last call.
Joseph White: So that’s been there from September [ph]. 
Dave Windley : So you did accrue that in the last quarter pro rata? It wasn't a cash back in the fourth quarter? 
Joseph White: Correct, for two months.  End of Q&A
Operator: And we have no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back to you.
Mario Molina: Well, thanks for joining us everyone. We look forward to seeing you on Thursday in New York for investor day. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you once again for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, Thursday, October 29, 2015. I would now turn the conference call over to Juan José Orellana, Senior Vice-President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan José Orellana - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations & Marketing: Thank you, Jorge . Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare's financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015.

This call is being recorded and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available at our company's website, molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina.
J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Juan José and thanks everyone for joining us on the call today as we review our financial results and key accomplishments for the quarter. As outlined in today's earnings release, we continued to grow enrollment and revenue when compared to last year and last quarter. We're making progress on our long-term margin improvement efforts. In addition, we remain watchful of new business opportunities. For example, over the last three quarters we've announced six transactions. These acquisitions have afforded us new avenues to expand our current health plan business and add capabilities to our service offering. Since we covered a considerable amount of information at our last Investor Day in New York just last month today, I will primarily highlight a few recent developments and discuss some of the things that have changed since our presentation in September. John will address our quarterly financials in greater detail during his remarks. For now, all I have to say is that those results are very good indeed. As of this September nearly 18 million people have gained health insurance by signing up for Medicaid or the marketplace as a result of the Affordable Care Act. The uninsured rate has fallen from a high of 18% to nearly 11%, the lowest uninsured rate in 50 years. And we at Molina Healthcare are doing our part to ensure that everyone has access to care. Our enrollment has grown by approximately 1.5 million members to 3.5 million since January of 2014. Today, we serve more than 0.5 million Medicaid expansion members and over 200,000 low-income marketplace members. But our contribution to healthcare goes beyond the numbers of members we serve. Our most important contribution lies in our commitment to providing access to quality healthcare for our members. To that end, we have set about expanding and deepening the care capabilities that we bring to our members. We are focusing on quality outcomes, care integration, and measurable results. During our Investor Day, we talked at great length about our acquisition of Providence Human Services. You will recall that Providence is one of the nation's largest providers of behavioral and mental health services with 6,800 employees, more than 80% of which are client facing, and operations in 23 states and the District of Columbia. The company's broad national footprint is deployed by a local level enabling it to effectively target specific needs in diverse geographies. As states continue to look for cost effective strategies to manage the care of individuals with more complex healthcare and behavioral needs, we will continue to see more states move towards the integration of behavioral health and medical services. We're excited about the opportunity to pursue these initiatives with our new capability. And we look forward to bringing the skills, enthusiasm, commitment, and expertise of the Providence team to our members. In the meantime, we remain focused on closing this transaction in the near future. Given our recent acquisition activity, I wanted to remind everyone of our approach to M&A. In general, our acquisition strategy falls into three categories. New markets, existing markets, and new capabilities. When we target a new market, our goal is to continue to diversify our geographic footprint by increasing the number of state contracts that we hold. Over the long-term, this allows us to leverage our administrative infrastructure across a broader revenue base and drive down cost. In an existing market, our goal is to strengthen our competitive position and market share by pursuing bolt on acquisitions. These types of transitions typically see higher accretion levels and given our established infrastructure in these markets, enable us to drive short-term administrative leverage and create long-term value. When evaluating a new capability or the enhancement of an existing capability or provider arrangement, our strategy is to strengthen provider alignment to ensure our goals align with our providers goals, improving medical costs over time. Our pipeline remains robust and we have continued to execute on our acquisition strategy. Integral Health Plan in Florida is a 90,000 member Medicaid plan operating in the Pensacola, Tampa, Sarasota and Fort Myers regions. This acquisition further expands our Medicaid footprint to seven of the 11 Medicaid regions across the state. We expect the Integral acquisition to generate approximately $250 million in annualized revenue and that the transaction will close later this year. In Illinois, Loyola Physician Partners serves as a medical home for approximately 20,000 members in Cook County. This acquisition further expands our Chicago area footprint, complementing our recently announced acquisition of MyCare in July. Loyola is expected to generate approximately $50 million in revenue on an annualized basis and we anticipate that this transaction will close in the first quarter of 2016. As I mentioned before, the integration process for in market acquisitions benefits from our existing infrastructure and local presence. Because of this, the process requires minimal resources at the corporate level and allows for a significant portion to be completed locally. Our record number of acquisitions this year, while significant, has not diminished our focus on retaining existing business. In Michigan, for example, we currently provide services in 50 counties where approximately 1.3 million individuals eligible for Medicaid receive care. Our current enrollment, which includes members from the HealthPlus acquisition, is about 340,000 members across multiple lines of business. Earlier this month, the State of Michigan announced its health plan recommendations for their Medicaid program to begin January 2016. And we are pleased to announced that Molina Healthcare of Michigan was recommended for eight regions covering 65 counties. Our dual eligible programs continue to drive up membership and premium revenue quarter-over-quarter, with the majority of our states completing the passive enrollment process. Texas will complete passive enrollment this month, while South Carolina is still purely voluntary, with a passive enrollment date now set for April 1. As we near the end of the passive enrollment phase in these programs, it is important to understand that our focus shifts from enrolling new members to member retention. Last, I want to congratulate our New Mexico Plan President, Patty Kehoe, and the staff of our New Mexico Health Plan for being recognized at the Pinion Level by Quality New Mexico as part of its New Mexico Performance Excellence Awards. The award recognizes organizations that show evidence of using systemic processes as a foundation to attain improved overall outcomes. That concludes my commentary about the quarter. We continue to experience an exciting and extended period of growth. We continue to be well-positioned for the future and I look forward to what that will bring. With that, I will now turn the call over to John for a look at our financial performance in the quarter.
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: As Mario noted, from a financial perspective this was an excellent quarter for Molina Healthcare. Net income per diluted share more than doubled to $0.77 this quarter compared to $0.33 in the third quarter of 2014. For the year to date, net income per diluted share is $2.07 compared to approximately $0.60 for the same period last year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter increased to $0.89 per diluted share compared to just $0.48 during the same quarter a year ago. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I want to point out a couple of the most important takeaways from our progress for the first three quarters of 2015. First, top line revenue remains strong. Total revenue reached $10.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This is the second year in a row in which we have recorded more revenue year-to-date through September than during the entire previous year. Second, we continue to expand our margins. Our net profit margin for the last six months was 1.1%, a 70 basis point improvement over the last year. Our margin improvement over last year has been driven by three key factors, higher revenue, improved medical cost efficiencies and full reimbursement of the Affordable Care Act Health Insurance Fee. As is usually the case, there are some moving parts in the numbers when looked at on a quarterly basis, so let me tell you how those parts fit together. First, we have now recognized all revenue related to Medicaid Health Insurance Fee Reimbursement from January 2014 through September 2015. Our final HIF catch up this quarter added approximately $25 million to pre-tax income for the quarters, $8 million of which related to 2014. This amount was offset by $25 million in reduced revenue related to 2014 for medical cost corridors and profit limitations. The reduction in revenue related to 2014 is the result of the challenges posed by cost floors and profit limitations that are built around vague, ambiguous and poorly defined contract terms. We have several other costs floors and profit limitations to settle so I don't want to imply that this issue is behind us. But we have started the process, and with time will come more clarity. The important point to note is that these two items offset each other. Next, our medical care ratio continues to improve year-over-year, as we reported an 88.9% medical care ratio for the last nine months, compared to 89.6% in the same period last year. Absent the $25 million reduction related to the 2014 cost floor true-ups, which I just mentioned, our third quarter medical care ratio would have been consistent with the first two quarters of this year. Our MMP plans or Medicare Medicaid Plan, in particular on a quarter-over-quarter basis saw significant improvement. We continued to benefit from administrative cost leverage but you need to look a little bit deeper into the numbers to see it. If we ignore significant marketplace, broker and exchange fees, which weren't present last year our G&A ratio was 7.4% for the third quarter of 2015. It is 7.5% year-to-date. As a reminder, we do not provide quarterly guidance, and do not change guidance unless there is a material change in our business. Therefore, we're not going to adjust the year-to-date guidance that we've previously given and you should take nothing regarding our operations from that. Our results demonstrate that we continue to make progress towards achieving our 2017 margin goals that we have set for ourselves. I want to mention that while we're not providing specific guidance for 2016 on this call, I want to make a few general comments regarding the marketplace. First, open enrollment period for 2016 is slated to start this upcoming Sunday, November 1. Our premium levels are competitive headed into the enrollment window and we believe the marketplace will continue to be profitable in 2016. Second, I want to point out that the drop in marketplace enrollment that we saw between the second quarters and third quarters of this year is due to general attrition. Unlike enrollment in Medicaid, marketplace membership does not grow or replenish throughout the year. Mario touched on our acquisitions earlier, so let me just add that three health plan acquisitions remain open and are anticipated to close in the fourth quarter of 2015 or in early 2016. Combined, these account for roughly 180,000 new members or $300 million in new top-line revenue from health plan operations on an annual basis. Days in claims payable was flat sequentially and the company had cash and investments in excess of $3.7 billion, including approximately $470 million at the parent. As we discussed during Investor Day, we anticipate cash outflows will accelerate in the fourth quarter, as we begin to pay for acquisitions that have closed and disperse accrued dollars related to Medicaid expansion corridors. Finally, at our Investor Day in February 2013, we set our goal to double the size of the company from $6 billion in revenue to a run rate of $12 billion in revenue by the end of 2015. I'm pleased to report that as of the end of the third quarter, we remain forced to exceed that goal. We have achieved this by continuing to emphasize providing access to high-quality care, by operating in the right states, pursuing the right programs, building the right provider networks and hiring the best employees. This past year, we began shifting our focus towards expanding our margins. And as you can see from our results, we're getting some traction on that front for which we are pleased. This concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please to ahead.
Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. Thank you. My first question is on the rate outlook, as you head into next year and I'm asking partly in the context of another large competitor or company in the industry that talked to seeing or potentially seeing some adverse impact going into next year. Can you just talk about where you stand relative to rate resets?
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: Sure, Matt. We did get a rate adjustment in Florida, that's effective September 1, that I believe is about a gross 7% increase, but there are some provider passes et cetera. So it'll end up being somewhere in the neighborhood of 5%, 5.5%. I believe that's the only one that we have now that's sort of lock downed.
Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And what are you anticipating for some of your other geographies. I mean, I guess the question I'm asking is, is this an environment where Medicaid plans have generally been doing well and you find some of your states are in a mode where they're contemplating rate increases that might be tougher?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Matt, if you look back over the last several years, the success of plans like Molina increasing our profitability, is due more to our own operations, than has been to increases in rates. We've been experiencing flat to low single-digit rates for the past several years. So, I don't know that we're going to be expecting decreases or anything of that nature. We will see some or likely to see some, with respect to the Medicaid expansion rates because we are accruing money to give back under those programs.
Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay.
J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Matt, this is Mario. If you go back to our Investor Day, I think there was a nice table where we went through our expectations around rate increases. And there's really not been much changed since that Investor Day presentation.
Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Good fair enough. If I could just on the -- on the cost and rebate floors that you referred to, is the -- the $25 million there that was offset by recruitment of the Health Insurer Fee. Is that, that was something that you were not in a position to recognize last year because you just couldn't know or didn't have a good basis for knowing how it was going to come out?
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: That's correct.
Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Got it.
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: We had money accrued but this was above and beyond that.
Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And do you feel that you are closer to understanding what the methodology is at least that you'd be in a better position to predict it going forward?
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: As long as they don't change the methodology, I think we're in good shape.
Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Fair enough. All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe just following up, make sure I understand the $25 million adjustment. Is -- when you guys laid out your guidance for this year, should we think that that was in there or it was just such an unknown that you did not have that in your guidance?
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: Now, A.J., a big portion of that came from New Mexico and Washington. Washington was a change in the risk adjustment methodology. So we had no visibility to it when we put in our guidance numbers. And in New Mexico it related to the retroactive adjustments that they made with respect to a certain population that came in, I guess retroactively.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And is it, I know you said you think you're getting your arms around all the 2014 exposure. Are there open ended issues with respect to what's happening in 2015 that might be like this either for the fourth quarter or next year?
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: There are potentially because some of the methodologies are not articulated very clearly in the state contract. So, there is some interpretation of medical costs and such. We believe that in the discussions we have with the states that are impacted, there was a good dialogue with the state regulators and we would hope that there wouldn't be much impact either way.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And just, I know you don't update full year outlook unless there is a material change, but I guess the $25 million, which wasn't contemplated, would seem to me to be meaningful. You're not updating guidance in any way for that. So, does that imply that the rest of the business is effectively – you're raising your outlook for the rest of the business to offset that, is that the way we should – because I think you did say you always had contemplated collecting the Health Insurance Fee, albeit, you didn't know what quarter it was going to come in.
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: Again, I hate to isolate one factor and say that is the only thing that's material. We have a number of acquisitions that are coming in in the fourth quarter that we didn't contemplate at the beginning of the year, that certainly will have an impact on earnings. And to try and pinpoint just for the sake of a single quarter doesn't make a lot of sense. I would say that from a revenue and profit margin perspective, we are at a place that is a little bit further than what we thought, but it doesn't make sense since what we're really driving to is a sustainable profit margin in 2017, to really monkey around with the numbers for one quarter.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And maybe just one last data point question there. I guess you picked up 65,000 in Medicaid expansion lives during the quarter. I guess it's – it seems to be late in the year to be seeing more Medicaid expansion unless you're in – there's somehow a new market or is this acquisitions that are doing that? How did you end up picking up 65,000 new Medicaid expansion lives?
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: It is for the most part the acquisitions.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. I hate to harp on this $25 million issue, but just want to make sure I understand. Obviously, they've changed the methodology with which they're looking back at 2014. Is that now contemplated in your thoughts for 2015 as well? Or have you sort of recalibrated based on what the states are telling you in terms of floor definitions, et cetera?
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: We think, Josh, that we've got it pretty well ironed out now.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. But did you have – I guess my question is, did you have any catch-up accruals in the third quarter to account for the fact that if they applied the same methodology, for argument's sake, that maybe you'd owe more money back to the states as well?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Josh, it's Joe speaking. Very insignificant, because if you think of it, the bulk of this activity happened in 2014. So, there were some adjustments, but they were relatively insignificant relating to 2015, a few million dollars.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. But you know what I mean, Joe, where I say, if they are assuming, whatever they are defining these costs to be or the premium calculation, I would assume if you guys were owing money – if you guys owed money last year, maybe you'd owe it again this year. But it doesn't sound like you've made any extra accruals for this year, this all relates to the prior year?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: No, Josh, to be clear, we true up all accruals through the report date based on our knowledge as of that date. So we have adjusted those numbers. It's just that the impact on 2015 wasn't particularly severe. So, for example, if you think of New Mexico, most of the retroactivity happened in 2014.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So that was a specific cohort. I got you. Got you. Okay. And then just on Puerto Rico, the MLR moved down from, say, 95%, I assume that was just sort of a target accrual number, to just below 90%. I guess I am curious how operations are going there and are you guys now accruing based on claims or just better estimates in terms of your targets? I'm just curious why the MLR came down there.
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Josh, it's Joe speaking. We are moving towards reliance on claims, but oftentimes in the initial months of a startup, we generally tend to run higher MCRs, so what you're seeing now is we're moving closer to what we expect that to run.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So, a 90%-ish number is what you would expect in the future or you think it comes down from there?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: I wouldn't think it would drop much more below 90%.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got you. So, clearly no claims trends or anything that are unusual or out of the ordinary that you didn't expect?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: That's correct. So far it appears to be what we expected it to be. If you look back to, Mario mentioned our guidance presentation at the beginning of the year, we thought it would come in around 91%. So, it's pretty much coming in where we thought it would.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Okay.
Unknown Speaker: Anything else, Josh?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks for the question. Question sort of relates to the guidance and then sort of known items in the fourth quarter, I like to break it down by business instead of by state. If you look at your original guidance for the year on a GAAP basis it was $2.35. After nine months you're at $2.07, so that leaves sort of $0.28 for the fourth quarter. And I want to be clear that you're not actually reiterating the $2.35, you're just not updating that. So it's not necessarily $0.28 that you're telling us to get to for the fourth quarter. And then the remainder of the question is, are there known items to you now going into the fourth quarter that are going to go up either in the Medicaid expansion business, and you've been running at a very low MLR there. You said you've been accruing for the various updates, but is there something that's going to make that go up, that loss ratio go up in the fourth quarter? The same question regarding the medical – the marketplace business, where you're at sort of 70% loss ratio. Do you expect that to go higher in the fourth quarter? And then third, your acquisitions. Overall, do you expect them to be accretive or dilutive going into the fourth quarter?
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: So, Pete, that's a lot of great questions there, so let me see if I can parse it out. I'm going to start with the three business lines questions first and then get to guidance. With respect to the Medicaid expansion, you have to remember that the GAAP definition for Medical Care Ratio is different than what the states are using and the states frankly are using different requirements, or different components depending on the state. But we don't expect other than normal seasonality that that should increase materially. With the marketplace, I would say the same thing. We did see some deterioration in the enrollment. It may be that folks didn't pay their premium and some were dropped off and it's most likely that the folks who didn't pay their premiums were not using – utilizing a lot of services anyway. So, there may be a bit of a mix shift there. But again, I don't think it's going to mean anything material. The third question was acquisitions. We did close a couple of acquisitions in this quarter, the HealthPlus acquisition and the Integral acquisition. Pardon me, and the smaller one in Florida, Integral will close in the fourth quarter, Preferred was closed in the current quarter. We do tend to see pent-up demand early on with these types of acquisitions. I think we've talked about that ad nauseum before, so that you may see something. But then we'll also get some possibly towards of the end of the fourth quarter, some of the normalization from the acquisitions that closed in the third quarter. So again, I don't know that that's going to be a significant impact. With respect to guidance, I think the way you characterize it is correct. We're not updating guidance, on the other hand, we're not confirming that low number. It is -- the number is going to be what it is after we have the medical costs and the admin costs running through there. You will see an increase in the admin costs related to what we're doing in terms of the marketplace in Medicare enrollment. You may see a little bit higher medical cost because it is the fourth quarter, but nothing that I would is say is extraordinary.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you. That was helpful.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Stephen Baxter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hello, this is Steve Baxter filling in for Kevin. Sorry to come back to the $25 million again, does that all relate to the TANF businesses in Washington and New Mexico or is there any of that spread out in ABD?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: It's Joe speaking. It's about $20 million or so related mainly to TANF in New Mexico and the rest to expansion in Washington.
Stephen Baxter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, thanks. So I guess if I am looking at the sequential TANF, CHIP MLR it was up about 300 basis points in rough math, I guess we'd probably explain about half of that. I guess is there anything else you want to highlight there in terms of kind of pressure you saw in the quarter or is that just reading too much into it?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: I think we'd say that's reading too much into it, it's a single quarter. I wouldn't – I wouldn't read beyond John's remarks about rates at the beginning of the call.
Stephen Baxter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then, I guess the sequential movement in the marketplace MLR. I think it was in the mid-50s in the second quarter, now moving into the mid-70s. Is that the progression that you would expect? I guess, it's hard for us to totally understand how that business is running, I think you guys are the only ones who disclose it, is that correct?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Yeah, we don't have enough history with this large of a population to draw any conclusions definitively at this time.
Stephen Baxter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you.
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: I think, with that said we can say that year-to-date number, it's pretty solid.
Stephen Baxter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you.
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: Focus on the year-to-date not the quarter.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Cornelia Miller - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. This is Cornelia in for Andy. So some of your large cap peers have discussed competitive pricing on the exchanges and some potential for enrollment declines next year. Do you think you can grow your presence meaningfully on the exchanges and do you have any expectations to pick-up lives from some of the co-ops closing?
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: This is John. I don't know if we have too many of the co-ops closing in the states that we are doing the marketplace. We priced our products at a point we thought they would be competitive and yet remain profitable, and I would also want to make sure that people understand it's not just the premium, it's also things like co-pays, deductibles, et cetera that really roll into what a competitive financial package is. But we think, we're well positioned for the marketplace going into next year.
Cornelia Miller - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, just in Florida, it looks like your MLR increased almost 600 basis points quarter-to-quarter. Is it possible to breakout what that was driven by (33:45) long-term care versus the exchanges or should we be thinking about the majority of that was the increase from the 55% to 73% in the exchange MLR?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Yeah. It's Joe speaking, you have it at the end, it's a trend in marketplace.
Cornelia Miller - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Yeah. Thanks. Good evening. First question is about the RFPs. You obviously won in Michigan, Georgia and Iowa were not successful. So as you look at the wins and the criteria are there any learnings from what might have made things different? And what the criteria that are being used right by largely just incumbents versus new entrants?
J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, this is Mario. I think, the clearly incumbents in a state like Georgia have an advantage. You're operating there, you've got your networks in place, you're well known both to the state and to the providers. So that clearly played into it. I don't want to comment on Iowa. We are happy with the results in Michigan. I wouldn't read a whole lot into it, they were three RFPs in three different states with a lot of different criteria. So it's hard to draw conclusions across them
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: And as you bought the behavioral piece in Providence and other capabilities you're building it seems to be the services. And you look at the upcoming pipeline of RFPs, can you comment on what those might look like, and I believe Virginia comes out maybe in the next year and Pennsylvania is out there, Nebraska and so on.
J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, we didn't do the acquisition because of the RFPs. We did it because we believe there is an overall trend in the Medicaid program to integrate and coordinate behavioral health with the medical benefits, and that's a long-term trend. At the same time, in many states where we're being asked to manage those benefits we felt that it was prudent for us to have a stronger presence in the behavioral health area, and also to have providers that we can draw on. So Providence is largely a provider organization, providing care to Medicaid beneficiaries. It matches very well with our business and our strategy.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay. Got it. Thanks. One more if I may on the G&A. Where do you think this will settle out here? You have some pressure here, with some drivers for that. What is just the target right now on the normalized G&A and then on the loss ratio as well with the 89.3%. So is it still at the 2% net margin that we should be kind of thinking about and what the timing of that margin might be? Can you give us some color?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Ana, we haven't changed our thinking in terms of where we want to be in 2017.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay. Great. And then one final one, if I might. On exchanges you say you're positioned well, obviously we're hearing a lot of angst from others. You had 200,000 (37:03) losses this quarter but it's sort of 200,000 plus. Any thoughts on what you might expect to see in the open enrollment season that is starting a couple of days from now?
J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, this is Mario, we have not provided any guidance on what we think our 2016 marketplace is going to look like. It's really hard to tell. We have put together what we think are competitive rates. We remain in operations in all the states where we had operations last year. We have slightly expanded our footprint by adding a few new counties. But remember too that the primary goal of our entering into the marketplace was to provide continuity of care for people that had been on Medicaid and may be no longer qualified and had become uninsured as a result. And that continues to be the strategy. If you look at our marketplace enrollment, it is largely people below 250% of poverty.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Yeah. That makes a ton of sense. Yeah, thanks, Mario. I appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Wright with Sterne Agee CRT. Please go ahead.
Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT: Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions. Is there a way or do you have any guess or sense as to kind of what the buckets of attrition for the public marketplace is between tax documentation, immigration documentation and failure to pay premiums? And just kind of any insights into deadlines that may have occurred in the third quarter specifically for any of those issues?
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: Brian, this is John. You're working way too hard, if you start this by saying good morning. We don't have the granular detail in terms of why people rolled off the marketplace during the third quarter.
Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT: Okay. And then...
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: It'd just be speculation on our part.
Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT: Yeah. Do you have anything procedurally as far as any insights into some of the procedural documentation kind of deadlines for any of those issues or...
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: I don't believe that they give us reasons why people drop off, whether it's, whatever you had cited to.
J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We're – Brian, this is Mario, the answer is no.
Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT: Okay, then no worries. And then one that I know you can help me out with. Texas kind of picked up a bit sequentially, was there – on the MLR side. Was there anything kind of one time-ish or anything that you could point us to to what may be driving some of that?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Go ahead Joe.
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: It's the launch of the MMP in Texas, Brian, that's picking up speed.
Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT: Okay.
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: So, we'll run higher (40:00) MCR in the initial stages.
Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT: So, that's just an initial – based on guests, but not based on claims?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Correct.
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: Correct.
Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT: Great. Okay, thank you.
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.
Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hey, guys. Not to beat this horse to death but on the $25 million, can you give us just a sense of sort of the gestation of how that occurred? I mean, is this something that just sort of came up during the quarter or has this been – particularly I think, you said New Mexico it's about $20 million. Sort of how long has this been ongoing and when you kind of came to a resolution on it?
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: I'll take the first part of that. If you flip back through our 10-Qs, particularly in the Washington situation, we've been talking about this for a number of quarters. The issue related to Washington is essentially our rates are tied to premium adjustment across – risk adjustment across the entire population and we don't have visibility into that. We've been talking about that for a long time in the 10-Qs and we just got clarity on it just this quarter. You can also go back to our Investor Day back in September where we talked a fair amount about this. But suffice to say, these are – until these amounts are at least settled for the first year, it's very uncertain as to the actual mechanics of the calculation and the definitions involved.
Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. And then just on the guidance, again I appreciate your comments. But is there any – you kind of gave some of the puts and takes for the fourth quarter, but is there anything large either on the plus side or the negative side that we should be thinking about or is it just sort of normal business trends with some impacts from maybe some of the recent acquisitions?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: I would say that, Chris.
Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. The first one on the Providence acquisition, you talked at the Investor Day about spending I think in the order of $160 million on behavioral-related care. How quickly in the overlap, perhaps how quickly can you begin to leverage Providence services into your health plan footprint?
J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: This is Mario. It's hard to say at this point because we haven't closed the acquisition, the first thing we've got to do is close and then we can get in there and begin talking to them about how we can make better use of their services, but that is our goal. I just can't give you any idea on the timing.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: And did I understand correctly that it would also be maybe the second step in the goal would be to expand the Providence footprint into additional Molina states?
J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Certainly.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Then on I guess Texas Quality where – sorry, if this question has been asked. Do you have any better visibility on the – what has been opaque calculation on that?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Dave, I think, Juan José wins $25 because he bet at some point, someone would ask that even if we were silent. No, we've got no update.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And in Michigan with re-procurement there and the -- I think eight regions that you were awarded, is it your expectation that membership would be about stable or do you think you can pick up some incremental numbers based on your going forward footprint?
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: Usually, we would only expect to pick up membership if one or more plans in a region were dropped. I think in a couple of regions and we may have one plan that was dropped and so that membership would be distributed. But for the most part, we think it will largely be stable.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And the HealthPlus acquisition, is the only kind of cross benefit there, just leverage as an SG&A presence in the state. Is that what I remembered from the Investor Day conversation?
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: That's a big portion of it, yes.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Okay. All right. Thank you.
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: Great.
Operator: Our final question is a follow up question from Brian Wright with Sterne Agee CRT. Please go ahead.
Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT: I missed a bit of the answer on that last one, I apologize. Is there any set timeframe on getting greater clarity on the definitions in Texas?
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: Well we thought we would have it by the end of the third quarter, Brian we're hoping that we'll have it by the end of the year. I recall the last time we got it it was about 15 months before we got clarity. So, if they give it to us by the end of the year, it will be a step in the right direction.
Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT: Right. So, there is a chance but we're not holding our breath.
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: I'm not.
Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.
J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: All right. Well, thank you everyone. We appreciate you joining in the call. It was a good quarter and we look forward to talking to you at the next earnings release.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Molina Healthcare Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, July 30, 2015. I would now like to turn the conference over to Juan José Orellana, SVP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.
Juan José Orellana: Thank you, Thaddeus. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare’s financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015. The company’s earnings release reporting its results was issued today after the market close, and is now posted for viewing on our company website.

This call is being recorded and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available at our company’s website, molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina.
Dr. Mario Molina: Thank you, Juan José. Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us today as we report our second quarter results for 2015. I am pleased to report that during the second quarter, we maintained momentum in our business and continue to deliver great financial results. We are growing, we are diversifying and we are driving strong operating results. Striking a balance between growth and profitability is an imperative for us. As a result, we were very pleased to deliver both revenue and enrollment growth that was nearly 50% greater than what we reported during the second quarter of 2015. After the first two quarters of the year, our net profit margin now stands at 1% and we saw a net profit expansion of 80 basis points sequentially. My father used to say shoemaker mind I last, and we have done so. While speculation and mega deals among the commercial players have been grabbing all the headlines, we have remained focused on growing our core business and we have been involved in several key acquisitions of our own. The transactions that we have announced demonstrate our continued focus on government programs and our ability to use our expertise in providing access to healthcare to those who needed most and who are least able to afford it. We remain focused on our mission to serve low income individuals that require government assistance. Let me provide you with some greater details on each of these transactions. Our transaction with Preferred Medical Plan in Florida will add about 25,000 Medicaid members to our Florida health plan, doubling our Medicaid enrollment in the Miami-Dade market. Many of our existing providers are also contracted this preferred medical plan. Therefore this acquisition will deepen our relationships with providers. We anticipate this transaction will add about $80 million in annual revenue. Medicaid health plans in Florida are currently engaged in discussions with the state regarding premium rates for the next fiscal year and some increases are expected. While premium rates in Florida have not kept pace with medical cost during the current rate year, we remain optimistic about our future in Florida. In fact, we believe that this is the right time to be acquiring other health plans in this market. After all, Florida is the fourth largest Medicaid market in the country. The acquisition of HealthPlus of Michigan is expected to add 90,000 Medicaid and 6000 CHIP members. This will increase our enrollment in Michigan by 40% and expand our geographic footprint by adding two additional counties in the central part of the state. We expect the transaction to add roughly $300 million in annual revenue. With the acquisition of MyCare Chicago, we are entering one of the largest Medicaid counties in the country. Cook county alone accounts for nearly half of the state’s 3.2 million Medicaid eligibles and gives us an opportunity for future growth. In addition to the long-term opportunity, this acquisitions brings in 60,000 additional members, increasing our enrollment in Illinois by 60%. And we expect the incremental revenue from this transaction to be $190 million on an annual basis. Combined, these transactions are expected to add an additional 180,000 new members and approximately $570 million in annualized revenue. While the impact to 2015 maybe small, given the anticipated closing dates, all transactions are expected to be accretive. And when combined with our enrollment from our start up and Puerto Rico, Medicaid expansion in the marketplace, we will have added 900,000 members by the end of the year. In-market acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy and highly accretive, helping us to expand margins in the future. This is because in-market acquisitions are generally asset purchases, provide us with additional scale and in some instances, a larger service footprint at a small marginal cost. We have considerable experience integrating these types of transactions as we have completed more than 10 asset purchases over the past decade. For the most part, speed to integration for these types of lower risk acquisitions coupled with our existing infrastructure, result in significant accretion value. The acquisition pipeline remains robust. Our recent equity offering and credit facility allow us to remain nimble and continue to take advantage of such opportunities as they arise. Changing gears, I want to briefly address the debt and budgetary challenges currently being faced by Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico pays our premiums weekly and is current with their payments. We will continue to monitor the situation there. We would like to welcome those of you that are new to Molina and to our story. We look forward to speaking with you about our business. We are committed to making a difference by providing compassionate care to those receiving government assistance and most in need of our help. We are pleased with our results so far and more broadly how they contribute to our longer term objectives. Now I will turn the call over to John.
John Molina: Thank you, Mario. Good afternoon, everyone. Today we reported net income of $0.72 per diluted share and adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.86. We are particularly pleased that we achieved these results by growing, both our top-line and our profit margins. As Mario briefly touched upon, premium revenue grew in excess of 50% compared with the second quarter of 2014 and our medical care ratio dropped by 60 basis points. This improved medical margin performance coupled with greater administrative cost efficiency and more complete reimbursement of the Affordable Care Act’s Health Insurer Fee or HIF. Our second quarter after tax margin grew to 1.1%. This is the first time in our company’s 35-year history that we have reported pretax income of $100 million for a quarter. Our second quarter results demonstrate the diversification of our business even as we remain focused on Medicaid related markets. Medical care ratios at nine of our health plans were lower this quarter than in the second quarter of 2014. Based on our results during the last two quarters, we expect that six of our health plans will each have revenues in excess of $2 billion by the end of the year. Pardon me, will have in excess of $1 billion by the end of the year. We also continued to make progress in securing reimbursement from the HIF. During the second quarter, we received a commitment to reimburse the fee from California, leaving only Michigan and Utah among our state plan partners that have not formally committed to reimbursement of the fee. During the second quarter, we recognized all of the 2014 HIF reimbursement due from California and half of the amount due for 2015. This amounted to $29 million, but because we are still not recognizing HIF reimbursement from Michigan and Utah, the net impact of the HIF reimbursement was only $12 million or $0.14 per diluted share favorable for the quarter. But I want to emphasize, the impact is actually $5 million or $0.06 per share unfavorable year-to-date. Since we are now largely caught up on the HIF corrections, we will cease reporting on this issue on a regular basis in future periods. Regarding Texas quality revenue, you will recall that since the beginning of 2014, about half of our total potential quality revenue is determined based upon performance measures for which we do not have historical information, clear definition or clarity around minimum standards. Through June of this year, this portion of our potential quality revenue amounted to about $32 million, $20 million for all of 2014 and $12 million for the first half of 2015. We will continue to defer recognition of this revenue until we get greater clarity from the state of Texas. I’ve already mentioned that our medical care ratio decreased 60 basis points in the second quarter of this year compared to the second quarter of 2014. Our medical care ratio was unchanged from the first quarter of 2015 at 88.7%. But if we exclude our Puerto Rico operations which was new this quarter, our medical care ratio fell 40 basis points to 88.3% from the first quarter of 2015. Our health plans generally report high MCRs in initial years’ operation and we attach no particular long term significance to Puerto Rico’s high medical care ratio this quarter. This point of our Puerto Rico leads another matter which I want to touch upon, the high degree of variability that occurs in the granular data that we provide. We will always share details of our individual health plan performance. Starting last quarter, we disclosed our revenue and medical care ratios by product line in order to further increase transparency. I want to repeat some things that I said on last quarter’s call. Financial information presented with this degree of granularity is inevitably subject to quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. Please use the detailed geographic and product line data to better understand our business tactics, our market opportunities and challenges and the complexities of our business. Use our consolidated results to understand our strategic goals and opportunities to weigh our performance over time and to form your own assessment of a long-term potential of our company. Getting back to the results, general and administrative expense ratio declined by 30 basis points when compared with the second quarter of 2014. Days in claims payable dropped slightly from the first quarter to second quarters from 50.52 days last quarter to 49.47 this quarter, a decrease of 1.05 days. However, we are up three days when compared to same period last year. As of June 30, 2015, the company had cash and investments of approximately $3.5 billion including in excess of $530 million at our parent company. During the second quarter, we issued 5.75 million shares of common stock, raising more than $370 million in net proceeds. As a result of the offering, our diluted weighted average shares outstanding have increased to just over 52 million shares for the six months ending June 2015. We expect diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 60 million for the third quarter and fourth quarters and approximately 56 million for the full year 2015. These estimates are consistent with the revised outlook we issued June 1st. During our road show for the secondary offering, we told investors that we were exploring a large number of potential acquisitions. As Mario discussed, we have been able to sign up three of those acquisitions. I want to remind everyone that these transactions are still going through the formal closing process and that we expect them to close during the third and fourth quarters of this year. As such these acquisitions will have limited impact on our 2015 results. Finally, I wanted to highlight that today marks a historic milestone in our industry. Medicaid turns 50 years old. On July 30, 1965, President, Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law the Medicaid and Medicare programs. Over the last five decades, these programs have transformed the nation’s healthcare system, protecting the health and well being of millions of families. As pay tribute to this event, we feel privileged that Molina Healthcare has played an active role in the programs, since our inception 35 years ago and we’re excited to continue shaping the future of the program by providing more people with access to quality healthcare. We look forward to talking to you again during our next Investor Day in New York on September 17th. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.
A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hello everybody. On the MLR for the first half, so you are at 88.7 and I think your full guidance is still 89.5, can you give us some of the factors that -- a sense on seasonality in the back half of the year, any other factors, does that MLR number now look increasingly conservative; any color?
John Molina: A.J., this is John. What I would say is we do have some seasonality Q4, but really the medical costs are coming in line a little bit faster than we expected but I wouldn’t draw any conclusions on what that first half of the year as to the second half of the year, because as we’ve talked about in the past, we’re not going to update guidance unless something material changes.
A.J. Rice: Right. And then similarly, this is my follow-up on the SG&A line, if I look at that, you’re 8.1 in the first half, your outlook for the year is 7.6, so in that one you need the back half to be quite bit strong or is that mainly just leverage or is there something else that would happen that would help you on that?
John Molina: It’d be continued leverage but I think the thing we have to look at with respect the admin ratio is, as we’ve discussed before, we have profit the caps, medical cost floors and those are achieved largely by reductions in revenue, but in the case of a marketplace for example while we may reduce the revenue for things like risk adjustments, the marketing costs, the broker commissions et cetera are flat. So as a percentage of the revenue, we get from marketplace, it’s higher. But I’d say all in all, both admin and medical claims are -- medical costs are coming in, in a way as Mario said that makes us very pleased.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.
Sarah James: I was wondering if you could walk us through some of the moving pieces in the quarter. So, as I think about MLR, were there any rate updates that came through and improved things sequentially; was there any benefit from a three-R true up? And then on that SG&A side, was there any impact all from either the financing transactions or due-diligence for M&A that impacted the quarter that wouldn’t be an ongoing cost?
John Molina: Okay. Sarah, this is John. Let me see if I can take those three questions now in order. On the MLR side, there were no rate increases. I think that the MLR is where it is because we’re doing good medical management. On the three Rs, there was no true up. And in terms of the SG&A, there was no significant increase either from the offering or from M&A.
Sarah James: Got it. And I guess just a follow-up excluding out the one-time items. On Texas, I think you guys had talked about in the past the state providing data finally last quarter to the plans and then there was a review or appeal process. So, where does that stand now as far as closing out…
John Molina: It’s like the John show; I’m getting all the questions. We actually hedged; there are two systems state provides to us to use and unfortunately the last time order from the state the two systems were in bit of a conflict. So, we have no further information other than state is rerunning the data and will get back to us as soon as they have good confirmation.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Tom Carroll: Hi guys. Good afternoon. Another follow-up on Texas while I’m thinking about it. The 32 million that you highlight, remind us again are you cash flowed that money or is that just money you are owed at some point in time. And secondly, in terms of the process, I guess you have some peers in the state that have recognized the fair amount of their share. So, should we take that as being -- maybe the probability is a bit higher that you will eventually recognize those dollars in the near future?
Joseph White: To your first question, that’s not a cash flow issue for us. The state, if they were to take money back would have to take money back from us if we miss the measure. So, it’s not a cash flow issue. To the second point, obviously we don’t know what are peers are doing in the state but from our perspective, the quality measures break into two broad categories, about half of them we have which are HEDIS based measures, we have good insight to and we’ve been recognizing revenue associated with those measures. It’s just these other measures that we don’t have insight to that we’re not recognizing revenue. So for us, it splits out about 50-50 of the potential. I don’t know what our peers are doing obviously.
Tom Carroll: So on the 32 million, half of that you’ve recognized or half you could, you have better visibility on?
Joseph White: That 32 million is what is unrecognized. So, if you take the potential, it would have been around 64 million. We’ve recognized 32 and there is another 32 out there.
Tom Carroll: And then just for clarification, the health insurer fee items, those are all contemplated as part of your outlook this year. Correct?
John Molina: That’s correct.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Cornelia Miller: This is Cornelia in for Andy. I guess just focusing on Florida for a second, the MLR fell more than 600 basis points quarter-to-quarter. Was that all driven by your marketplace numbers, or did you see any improvement in MMA as well?
John Molina: No, it’s marketplace. This is John.
Cornelia Miller: And then can you just remind us what you’ve included in guidance for a rate increase in Florida?
John Molina: In January we’re expecting 3%.
Cornelia Miller: Okay. And then just following up on the marketplace MLR, obviously down significantly to 55.4%. It sounds like that’s not related to any three R true-ups; is there anything else going on in the quarter that we should be thinking about? I mean all these Florida members are super profitable, or…
Joseph White: In general, we’ve been seeing very good experience on the marketplace. As far as three R true-ups we’re helped in a few of our states because of credibility of factors where we’re not having to accrue MLR get backs. But we’ve actually got a nice table on the three Rs at the very end of our 10Q where you can see how we’re positioned for 2015. I think in general though it’s fair to say that pretty much across the board, the marketplaces have come in very well for us this year.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Mary Shang: This is Mary Shang in for Josh this afternoon. So, you clearly saw some significant initial enrollment in Puerto Rico. Was this enrollment that you saw in line with your expectations and could you may be provide some more color on the cost trends of these members so far? 
John Molina: The enrollment is right where we expected to be. Remember in Puerto Rico we are serving two regions and we are the only health plan in those two regions. So, if you are on Medicaid in either of those regions, you are a member of Molina. In terms of cost trends, just a little early to say anything; we’ve got three months worth of experience. So, when we have more to report at the end of the third quarter and certainly going into the fourth quarter.
Mary Shang: You’ve been active with your recent acquisitions in Florida, Illinois, Michigan. Could you just provide some more color around what the future pipeline looks for you? I know you mentioned Florida health plans in your prepared remarks.
John Molina: Sure. We are seeing smaller health plans just like the three that we talked about today, provider sponsored plans that realize they want to focus on being providers for us and not being in health plan business. And as we’ve discussed in the past we’re also looking at companies that can help broaden our service capabilities.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Peter Costa: The marketplace MLR is so low, 70% or so for the first six months. Do you think that that is something that’s going to trigger the medical loss ratio minimums in that category or is that being accounted for correctly already?
John Molina: Peter, in some states it will, as Joe mentioned in some states there is credibility factors which have a different effect. But we’re confident that we are accruing everything correctly for the marketplace.
Peter Costa: So we shouldn’t expect that to go higher going forward as you see the performance continue be good if you will.
Joseph White: I think as we leave the protection, if you will, the credibility factors as the plans get bigger, we could obviously see higher MCRs.
Peter Costa: And then sort of on the same MLR line but different business, the California MLR continues trend a little bit worse. I know you have a lot of improvement in almost every other state but just focusing on California where it did deteriorate again, do you expect that to continue to deteriorate or do you think that can start to improve from here?
John Molina: This is John. I think it will start to improve.
Peter Costa: And do you want to give any color on why?
John Molina: I was waiting for you to ask me that question. We are seeing more of our members go into our own delivery system. We’ve seen -- that has at least two effects. We do know that in our own clinics we tend to get patients with more chronic illnesses, so until we get the risk scores and everything turned around there, I think that we’ll see a little bit higher MCR, we also have some hospital contracts that we’re in the process of renegotiating which are a bit higher than we like them to be.
Peter Costa: So, can you give us a timeframe on when some of that stuff will start to hit?
John Molina: Probably early next year.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Dave Windley: If I take your year-to-date performance and then tack on the, say the net benefit from the HIF that you haven’t collected in the first six months and from everything you’ve said so far, it doesn’t sound like there is significant negative seasonality in the back half. So, if I kind of annualize your number, you are running pretty significantly above your 235 guidance. I know to A.J.’s question you kind of mentioned materiality. Is it still not material enough to make a change on guidance?
Dr. Mario Molina: This is Mario. We said at the beginning of the year that we were going to provide annual guidance unless there was a material change. Earlier this year when we did the stock offering, we did update the guidance because of the change in the share count. But at this point we are going to stick by our policy of providing annual guidance. The number is what it is. The performance is running better than what we had forecast.
Dave Windley: Alright, so moving on then, a couple of maybe organic opportunities in Iowa where I think you are bidding and then Michigan where you’re going to close an acquisition and there is opportunity there or re-procurement there. I’m wondering what your views are on opportunity to win and/or defend position as the case maybe?
Dr. Mario Molina: This is Mario. We obviously feel pretty good about Michigan. As far as Iowa goes, I wouldn’t care to speculate at this point. We submitted what we think was a good response and we will just have to see how the scoring and the awards come out.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Steve Baxter: Hi. This is actually Steve Baxter on for Kevin. I just want to clarify the HIF commentary just to put a fine point on it. The $0.14 when you flagged that in the press release, that’s the amount of revenue you recognized not related to the second quarter of 2015. So if we were trying to think of a run rate, $0.14 is the right number to adjust?
John Molina: That’s correct.
Steve Baxter: And I guess I’d love to get a little bit of an update on the duals population. I know you caution against too much quarter-to-quarter MLR comparisons but it looks like the MLR jumped up a little bit there. I guess any color on that would be great. And I guess just ongoing dialogue with the states to kind of improve the sustainability of that program would be of interest as well.
Dr. Mario Molina: With regard to the MMP contracts, I think the results right now are lumpy and that’s for a couple of reasons. First of all, we’re getting a lot of new enrollment and the numbers are still small. So until things stabilize, I think you will see fluctuations. The other thing is that depending on the state, in some cases, our medical costs are higher than anticipated on the Medicare side whereas in other states the costs have come in a little higher than anticipated on the Medicaid or the LTSS services. And some of that is a function of our experience with those services. But I think that as John pointed out, I wouldn’t read too much into it at this point. The numbers are small, things are still in flux. And it’s going to be a while before everything I think settles out. Generally speaking, it takes nine months to a year for things to kind of stabilize. So don’t read too much into the quarter-to-quarter numbers.
Steve Baxter: I guess just one question on the exchanges. It seems like you have a significant amount of room to re-price that business to kind of get to a margin that might be a little more sustainable and won’t really put you up against all the three R corridors. Can you talk about what your expectations are for growth around that program over the next couple of years and how that might impact your government comp tax susceptibility?
John Molina: We don’t anticipate being able to adopt the executive comp starting next year because the marketplace has been successful for us. We like the product and are going to continue to try and grow it the way we did in 2015.
Steve Baxter: I guess that just begs the question then on do you have a sense of what the adjustment would look like to your tax rate?
Joseph White: I think it was around 40 bps but obviously our tax rate has been in such flux lately that I’m not sure you can really adjust that very easily. But I believe it was around 40 bps when we talked about it last year.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink. Please go ahead.
Ana Gupte: Just following up again on the marketplace, why is it that you are doing so well? I’m just curious why is it that your margins are so good? And it seems like for Medicaid players in general as compared to players like Humana which generally in the same states as well, not just in California, seem to be in trouble. Is it because you are contracting on Medicaid networks whereas they are not or I’m just curious what’s going on?
Dr. Mario Molina: It’s difficult question for us to answer. What I can say is that our strategy was to offer products that would be attractive to people who are at the lower end of the FPL, so maybe upto about 250% of poverty and that we wanted to build this as an extension of Medicaid. So that people who were coming off of Medicaid, the so called churn would be able to stay with their health plans, stay with their doctor. That’s how we’ve designed the products. I can’t tell you why there is a difference between us and some of the other health plans. But we had a strategy. I also think that we were conservative going in and that’s allowed us to lower our rats a little bit in the second year. So far our strategy is holding. We’ll see what it does in the third year.
Ana Gupte: So it’s partly maybe not just the networks but you’re targeting a certain segment of that subsidized population, it sounds like. And just following up on that, when I look at the 2016 proposed rates and I expect you all are still in the negotiating phase of the HIF marketplaces. You are filing for something on average that looks like a rate reduction probably and I may not have all the states and all but somewhere in the 8ish percent range. And is that to kind of get to the more normalized sustainable state or am I missing some data somewhere?
John Molina: The ability to have affordable products for the population that Mario talked about is very important and core to the mission of the company. So, our ability to lower the price going into next year was very important and with the balance being able to lower our costs for our members and making sure that we have the right margin on the business. I don’t know if it was 8% across the board or what but it was our goal to balance those two items.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Brian Wright with Sterne, Agee CRT. Please go ahead.
Brian Wright: Two real quick ones. On the California PMPM, I just would have thought that with the health insurance fee accrual this quarter, it would’ve been a bit higher, because I mean even with that it’s down year-over-year, so is there anything one-timeish in the revenue that’s driving that?
Joseph White: Brian, I don’t know if it’s one-timeish but remember last year there was the PCP parity and then also we had some retroactive adjustments to our MMP rates in California sort of normal course reconciliation that hit this quarter.
John Molina: Brian, also if you’re looking at the revenue in the detail, we exclude the HIF from that.
Brian Wright: And then lastly, it looks like CMS is allowing the states to have the option to extend the duals pilots another two years. I was just curious if you had spoken to California and kind of gotten their lenience on that option.
John Molina: We haven’t started to engage with the state obviously. We put a lot of effort into the MMP programs across all the states and so we like to see the programs continue. But we’re not going to speak for the state Medicaid agencies.
Dr. Mario Molina: And let me just add, this is Mario. I think that it’s really appropriate to extend these pilots because the truth of the matter is some of them got started late and three years is a very short time to really analyze the effectiveness. By the time you get all the data and then try to analyze it, you’re talking about probably two to three years anyway. So, I think the three year timeframe was pretty short to do a really good analysis of the value of these new MMP programs. It makes sense to extend them.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Christopher Benassi: Congrats on another great quarter. This is Christopher Benassi on for Matthew Borsch. With all the industry consolidation that has been occurring, could you touch on where Molina sits within the managed care ecosystem and how you are strategically positioned? And just following that up, do think the push for scale has been overemphasized?
Dr. Mario Molina: This is Mario. Let me take a minute on that. I think that the way things are settling out, Molina is turning out to be the purest of the pure plays that we are really focused on our mission which is to serve low income patients who receive some form of government assistance with their healthcare premiums. As you can see from the acquisitions that we have done, we continue to grow; we’re going to add 900,000 members this year. We have a lot of opportunity in front of us in Medicaid and especially when it comes to programs like the duals and the long-term care services. So there is plenty of room for us to grow, lots of accretive opportunities in front us and that’s I think where we sit in the sort of managed care ecosystem.
Christopher Benassi: And just to dovetail off that, would you maybe be willing to touch on any areas you’d be interested in expanding into geographically and how do you think you’ll be positioned for any divestitures in the upcoming consolidation -- in the upcoming wave of consolidation?
Dr. Mario Molina: Clearly we’re interested in Georgia and Iowa. We remain interested in states that have significant managed care opportunities in Medicaid. We are looking at companies for acquisitions that might give us capabilities that we don’t currently have. And as far as divestures go, the fact that we have the equity offering behind us now and the line of credit, we’re well poised to take advantage and move quickly in opportunities that they may arise.
Christopher Benassi: And I guess one more quick follow-up as well. Where would you feel comfortable with your debt to cap? You screen towards the bottom end of our coverage and you have a great balance sheet, so just kind of curious around that.
Dr. Mario Molina: I think that after the equity offering, we’re pretty happy with where we are right now.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Gary Taylor with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. 
Gary Taylor: Most of my questions have been answered. I actually just have one small clarification from a question earlier. Did I hear correctly that you said the sequential year-over-year improvement in the Florida medical loss ratio was mostly due to the performance of marketplace plans, is that correct?
John Molina: That’s correct Gary.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.
Chris Rigg: Mario, just a follow-up on what you said a few minutes ago about potentially buying capabilities that you don’t have. Does that theoretically mean if some Medicare Advantage assets came up for sale, you guys would take a look?
Dr. Mario Molina: I think that we would be willing to take a look at Medicare Advantage assets, sure. We’d be looking at Medicare, Medicaid other companies that could fill in parts of our business portfolio in the area of long-term care services; there is a variety of things. We wouldn’t necessarily shy away from Medicare Advantage.
Chris Rigg: This is really just a follow-up on at least two questions that have been asked with regard to guidance. I guess when I look at the year-to-date MCR and the year-to-date G&A, then look back where you’re at guidance wise, is it just conservatism in the outlook or are you actually indeed looking for a big step down on an absolute basis of G&A and the MCR to bump in a very meaningful way in the last half of the year?
Dr. Mario Molina: I would say that we tend to be conservative, if you look at the way we’ve handle things like the Texas pay for performance revenue and some of these other things, we tend to be on the conservative side and we would rather be that way; same thing with the health insurance fees. We think that health insurance tax will ultimately all be paid and we’ve assumed that in our guidance but we haven’t recognized all of it yet. So, we tend to be conservative.
Chris Rigg: Got it. And I appreciate that but on the MCR in particular, is there anything that we should know about that actually is going to drive that meaningfully higher in the back half of the year or we should just take the conservative commentary on its face?
Dr. Mario Molina: There are no events that we’re aware of right now that I think will drive the MCR higher. John did mention there is some seasonality. We typically see higher medical costs in the fourth and first quarters of the year. But aside from that, no. We continue to work on the MMP and the Medicare costs but nothing out of the ordinary.
Operator: The next question is follow up from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Tom Carroll: Just a few others here just to think about. So, on Texas, the $32 million, how do you expect that to hit the bottom-line, should it come into play? Is this just a tax adjustment and the rest of it falls right to the bottom line and is it around $0.30 a share? Is that what you think about?
Joseph White: Whatever comes in would be a direct increase to pretax income. So, there is no offset in terms of expenses or anything.
Tom Carroll: And then secondly, somewhat conceptual; in Utah and Michigan, the Affordable Care Act rolled out 18 months ago, we’ve had visibility on this thing now for what five years. I can’t believe it’s been that long. What do you think the holdup is in these two markets; are these guys just stringing you along for another few months and then eventually it’s going to hit or maybe give us some sense of what you think these markets are -- what are they thinking?
John Molina: I don’t think that either state is intentionally staying there so long. In both Michigan and Utah, the dollars have been passed through the budget by the legislatures. But in fairness, there is a lot of stuff going on in both of those states. Michigan is putting out a new RFP; Utah is taking about expansion of Medicaid. And what we’re waiting for is the contractual language, the contracts amendment to solidify that. So, we are very comfortable that the both states intend to pay us in the future and we’re being patient. And that’s why again it’s becoming a smaller and smaller issue. So we’re happy not to talk about it anymore.
Dr. Mario Molina: Tom, is the question about the health insurance fee or Medicaid expansion?
Tom Carroll: The health insurance fee, the fee side of things.
Dr. Mario Molina: Okay. I misunderstood. Thanks.
Tom Carroll: John I won’t ask you about it anymore. And then lastly on your acquisitions, I think you said they were going to be accretive but where do you expect these to operate in 2016? Are these operating in line with your broader organization in terms operating margin or is there going to be some further ramp in year one where you’ve got to get in there with the Molina secret sauce and get it going?
John Molina: Since these are in-market or “bolt-on acquisitions”, they tend to perform slightly better than company average but we’ll get into the accretion numbers etcetera in 2016 at our normal Investor Day A.
Tom Carroll: Great. Thank you very much. That’s what I was looking for.
Operator: Okay. Gentlemen, there are no other questions left in the queue. I’ll turn it back to you. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.
Dr. Mario Molina: Great. Thank you. Well everyone, we hope that you will have a good summer what’s left of it and look forward to seeing you again at the Investor Day in New York in September.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Juan Jose. Hello, everyone and thank you for joining our call today. I will speak for a few minutes on our start for the year and then hand the call over to John who will provide a financial summary of the quarter. Molina is off to an excellent start in 2015, and I am very pleased with our current trajectory and progress. We delivered 38% enrollment growth and 53% revenue growth, which together resulted in net income that was about six times higher than the first quarter of 2014. This success underscores the current growth opportunities of our business, and validates our strategic push to diversify into new markets and new programs to manage the healthcare of complex patients, and to leverage our administrative infrastructure. All of this without ever losing sight of quality. Today's results establish a solid foundation for us to build upon as we set our sights on our targets for the year, and to achieve our long-term goals and objectives. During the first quarter, strong membership growth continued as we increased enrollment by 342,000 members sequentially, growing to nearly three million members across all of our markets. Arranging healthcare services for three million members is no simple task. So I want to take this opportunity to congratulate all of our employees on this milestone achievement. But more importantly, I want to thank them for their hard work, and for remaining grounded by always keeping in mind our humble beginnings in a single clinic. Thank you. We are currently operating in one of the most exciting periods in the history of Medicaid managed care, two of the fastest growing programs in the managed care industry. The dual eligible demonstration and the expansion of Medicaid are core areas of focus at Molina. As individuals in these programs transition into managed care, the demands for our services will continue to increase. Our dual eligible membership increased by nearly 90% sequentially, fueled by the three health plans that began operations under this program last year, California, Illinois and Ohio. Many of you listening to this call have been keenly interested in the opt-out rates for our duals programs. We continue to experience a consolidated opt-out rate of about 50%, consistent with the number we have shared in the past. Medicaid expansion membership grew by 50,000 new members during the first quarter and by 300,000 when compared to the same period one year-ago. This product has been and continues to be an area of significant growth for the company. The health plans that we operate in states that chose to expand their Medicaid programs experienced significant growth. For example our health plans in California and Washington have each added more than 100,000 new expansion members since the beginning of 2014. And Michigan, New Mexico and Ohio have each added more than 50,000 expansion members as well. However, Texas and Florida, two states with large numbers of people without health insurance continue to refrain from expanding their Medicaid program. While lawmakers continue their debate over Medicaid expansion, managed care remains an important value and cost savings proposition. In terms of new markets, our health plan in Puerto Rico went live on April 1, as we welcomed 350,000 new members in the East and Southwest regions of the Commonwealth. I had a chance to visit with our employees at our offices in San Juan right before the launch and I was very impressed with their efforts to bring up the business under a very compressed timeframe. From our recent experience in large managed care implementations in Florida, Illinois, South Carolina and Texas we have learned that anytime large numbers of beneficiaries are transitioned into a new program, lack of awareness and confusion are always present among members and providers in the near-term. Therefore in keeping with past practice we expect to record higher medical costs in Puerto Rico during the onset of the implementation until we have our own claims data. Now let's talk a little bit about premium rates. As we think about some of our concerns from last year the rate environment immediately comes to mind. We continue to view rates in general as an ongoing headwind, especially for members in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families category or TANF. The good news is that the rate relief in the Aged, Blind and Disabled category or ABD, as demonstrated in our New Mexico and Washington health plans provides us with some comfort that these issues will be mitigated and resolved over time. Another issue of concern last year was the reimbursement of the Affordable Care Act health insurer fee by our state partners. While not all states have formally committed to reimbursement of the health insurer fee for 2015 we remain confident of full reimbursement. As I mentioned previously, I am very pleased with our results for the quarter as our revenue and membership growth have maintained the momentum that we developed in 2014. I remain excited about the continued opportunities we are seeing and the progress we are making as we continue positioning the company for success. I would now like to turn the call over to John.
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Mario, and hello, everyone. Today we reported net income per diluted share from continuing operations of $0.56. Additionally, we're reporting adjusted net income per diluted share from continuing operations of $0.71. Both numbers represent significant improvements over our results for the first quarter of 2014 and we are all very pleased with our performance. The first quarter was notable for several key reasons. First we continue to see robust top line growth. We added more than 340,000 new members over the course of the quarter with almost three-quarters of those new members coming through the Marketplace. As we have said previously, we took a deliberate and measured approach toward the Marketplace in 2014 given the many uncertainties. For 2015 we refined our pricing based on 2014 experience and concentrated our network development. These efforts resulted in significant membership growth during the first quarter. Florida is our largest Marketplace health plan with 185,000 members while our Wisconsin health plan has about 25,000 Marketplace members and California has nearly 20,000. While we are still early in the year our cost and utilization experience so far suggests that our Marketplace business for 2015 is priced appropriately. Second, top line growth reflects our growing diversity both geographically and across different programs. In order to help you better understand that diversity we are for the first time disclosing in today's earnings release, our revenue and medical care ratios by product line. I caution everyone that financial information presented with this degree of granularity is subject to quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. This is the same situation as with the health plan specific information that we've always provided. I urge you to use the detailed geographical and product line data to better understand our business tactics, our market opportunities and challenges and the complexities of our business. But use our consolidated results to understand our strategic goals and opportunities, to weigh our performance over time and to form your own assessment of the long-term potential of our company. Third, we've gained traction, for the time being, at least, in our efforts to control medical care costs. Our medical care ratio for the first quarter was the same as it was a year ago, and down 70 basis points sequentially. Fourth, administrative cost leverage is improving our profitability. Finally, we achieved strong first quarter results, despite the continued drag on earnings from the ACA health insurer fee and Texas quality revenue. Of course there are always challenges. As we've said before, increases to our base premiums in recent years have not kept pace with medical cost trends. And we continue to give back revenue due to limitations on medical margins for some programs, even as we suffer unacceptably low medical margins in other programs. Now for some additional details: Premium revenue grew 53% from a year ago and 14% from the fourth quarter of 2014. While additional memberships certainly contributes to revenue growth, membership is only one component of the overall revenue growth story. Per member per month premium revenue has increased by 15% over the last year as a result of additional membership in higher premium groups such as Medicaid expansion, the dual eligibles, Aged, Blind and Disabled populations and Marketplace. Turning to medical costs, our consolidated medical care ratio remained flat year-over-year at 88.7%, and declined by 70 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2014. As always, our health plan financial data disclosure, and now our product line financial data disclosure present a complex picture. To reiterate what I said a minute ago, it is our consolidated financial performance that tells you where we're headed. With that said, here are some general observations on our medical cost performance. First, premium rates for our MMP plans in California, Illinois and Ohio appear for now to be adequate to support the costs associated with those programs. Let me remind you that the MMP are the fully integrated duals programs. Of course we are unable to comment at the moment on our MMP programs in Michigan, South Carolina or Texas, which have just been launched. Second, we have seen some margin relief for the Aged, Blind and Disabled line of business in Washington and New Mexico, although not for the long-term care benefit attached to the ABD population in New Mexico. We are experiencing margin compression in the TANF line of business, as Mario said, particularly in the states of New Mexico, Washington, Florida and Utah. This is consistent with what we've said previously about base premium rates not keeping pace with increases in medical costs. Third the Medicaid expansion and Marketplace lines of business are for now experiencing lower medical care ratios than our other lines of business. Fourth on a consolidated basis prior period development did not have a significant impact on our results. Although we reported a benefit from prior period development in the quarter of $136 million approximately $25 million of that favorable development was offset by reductions to revenue as the result of medical cost floors and corridors. Once you strip out the PPD that resulted in offsetting adjustments to revenue our metrics look very similar to the first quarters of 2013 and 2012 because we strive to maintain consistent reserving methodologies and do not believe that prior period development had a material impact on our consolidated results. Days in Claims Payable increased sequentially from December by 2 days to 51 days and by 5 days from the first quarter 2014. As we've said before diversification across geographers and product lines allows us to mitigate the variations in contribution by market and product. This is particularly important as we continue to grow and expand our business. Not only have we been able to diversify on a geographic basis but product line diversification has also provided us with additional stability and opportunity. First quarter results continue to show the benefits of the administrative cost leverage that we have discussed in the past. As noted in our earnings release and our 10-Q, administrative costs associated with the startup of our Puerto Rico health plan, Marketplace broker commissions and Marketplace exchange fees resulted in a general and administrative expense ratio that was higher than in the fourth quarter of 2014. Absent these costs associated with Puerto Rico and our Marketplace build out our administrative cost ratio would have been approximately 7.4% for the quarter, this is consistent with our expectations. We believe a key comparison to make is with our general and administrative expense ratio for the first quarter of 2014 which was a full percentage point higher than our G&A ratio for the first quarter this year. I am pleased that we achieved good results this quarter despite headwinds from the lack of full Affordable Care Act health insurer fee reimbursement and our decision to defer recognition of quality revenue related to Texas. In the first quarter of 2014 we did not record reimbursement for the 2015 health insurer fee in California, Michigan and Utah reducing our first quarter income by approximately $16 million or $0.20 per diluted share. Nor do we recognize any of the outstanding health insurer fee reimbursement related to 2014 which stood at approximately $20 million as of March 31, 2015. We remain confident that all states will eventually reimburse us for the health insurer fee, but the timing of our revenue recognition remains uncertain. To that point, the state of California has just reimbursed us for our 2014 health insurer fee. So we will be recognizing that revenue in the second quarter. We still do not have formal documentation of California's intent to reimburse us for the 2015 health insurance fee. So we don't know when we'll be able to recognize 2015 health insurer fee reimbursement from California. We're only recognizing a portion of the Texas Health Plan's quality revenue for the first quarter of 2015 due to the lack of clarity around the methodology of the calculations. We have discussed this previously. As a result, about $7 million of the approximately $9 million of quality revenue available in Texas for the first quarter of 2015, which is equivalent to about $0.09 per diluted share, was not recognized this quarter. Nor do we recognize any quality related revenue from 2014 during the first quarter of this year. The balance from 2014 is $20 million. The import of this discussion is that our first quarter results for 2015 would have been $0.29 better had we been in a position to recognize these last two items. You will notice that our convertible debt, due February of 2020, has been reclassified as a short-term liability effective March 31, 2015, and that the related derivative asset and liability have also been reclassified as current. Because of the sharp increase in our share price, the stock price trigger allowing conversion of the notes into cash has occurred. No notes have been presented to us for conversion. And the notes continue to trade at a price in excess of the value that could be realized by a note holder upon conversion. The excess in value of the notes over the conversion value reflects the value of the coupon rate attached to the notes, and the optionality value of the conversion feature over the remaining life of the notes. As of March 31, 2015, the company had cash and investments in excess of $3 billion, including in excess of $200 million at the parent. We've also made some changes to the methodology by which we calculate adjusted net income and related per share amounts. Specifically, we're no longer subtracting depreciation and amortization of capitalized software and share based compensation from net income to arrive at adjusted net income and the related per share amount. We made this change to better reflect the way in which we evaluate our financial performance, making financing and business decisions, and forecasts and plan for the future periods. In addition, we believe this calculation makes our adjusted net income more comparable to our peers. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP calculation has been included in today's release and is available there for your review. Finally and as a reminder from our Investor Day presentation, we only provide guidance annually and we don't intend to change guidance unless there's an event that has a material impact on our business. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. And our first question is from Sarah James with Wedbush. Please proceed.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thank you. And congratulations on the strong quarter. It looks like without a few of the delays it would have been even further above consensus. So I just appreciate the new detail on the product MLR and it's a new metric so I was hoping we could get a little bit more context. I was looking at the TANF, CHIP, MLR compared to kind of the range that you guys gave at Investor Day of high 80s for 2014 and 2015 and there's a little bit of gap there between where first quarter is and where the years' were. And I was hoping you could talk about maybe how non-recognition of the ACA fee or rate updates expected later in the year may be kind of skewing this quarter off of what you had previously talked about annually?
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: So, Sarah, this is John. I think while we still continue to grow and get very big we can't forget about seasonality and I think you're looking at one quarter and comparing it to our entire year so that's going to be the big difference. I don't think that the recognition of the ACA fee is going to have anything to do with – or much to do with that and the Texas quality revenue is primarily in the ABD population so if anything, would benefit the ABD population some. But again short answer is seasonality.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got it. And then could you remind us how you guys are thinking about share count with respect to your existing guidance? What's in there as far as share count or treatment of the convert?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Sure, Sarah. It's Joe speaking. I think for guidance we were at around 50 million – I think we were around 50 million which is where we ended up for this quarter, I think we were like at 51 million this quarter. The way I would look at it is once you cross $53 in share price, increment about 250,000 shares on a full year basis. Obviously you've got to weight it for the weighted average over the days. But about 225,000 shares to 250,000 shares per $1 over $53. So you can take what we gave you and then peg your estimate of where our share price is going to be for the year and adjust it accordingly.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. Appreciate that, Joe. Thanks.
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Sure.
Operator: And our next question is from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please proceed.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. I know you don't update guidance, but I'm just curious, did 1Q come in better than your estimates? I mean obviously above the Street. But how did that compare to your previous expectations?
J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hello, Josh. This is Mario. As we said at the outset, we're going to provide annual guidance. So for us to comment on the quarter-to-quarter development would in effect be giving quarterly guidance. So we're not going to comment on that aspect.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. I'll skip that one. Second question...
J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: On the other hand...
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yep?
J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: On the other hand, as I said in my remarks, I'm very pleased with the company's performance so far.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. I will add very pleased to the rest of the year I guess. Texas performance payments, so for the 2014 year, what are you still – the $20 million that you're waiting on, what metrics or what information are you waiting on to see if you can actually record those? And have you been able to rule? I know you're not – you haven't been able to recognize any of that. But have you been able to rule out any of it? Were there any metrics that you don't think you hit?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: It's Joe speaking. We know we definitely missed $4 million in Texas last year. So there's another $20 million out there. And it's the – you know it's the same story, Josh. We're just waiting to hear how the state has calculated through its third party, how it has calculated the metrics versus how we've calculated.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And you don't – so you can't just rely on your own calculations. You've got to wait until...?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: No. No, because it's a very complex calculation subject to a lot of interpretation. And it's also dependent on other health plan performance.
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: Josh, this is John. This is the biggest thing is, it's rank ordered against other health plans. So until we know how they did, our internal data is only half the picture.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got you. So you may know how you did, right, but that doesn't help you in the calculations. And then just the last one on the health insurer's exchange, you know the MLR in the quarter under 81% seems relatively low for a new entrant and big growth, et cetera. Can you talk a little bit about how you're accruing the claims? And then if there's any three Rs assumption? I don't want to preempt Joe's September presentation, I'm sure that's coming but curious what the accruals are.
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: What we're finding so far, Josh, and this is the beginning of the year – what we're finding though is that utilization is less than we anticipated. Pretty much substantially less which would suggest that there could conceivably be a – there could conceivable be a risk adjustment downward – adjustment to revenue but we think we've captured that in the calculations of the risk adjustment in the MLR floor and all of that. So I think in general it's fair to say we don't have any big receivables booked back on anything like risk adjustment.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Do you have any payables then, Joe?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: No. We haven't – I think it's fair to say that we anticipate that and we've worked that into our calculation of the anticipated MLR. I don't want go into details about whether we've got that booked as a higher medical claims liability or a risk adjustment liability but the exercise gets you to the same point. In a nutshell experience is coming in much less, so far much lower than we anticipated.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. I mean but just so I understand it's coming in much lower but you don't have a payable?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: We've adjusted – the best way to express this is between the claims reserved we recorded and the risk adjustment liability we've recorded, we think we're very nicely positioned.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Got you. It accrued over...
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Yeah. I guess what I'm trying to say, Josh, is we don't anything substantial in the way of receivables and we anticipate, yes, there will payables to put back on risk adjustment.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please proceed.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Great. Thanks. I guess maybe just following up on that one, so I think you said that you think you've priced appropriately so I guess based on that last comment we should be thinking that the exchanges are tracking to profit this year so far?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: In our case, yes.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then just on the Medicaid expansion MLR, can you talk a little bit about the MLR in the quarter? I know some states or many states have these rebate floors, wasn't sure if there was anything seasonality where you book the rebate floors more in the back half and so we should expect MLR to rise as the year goes on? Or whether this captures that number and this number might be in some ways sustainable?
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: This is John, Kevin. I think on the expansion the things you have to consider are the rates changed. And in many cases, we discussed this at the Investor Day, the rates – the premium rates dropped quite a bit. So if the MLR goes up, it largely is a function of the revenue per member going down. And then the methodology that different states use to calculate, either the floors or the give-backs are different. So that's going to have a little bit of an impact. And lastly, the time horizon, especially for a state like California, the measurement period's over 18 months as opposed to 12 months. So I think what we see in Q1 it's good. It might rise a little bit. I don't expect it to go shooting through the roof, but I don't expect it to drop much more.
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Yeah. I would just add to that we've had 15 months of experience now with this population. So I think we've got a pretty good handle on the MLR corridors and floors. I don't think there's any snapback in that we would anticipate.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And the number – because I mean we normally think about floors being in that kind of mid-80 or low-80 range if you're at 77.5. So can you just remind us maybe how much of your states have floors, versus don't have floors there?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: It's Joe speaking. They all have some sort of what the states call risk mitigation, strategies, some kind of risk corridor. Remember, though, that the definitions of revenue and expense in those calculations don't match what we show on a GAAP income statement. So oftentimes our revenue is reduced by certain items, and expense can be adjusted too so that the net effect of that is often an MLR floor that is slightly different than that which you would calculate from GAAP.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Because I guess the reason that I ask is that obviously you've got a state in Kentucky who's looking to kind of rebid that contract pretty quickly because people were doing well there. And I know you're not there, but just trying to make sure. So you think that kind of where you are, or even in California this past year where there was a big rate cut, you kind of think where you are is more in line with directionally where the MLR floors – or do you think that there's rate risk to that over time?
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: I didn't hear the last part of your question. There's what over time?
Kevin M. Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I was just saying there's rate and risk to that number over time and that states may additionally look to bring that MLR up. Or whether this MLR is generally in line with kind of where the corridors would put you on a GAAP adjusted basis?
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. I think that the states are taking the same approach. Their actuaries are looking at the data, utilization, expected trends, et cetera, and they're pricing it accordingly. They weren't as much in the dark as we were in the first year. And as Joe says, as we get more data, we would expect that the rates will be adjusted to be more in line with what the actual experience is.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks very much...
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Which is what we saw starting January 1, of this year.
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: Right.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question is from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Cornelia Miller - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. This Cornelia in for Andy. I guess just first it looks like your commercial revenues related to the exchanges were 7% of total premiums in the quarter. Do you think you'll still qualify for the de minimis rule?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: It's Joe speaking. We'll have to see how that plays out over the year. I would just – the only commentary I would make on this is we run this business on an operating basis not a tax basis. And we're not going to adjust our business strategy directly for a tax strategy but we'll have to see how the year plays out. But agree we're above the de minimis threshold first quarter.
Cornelia Miller - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just to come back to the Texas quality payments. So I just want to make sure the 2015 outlook only assumed you received 80% of the 2015 payments, is that correct?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Mechanically that's correct. The guidance we gave assumed 80% recovery of the 2015 amount and nothing for 2014.
Cornelia Miller - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And it now looks like you're sort of tracking similarly to 2014 at this point in the year.
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: It's difficult to say after one quarter. We're certainly bluntly still in the dark on the metrics that we haven't heard about from 2014 as we go into 2015. But also the portion of the revenue that's tied to HEDIS scores, we've found it very difficult to recognize that in the first quarter until our data develops further. So I guess I would just say I don't see anything happening in the first quarter that's going to take us off of what we said in guidance.
Cornelia Miller - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: Sure.
Operator: Our next question is from Brian Wright with Sterne, Agee, CRT. Please proceed.
Brian M. Wright - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning – good morning, geez. Good evening. So one real quick question, if one has a view that the stock price goes to $90 what's the cap on the conversion? The incremental kind of share count?
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: I mean the total – I want to say the total shares underlying the 2020 convert, Brian, are about 13.5 million and then I want to say – I want to say it's something like five million shares underlying the 2014 convert. I mean I haven't done the math to know what happens at a given share price. And I think it's unrealistic we'd ever reach those numbers. But I think it's $13.5 million on the 2020 and $5.5 million on the 2044.
Brian M. Wright - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: Okay. I'll follow up with you after on some of the details on how to calculate it. Thanks.
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: Okay. Looking forward to it. Thanks.
Operator: And a question from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please proceed.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Yes. Thanks. Good evening. I wanted to follow up on I think some of the questions around MLR particularly. So as I look at your – now you have all the membership disclosed by product. A lot of the new growth is Medicaid expansion and the Marketplaces. So it seems like a lot of the new business, they're probably running at a higher MLR than kind of the existing ABDs and duals where there's not much growth, and after 2016 levels sort of anniversary. So how do you think about what the normalized loss ratio should be across your book of business? And this year you're getting a nice lift, I would imagine, from some of these higher margin businesses, lower MLR. How does that look as you go forward? And what type of improvement are you seeing in your existing ABD and duals populations as far as normalizing the MLR?
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: Ana, give us a minute. We're going back to take a look at what we said at the Investor Day. I think the important thing is rather than look at each individual product line, as we said in our prepared remarks, to look at where the company's going to end up overall, we look at the consolidated. And what we've consistently said is that we want to reach a 1.5% to 2% margin by 2017.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay. So I think you had guided to 90 at the Investor Day for this year, which you haven't updated, a 7.5% on the G&A ratio. So it's not a very high bar I guess with 1.5% to 2%. That's net right? I imagine (37:00), I think that's what it was...
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: That's right. The bar I think is – from the outside it may look easy. From the inside, with all the moving parts, it's a challenge.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: No, I didn't mean it that way (37:12)...
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: And our goal by 2017 is to lower that by 0.5% to 1.5%.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay. So right now I just I think what – all I'm trying to say is that it doesn't look like you would miss that, your normalized parts (37:27). If anything it feels like there might be some upside given that at least for the first quarter you've come in a little bit better, right. So hopefully that's...
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: Well, I think that as Mario and Terry talked about at the last Investor Day, we have a new Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Keith Wilson, who is re-energizing the medical management. And they've taken a very member-centric approach to things. And it seems that as we said, for the first quarter we can say it seems that some of the efforts are taking hold.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay. And then you had mentioned also at the I-Day that there's a federal regulation which will help you cross-subsidize. And some of my channel checks are saying that that's due any day. Any more color on that? And will that help you out?
J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: No?
J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We are – we're still waiting for those regulations. We thought they would be out. We have no further information. We're just going to have to wait. They'll come out when they come out.
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: And, Ana, to clarify, I don't think we said that the regulations would allow us to cross-subsidize. What we said was it was our opinion, our profession that these are all Medicaid patients. So it makes sense to include the Medicaid expansion lives and the TANF and the ABD in one set of risk mitigation calculations as opposed to three separate ones.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay. So, blended with Medicaid. Got it. All right. Thank you.
Operator: And we have a question from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Unknown Speaker: Sure. Thanks. This is Ace Fablo (39:12) in for Windley. I wanted to circle back to the G&A and just get a sense of that 8.1% starting point. Sure sounds like Puerto Rico once that comes on, that will help out with the leverage. But wanted to get a view of whether or not that was consistent with what you guys were thinking for the first quarter?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: It's Joe speaking. Yeah, when we line up everything on the G&A side it's first quarter, it was very consistent with what we expected for our guidance.
Unknown Speaker: Okay. And then besides Puerto Rico, are there other actions that are going to continue to help drive it lower? Or is it more of a function of business mix and scalability?
J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: It's scalability really. You know we've got a fair amount of revenue. And you can see by looking at our full-year guidance, we got a fair amount of revenue in addition to Puerto Rico still to come on this year. We've got the three MMP dual programs coming on in Michigan, Texas and South Carolina. If you look back to Investor Day, we also talked about some new programs in Texas that are going to add a lot to the top line. So I would say it's more scalability than anything, plus Puerto Rico.
Unknown Speaker: Okay. And then circling back to the HIF, I know you mentioned California. Can you – I think Michigan and Utah were the other hanging chads. What are the updates there with those states? And what's preventing them from locking up 2015 for you guys?
J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think it's just an issue of getting the appropriate documentation. We know that both Utah and Michigan have passed in their most recent budgets dollars to fund the payments but our policy is either we get a check or we get a contract amendment. And we haven't got the contract amendments in Utah or Michigan as of yet.
Unknown Speaker: Okay. And then just lastly on Florida, can you just give us an updated view on how things are trending there and what you're expecting in the full negotiation coming up here?
J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: On the MMA product I think that Molina like a lot of the other health plans are seeing higher medical care costs than we anticipated when the program was first bid and we are active discussions with ACA and legislature to increase the rates so that things turn out for the, as we expected.
Unknown Speaker: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question is from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Christopher J. Benassi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, there. This is Christopher Benassi on behalf of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Congrats on the quarter. I was wondering if you wouldn't mind walking us back through the HIF reimbursement timeline, I believe you mentioned it would have a $0.29 improvement to EPS. And then following up on that do you see any potential for this HIF timeline to be reduced going forward?
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: Sure. So, on the HIF we did not recognize any HIF revenue associated with the first quarter of 2015 for California, Michigan or Utah. That amount was $16 million or $0.20. The balance, the other $0.09, had to do with the non-recognition of the quality revenue in Texas. Getting back to the HIF we also have $20 million still hanging from 2014 which we did not recognize in the first quarter. We did get a check from the state of California after the quarter was over so we'll recognize that amount in the second quarter and that relates to 2014 unless we get a contract amendment or something from the state of California we will not recognize any of the HIF for 2015.
Christopher J. Benassi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you. And just following up on that quickly; MCR looked strong in the quarter. However, with all the market commentary regarding utilization I was just curious if you've seen any upticks geographically or within certain subpopulations? Thank you.
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: We didn't see anything unusual in the first quarter.
Christopher J. Benassi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you very much.
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: Thanks.
Operator: And we have a question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.
Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Sure. A question around the costs, in particular hep C costs for the quarter. How much of that have you gotten arranged to be passed through to your states at this point versus how much you don't have pass through or don't have agreements on? And then looking at your cost breakdown I can see that pharmacy and capitation costs as a percent of your overall costs is declining. Is that mix related or is there anything in terms of pricing on the fee for service side that's causing that to go down?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: It's Joe speaking. I don't have anything specific on hep C, I will say though in most of our states that issue has either been addressed either through some kind of risk pool, some kind of specific state reimbursement or an attempt to reimburse it in our rates. So I don't think hep C had a – treatments had a material impact on the first quarter. I think it's a matter now of just refining how states reimburse that's rather than trying to get over the concept of reimbursement. The second point is why is pharmacy would be dropping as a percentage of total medical spend is really driven by just the long-term services and support spend that we incur. One of the things as we shift to – we talked about shifting to more chronically ill patients or members who need home health assistance. Obviously for someone in some sort of home and community based services setting or in nursing facilities the drug cost is going to be – while large in absolute terms is a smaller percentage of their total spend.
Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: And is that with...
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: That's the issue (45:23) in a nutshell.
Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And is it true with the capitation component as well?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Yeah. It's the same story. Nothing dramatically has changed our capitation structure again it's just a lot of the costs with the LTSS are direct rather than capitated.
Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question is from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed.
Chris D. Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Thanks. Hey, guys. I know this is a small number in the Texas quality revenue but the amount you didn't recognize increased by $1 million year-to-year, I just want to make sure there's nothing to read into that, i.e. you have even lower visibility now than you did last year or something is tracking for the worse on the quality side?
Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer: Well that's a really – that's an astute question. The numbers are very small but curiously enough the percentage of quality revenue that's tied to those measures that we don't have visibility into went from about 50% last year to 60% this year. So I think that's what you're seeing.
Chris D. Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. And then the cost of service ratio declined quite a bit year-to-year and came in below where we are. Can you give us some color on what happened there? And just any – I know you give annual guidance. But sort of quarterly this has been a tough one to predict. Sort of any way to help us think about that would be helpful. Thank you.
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: The cost of service revenue associated with MMS? You know, Chris, nothing leaps to mind. Maybe we can dig into those numbers a little bit more to see what gets ferreted out.
Chris D. Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. And then I guess the cash flow too was pretty strong. Was there anything there notable? Thanks. And I'll leave it at that.
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: No. I mean we've been having very strong cash flow. DCP is up. We still – and a couple of the health plans are accruing money that we have to return to the states. So that is helping cash flow a bit.
Chris D. Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. Thanks a lot.
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: And that was our final question. And I'll now turn the call back to Dr. Molina.
J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us. It was a very strong quarter. And we're looking forward to talking to you next quarter on our next earnings release.

I have just a few comments today, but I’ll turn the call over to John who will delve into our financials in greater detail. I’m pleased to report that 2014 was a year of continued success in delivering on our strategic objectives. When compared with 2013, our revenue grew by almost 50%, our enrollment increased 36%. We expanded our geographic footprint to new markets in South Carolina and Florida. And we achieved greater economies of scale as evidenced by the consistent decline in our administrative cost ratio throughout the year. Two years ago, at our Winner Investor Day, we shared with investors our plan to nearly double the size of the company by the end of 2015. Our milestones, for the quarter and the year confirmed that we have made considerable progress towards that end but more importantly that our goal is now clearly within our reach. Last month I had the opportunity to meet with many of our investors at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, to talk about the company and our strategy. As I shared in my presentation, the revenue and enrollment momentum that we generated throughout 2014 has carried forward into the first quarter of 2015. In January alone, our enrollment grew by nearly 200,000 members led by new marketplace and Medicaid expansion lives. While the actual enrollment gains in our dual-eligible plans have been overshadowed by the gains in our marketplace and Medicaid expansion plans. Let me remind everyone that the revenue impact of one dual-eligible member is comparable to adding almost five Medicaid expansion members or 10 traditional TANF members. The continued addition of members with dual and long-term services and supports benefits shifts our focus towards more chronic, home-health and long-term care services for these members, and away from nor episodic and acute medical conditions we have seen in our TANF members. Several years ago, I introduced a chart that nicely illustrated the market segmentation of our business in the form of a pyramid. Today I want to remind all of you that this chart is still applicable as much today as when it was first presented. While our mothers and children continue to form the foundation of our membership base, we have continued to move towards a more complex care by adding more elderly and disabled members that now include the duals and long-term care beneficiaries. The implementation of our duals and standalone long-term care contracts will allow us to continue to evolve our model of care for members with chronic medical conditions. While at the same time, refining our operational processes for the duals contracts in Michigan and Texas. As in aside, our duals contract in South Carolina became operational this month with voluntary enrollment. As I discussed last month during the conference, we continue to expect 2015 to look a lot like 2014. In 2014, we experienced rapid membership and revenue growth requiring the assimilation of new members across all lines of business. And we expect much or the same this year. While this growth may come with the usual set of growing pains, as we have seen in 2014, it adds tremendous opportunity for us to greatly expand our business. Harnessing this unprecedented growth is a key area of focus for us in the near future. We’re very excited about the growth that we have seen this past year and with our successes in lowering the percentage of revenue spent on administrative cost. Staying true to the mission of our company and their values has allowed us to navigate through this exciting time. And we are looking forward to 2015 and to what the future holds for the company. I would now like to turn the call over to John.
John Molina: Thank you, Mario and hello everyone. Although we did not meet our earnings expectations in 2014, we, did good on many of our commitments to revenue growth and a greater administrative efficiency. When we see you in New York on Thursday, we will talk more about how our work in 2014 has set the stage for continued growth and improved profitability in the future. Right now though, I want to focus on 2014. Today we reported full year earnings at $1.30 per diluted share on a GAAP basis, or $3.43 per diluted share on an adjusted basis. This represents an improvement of more than 35% on a GAAP basis from our earnings of $0.96 per diluted share reported for 2013. We reported $3.13 per diluted share on an adjusted basis for the full year of 2013. Total revenues for the year grew by almost 50% compared with 2013, reaching a record of almost $10 billion. Putting this in perspective, we had more revenue in the first three quarters of 2014 than we had during all of 2013. Five of our health plans now generate over $1 billion in premiums. And two health plans California and New Mexico doubled their revenue in 2014 alone. This revenue growth was driven primarily by two key factors, significant increases in enrollment and higher premium revenue for many of our members. The higher premiums per member resulted from our continued transition from a company operating an acute care business to un-serving members with complex care needs that include behavioral healthcare and long-term services and supports. Members with more complex-needs bring with them a higher per-member per-month premium. 2014 enrollment grew to 2.6 million members, an increase of almost 700,000 members over year-end 2013. Membership growth was strong across all lines of business but was driven by Medicaid expansion and the membership added in South Carolina, Illinois and our Acquisition of First Coast Advantage in Florida. Per-member per-month premium grew by nearly 20% over the prior year, and was primarily a result of new Long-Term Services and Supports or LTSS benefits, now included in our managed care programs in California, Florida, Illinois, New Mexico and Ohio. As we promised back in February of 2014, we were able to deliver significant improvements in administrative efficiency throughout the year. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue declined to 7.3% for the fourth quarter of 2014, from 11% for the same period in 2013. For the full year ending December 31, 2014, we experienced an administrative expense ratio was 7.9% versus 10.1% in the same period for 2013. To remind you, the 10-basis point drop in our administrative expense ratio equates to an expense reduction of approximately $10 million or about $0.12 per diluted share directly to the bottom line. As we discussed last year, we devoted significant resources to infrastructure and human capital investments that were necessary to fuel our anticipated growth. As our new growth business came online during the year, we were able to finally realize the benefits of those investments. Our greatest financial challenge in 2014 was reflected in the increase in our medical care ratio over 2013. While we were pleased that our medical care ratio actually dropped slightly in the fourth quarter of 2014 when compared to the third quarter of 2014, our medical care ratio for the full year of 2014 was, 240 basis points higher than in 2013. We attribute the year-over-year increase in MCR to four factors. First, a significant amount of our revenue is now coming in from programs that cover long-term services and supports. As we’ve discussed in the past, the percentage profit margins for members receiving LTSS benefits are generally lower than those associated with our traditional membership, but the dollar margins are significantly higher. Second, increases to our base premiums in recent years have not kept pace with medical cost trends, as states it had to balance the need for rate increases with an increasing number of individuals who are eligible for government programs. Third, a lack of coordination in the design of profit caps and medical cost floors and some of our contracts have resulted in counter-productive outcomes. And the fourth factor is the inevitable time-lag between the initiation of care coordination and the care management efforts for our members with complex-needs and the realization of financial benefits from those efforts to reduce margins in 2014. In San Francisco last month, we talked about how we continue to be affected by delays and reimbursement for the health insurer fee in a few remaining states. We’ve also previously discussed that during the fourth quarter, the New Mexico and Texas Medicaid agencies agree to full reimbursement resulting in the recognition of $30 million in the fourth quarter. We have summarized the still unrecognized health insurer fee revenue for 2014 in the earnings release. The net amount outstanding from the California, Michigan and Utah Medicaid agencies is approximately $20 million. In other words, had we been able to recognize this revenue in 2014, our EPS would have been higher by $0.26. Finally, I want to highlight our cash position as of December 31, 2014. The company had cash in investments of around $2.6 billion including approximately $200 million at the parent level. Most importantly cash flow from operations increased significantly to over $1 billion for the year ending December 31, 2014. We will be hosting our Investor Day Conference in New York City this Thursday, February 12 at 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time. At that presentation we will be discussing the company’s outlook and strategy for 2015. We look forward to seeing you there or encourage that you listen the other webcast. Since we will be discussing 2015 outlook in New York on Thursday, as Juan José said, we will not be taking calls or questions on this subject matter today. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush Securities. You may proceed with your question.
Sarah James: Thank you. I was hoping that you could break out some of the out-of-period items in the quarter. It looked like there was about $0.21 of health insurer fee that was the out-of-period benefit and the $0.10 Texas bonus headwind. But I wasn’t sure if there was unusual flu activity. SG&A came in about 20 basis points better than guidance. I wasn’t sure if that’s just out-of-period revenue or if there is some sustainable improvement there? And then, last, if there was anything going on in Florida related FCA Acquisition like a reserve belt? Thank you.
Joe White: Hi Sarah, it’s Joe speaking. As with any quarter we have and I could discuss with you four hours, a whole pile of one-time out-of-period adjustments favorable and unfavorable. I think really other than the pick-up from the ACA health insurer fee in Texas and New Mexico, I would say that the pluses and minuses kind of evened out this quarter. Texas quality revenue continues to remain a headwind. And I think we spoke about that. There is about $19 million or $20 million of that potentially still left on the table that we might be able to realize in 2015, if we get information from the state. And that information indicates we’ve earned the quality revenue. Again, there is a lot of step back and forth, New Mexico for example is a state. It’s a state with considerable activity this quarter and this year in terms of retroactive enrollment, adjustments to reserves. I’d say the same thing about Florida in the second half of the year as a result of revenue increases that are going to come in retro to September 1, 2014 that we were able to recognize. So, you’ve seen some out-of-period stuff reflected in those states. And I think it’s meaningful. But in general, I think you can just look at it in terms of the health insurer fees being the one item.
John Molina: Yes, Sarah, this is John. This is why we always caution everyone against trying to take a quarter and extrapolate future run rates. That’s why we rather look at a longer period of time, one or two years as opposed to one or two quarters.
Sarah James: Got it. Thank you guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carter with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question.
Chris Carter: Thanks, good afternoon. Just wondering if you could give us an update on New Mexico, I know the LTSS members are running access of 100% MLR there last quarter, just curious how that book is tracking this quarter.
Joe White: It’s Joe speaking again, Chris. I don’t think we’ve seen anything drastically changed about New Mexico. Obviously we’ll talk about that more on Thursday at Investor Day. I would say though that despite what the recorded numbers are showing you, I don’t think there has been deterioration in New Mexico or Florida this quarter. And there is like just a huge amount of retroactivity with membership and other issues in New Mexico. So, I think what we said last quarter it pretty much stands.
Chris Carter: Got it. And then, just maybe some more commentary on Washington, did you guys get a rate increase there or anything on the ABD book?
Mario Molina: Chris, we’re going to be talking about all the 2015 rates on Thursday.
Chris Carter: Okay, all right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. You may proceed with your question.
Josh Raskin: Hi, thanks. First question, just on Texas, I think in the press release you talked about the $25.5 million that wasn’t recorded and you said $20 million was lack of information I guess to substantiate the payment. So, what’s the other $5.5 million?
Joe White: Josh, its Joe again. The other $5.5 million is essentially revenue we don’t think we’re going to be able to recognize related to 2014.
Josh Raskin: Okay. So you have visibility on that but you just don’t think you hit the matrix or whatever they changed often, and that’s sort of, so that’s normally there?
Joe White: Correct.
Josh Raskin: And then, what about timing for the ACA reimbursement from California, have they given you a timeline as to when they will reviewing this and do they have any rationale for why they are one of the only states that doesn’t believe that this should part of rates?
John Molina: Josh, we’re going to talk more about that on Thursday. But California is making progress albeit slow. So there is a light at the end of the tunnel and there is another train coming our way.
Josh Raskin: Okay. It’s not something where you feel like you need to start taking legal action or anything like that?
Mario Molina: No. This is Mario. My understanding is that they have submitted something to CMS and they’re waiting approval.
Josh Raskin: Okay, got you. And then, just last question, I know we don’t want to talk about a specific quarter and extrapolating and I know you’re not going to give guidance for ’15, but that’s our job. So, I have to ask. The 2014 number, as you guys think about it, how would you break-out the one-time items? Obviously we know the ACAP and we know the tax performance fees. And I guess we can determine whether or not we think taxes, is run rate or not. But I know Joe just mentioned some retroactivity in the quarter. So, I’m just trying to figure about if you think about what is like the run rate, so getting about 2015 but where do we start in 2014 as sort of a baseline of what you think you’ve earned on a run rate basis?
Joe White: It’s Joe speaking. I think it’s, I mean, all-in Josh, I would kind of look to, I would kind of look to what we reported for the full year. That’s all-in, that I think says what our year is pretty well once you smooth everything out I wouldn’t look to a quarter. But I think the full year rate of 89.5% is, that’s our run rate for 2014.
Mario Molina: So, this is Mario, I just want to kind of reemphasize what Joe said. This has been a lumpy year because of a lot of timing issues, things like the ACAPs and so forth. New programs coming in, some rate adjustments here and there, retroactive membership, it’s been added to the plan. So, it’s very difficult to do much with the quarter but I think that to Joe’s point, look at the year-end results. And that gives you a pretty fair picture, smooth out of what the year look like.
Josh Raskin: Yes, and I was looking more at the EPS number. So, I was thinking about like $1.30 and then Texas, is $0.33 and the un-reimbursed health insurance fee is $0.26. So, after adjusting for those, do you think that that’s relatively reflective of what you think Molina’s underlying earnings are?
Joe White: I would say Josh that’s reflective of what 2014 underlying earnings are. We’re going to speak more to 2015 on Thursday.
Mario Molina: Yes, I mean, clearly there are some things like the ACAP reimbursement that hurt us this year that was really outside of our control. If you look at the medical care ratio, it’s about what we thought I was going to come in at when we gave guidance last year.
Josh Raskin: Okay, all right. Perfect, thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question.
Mike Meesha: Good evening, this is Mike Meesha in for Justin. Did the fourth quarter include any one-time transaction costs from the First Coast Advantage Acquisition? And also can you break down sharing the transaction details or expected accretion from the deal?
Joe White: It’s Joe speaking. As far as transaction cost, they were pretty minimal.
Mike Meesha: And how about any transaction details or accretion?
Mario Molina: We brought over 63,000 members in the Jacksonville area, it was an asset purchase in terms of the revenue accretion and it’s probably it’s not material at this point.
Mike Meesha: Okay. And does the deal have any sort of skewing effect on the elevated MLR in for the quarter or was that really not much of the factor?
Joe White: It’s Joe speaking. If you look at the Florida standalone results for the quarter, yes. Because when we do, when acquisition of that especially in December, the way we book reserves it’s going to be a factor and pushing up the fourth quarter Florida MLR but not consolidated.
Mike Meesha: And do you have a sense of where the Florida MLR would have been current x the transaction?
Joe White: I can’t speak to that but I would just say that given everything that’s happened in Florida this quarter back in New York in September, I said Florida was probably going to run in the low 90s, and I’m standing by that prediction.
Mike Meesha: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question.
Kevin Fischbeck: Okay, great. Thanks. I guess, just going back to the Texas if for a second, I guess you didn’t book $5.5 million. How do we think about that number, is that a number where you say well, the number was $32 million annually. Then you always only collect 90% of it or 80% of it or is that a number that you think you should be consistently getting 100% over what that has been historically?
John Molina: This is John. It changes every year because the State of Texas changes, the T for P metrics. So, this year, on the metrics that we got visibility on, we think that we’re not going to achieve 100% compliance. So we think that’s going to result in $5 million get-back. In 2015 it may be different depending on what the measures are on our performance.
Kevin Fischbeck: But I guess, do you have like a 2013 number?
John Molina: Yes, actually there was, I want to say in 2013, there was $4 million or $5 million we were unable to recognize too. So in that regard, it’s been consistent.
Kevin Fischbeck: Okay. And I guess, I appreciate the fact that from quarter-to-quarter a lot of moving pieces and you’ve grown so much that it’s difficult to kind of look at things on a quarterly basis. But I guess, just qualitatively as we think about the quarter, there are some books of business that you just brought online this quarter, some books of business that you had for a couple of quarters now. As you guys think about that normal progression of a company bringing out a lot of revenue, is there any book whether it’s duals or long-term care or whatever is performing not the way you would have thought in a good or bad, is there any clarity you can give around how you feel like qualitatively the progression is coming in? And then if you can kind of break it out between your Medicaid expansion versus core TANF versus duals versus long-term care, that would be helpful?
Mario Molina: Kevin that is a great question and we actually have a slide on that. We’ll be talking about that on Thursday.
Kevin Fischbeck: Okay, all right. I guess so I look for that. Perfect. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Wright with Sterne Agee. You may proceed with your question.
Brian Wright: Thanks. It seems like since there were some retro membership assigned in both Florida and New Mexico, did I hear that correctly?
Joe White: Brian much more in New Mexico, New Mexico has been having retro revenue - I’m sorry retro enrollment additions all year.
Brian Wright: And that’s completely separate from your negotiations with regard to the separate minimum MLR by products in New Mexico?
Joe White: As far as I know yes, I think it’s just a matter of the state. And everybody in New Mexico has been working hard to get members on so they can get care. And that rolled out during the year and some people were enrolled retro.
Brian Wright: I apologize, but did you give us the dollar amount of the negative impact for the byproduct MLRs in certain states like New Mexico?
Mario Molina: Say that again Brian.
Brian Wright: Wanted to just know, kind of how much the results were hurt in ’14 by kind of byproduct MLRs in states like New Mexico and sort of like a consolidated minimum MLR?
Mario Molina: Okay. Well, Brian let me speak to, yes, we have a line on our balance sheet for the amount payable back to the states about $527,000 is payable back to the states for various issues. About $390,000 or $400,000 of that relates to Washington, California and New Mexico combined.
John Molina: Let me clarify Brian, that was $570 million not $570,000.
Brian Wright: Okay, thank you. And then if I can just sneak one last one in here. Way back in ’05 you guys took a run at Georgia, just any updated thoughts?
Joe White: So, our understanding that the RFP was released today. And so anytime an RFP is released we evaluate whether we want to proceed.
Brian Wright: You have people in the state currently?
Mario Molina: What do you mean by people Brian? You mean, do we have staff there? No.
Brian Wright: Okay, all right. Thank you. That’s all I’ve got. Thanks.
Mario Molina: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. You may proceed with your question.
Chris Rigg: Okay. Well, thanks. I just wanted to come back to Florida quickly here on the MLR. I heard a comment about the acquisition but I guess, I believe you got a rate increase on the long-term care side. I could be wrong. But assuming you did, did things Joe still shape up as you, when you talked about the MLR last fall, did you assume the rate increase in the context of your comments?
Joe White: Yes, that’s correct Chris. And there was a rate increase in Florida, back in September ’01 just as a result of timing of communication of that and signing of the paperwork and everything. We weren’t able to recognize any of that increase in 2014. So that’s one reason of why the fourth quarter had such a high MLR. So, there is a definitive delay and revenue recognition in Florida that’s hurting the quarter.
Chris Rigg: Okay, all right. So then I guess, how much would, can you give us a sense for how much the rate increase would have impacted results?
Joe White: I don’t have that specifically Chris but I think if we have APU combine that with the impact of the way we book the acquisition, you definitely push down below 95%.
Chris Rigg: Okay. And then I guess…
John Molina: I think we’re going nothing below 90s there with all the said and done.
Chris Rigg: Okay. And then I guess, just on the flip side, California continues to track pretty well here. Any sense for how we should think about sort of, I know this is kind of a 2015 question but just sense about trends going forward, how the state is looking at the rates there? How you feel about rates in California generally? Thanks.
John Molina: I think California is a real good illustration that we can carry on to places like Florida and New Mexico and Washington. California recognized that it has under-priced specifically the ABD population. And over a period of about two to three years they raised that rate. And as we grew the business, grew profitably. So, again I think that over the next several years when we’re working with other states on the base rates because the lack of rate increases over a period of time can squeeze margins.
Mario Molina: This is Mario. I just want to put in the plug for medical management as well. I mean it’s not simply a passive issue about getting your rate increase. The management team in California did a good job as well of trying to improve the performance of the plan they deserve credit too.
John Molina: That’s the difference between the doctor and the lawyer in the line of business.
Chris Rigg: There you go. Thanks a lot.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. You may proceed with your question.
Ana Gupte: Yes, thanks. Good evening. The first question I had was on G&A outlook as you point out. It’s extremely sensitive and much of the bottom line. In terms of the fourth quarter and in business expansion costs and other things for ’15, was that in any way more front-loaded? So as you’re thinking about 2015, is there likely to be more improvement going forward?
Joe White: Ana, you said the word outlook. So, we’re going to get into all of the admin. Remember, we’re going to be bringing on in Puerto Rico and some other of the duals contracts in 2015. So, we’ll go through the whole admin discussion on Thursday.
Ana Gupte: Okay. Anything at all on whether or not you had ’15 cost, what was the magnitude of the ’15 cost in the fourth quarter?
Joe White: I’m sorry Ana, we didn’t hear that, any magnitude of what?
Ana Gupte: Anything you can comment on as far as just how much of the business expansion cost might have been booked upfront?
Joe White: I mean, I would say in general they weren’t substantial. When we were in New York, we expected G&A back in January, we said G&A would run about 7.5% on the fourth quarter it’s a hair below that. But year-to-date we’re right basically where we said we’d be. I wouldn’t, we continue to make good progress on the G&A front but I don’t think there is something, there is huge upside out there beyond what we’ve already talked to you about.
Ana Gupte: Okay, thanks. Thanks Joe. On flu and Hep-C, did you say anything about that if you did in your prepared remarks, I’m sorry, but what was the experience in the fourth quarter and as the flu season peaking?
Mario Molina: Sure. So, on the flu season, I think it’s been a moderate increase from last year so 2014 a little bit higher than 2013 but not a lot. And on Hepatitis C, as you know we have been able to reach accommodation with many of our states on some sort of reimbursement mechanism, so that’s mitigated a lot of the risk that we face on the Hepatitis C front. And the current Hepatitis C utilizations included in our numbers for the quarter.
Ana Gupte: Okay, thanks. One last one on, based on claims payables, is where you are right now something that you see as your normalized levels of where you need to be?
Joe White: It’s Joe speaking. I would think that over time that DCP number is going to come down. Right now obviously we still have a lot of business, it’s starting. Any claims that we’re associated with the Florida acquisition, very few of those were paid in December because we just started. So I think, I think over time you’ll see us work our inventories down which will in-turn reduce the days and claims payable as a byproduct of that. I don’t know when that’s going to happen because we got some growth in front of us next year. But I think in general, as we look out over a couple of years that number will come down.
Ana Gupte: Thanks so much, I appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel. You may proceed with your question.
Tom Carroll: Hi guys, good evening. So I want to come back a couple of things, I want to come back to Josh’s question on run rate and put a final point on it. Joe, you mentioned $1.30 was a good number, but if we add back the $0.26 for the ACA impact, $0.33 for the Texas quality impact, we get to $1.89. Is that a reasonable number to think about in terms of us now thinking about next year?
Mario Molina: Yes. My thoughts were more on the MCR level. I think we’ve laid it out Tom. I think if you add back in the health insurer fee and a good chunk of the Texas quality revenue that’s where you get. I would just caution everybody that we’re going to be talking again about 2015 on Thursday. So things can change in the course of the year.
Tom Carroll: So, that considering the $1.89 just for conversation purposes now, and looking out at the consensus numbers that are out there of around $2.51, it implies like 33% growth. And I would think a company like yours seeing all kinds of growth would be fairly comfortable with that number. Would you feel uncomfortable putting percentage?
Joe White: Tom, Tom, Tom, nice try. But that’s you’re asking us to confirm something that we’re going to talk about on Thursday.
Tom Carroll: All right. What are the things? So let’s go to the Texas quality payment again. There has been some dialogue around this now for a while so I apologize. But relative to the $20 million that you highlight that lacks information. Is that run-out data that you need from the state in order to evaluate the framework? And I guess what, is your gut feeling in terms of that coming into the company either in first quarter or second quarter of this year?
Mario Molina: So, Tom, this is Mario. This is a very complex calculation. And it depends not only on our performance but our performance relative to our peers. So even if we know how we’re doing on some of these measures, it’s very difficult for us to be able to recognize the revenue because we don’t know where we stand in relation to everyone else. That’s one of the problems with these new measures that Texas has come up with. If you look at some of the measures we had from 2013, we did not settle that until December of 2014. So, it could take a while before we get clarity on the Texas performance measure that’s still outstanding.
Tom Carroll: Right, I appreciate that. But you must have, you have some comfort around the $5 million right, in not being able to capture that?
Mario Molina: The $5 million is really more related to HETA [ph] scores which are pretty easy to calculate.
Tom Carroll: Okay. So, I guess what’s your comfort level around the $20 million is that, it sounds like there is some risk there still to it. Is it do you feel like you’re going to get 80% of it?
Mario Molina: I think it’s difficult for us to say at this point.
Tom Carroll: Okay.
Mario Molina: I think potentially we’re going to pick up some of it, but I can’t tell you how much.
Joe White: If we had insight into that we’d record the revenue or tell you can, we would have recorded the revenue. So right now, we just know enough.
Tom Carroll: And then, one last one, the tax rate in the quarter seemed a little lower than was implied through the guidance discussions we had all through 2014. Is that the case you think and if it was why do you have a lower number?
Mario Molina: We’re just going to be talking about tax rates in New York on Thursday but not to steal this thunder. But in general, remember with a large non-deductible, expenses we have, to the extent pre-tax income increases, you’re going to have a decrease in your effective tax rate which is what happened this quarter.
Tom Carroll: Okay, all right, thank you.
Mario Molina: So, you are correct. It would be a little lower than some, it would be lower than some people might have expected.
Tom Carroll: All right, good deal. Thanks. Thursday.
Mario Molina: Thursday.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed with your question.
Peter Costa: Thanks. And looking at your Texas quality payments for the quarter, they actually went down from the third quarter. You’re expecting to see more coming in from next year. Can you explain to us why they went down from one quarter to the next?
Joe White: It’s Joe speaking. First of all we’re not saying anything about what we expect to receive or not receive what we expect to earn next quarter. All we’re saying is that of the $25 million of Texas quality revenue related to 2014, $20 million of that was not recognized because we do not yet have the appropriate metrics from the state to assess our compliance. As far as the actual number, the amount recognized in fourth quarter dropping, that’s because we realized that $5 million was not going to be recognized as a result of some hiatus measures we didn’t hit. So, again I just want to emphasize, we don’t have visibility right now right now into how that $20 million is going to play out in terms of whether we’d be able to recognize it or not. Right now it’s unrecognized. And we’ll recognize it if we indeed earn the revenue.
Peter Costa: So the revenues would have been higher if you hadn’t made the decision that $5.5 million wouldn’t be recognized, is that a fair statement?
Joe White: That’s correct, that’s correct.
Peter Costa: Okay. And then, can you talk about Hep-C a little bit more in detail. How many states have carved out specifically vacillating you from utilization of Hepatitis C drugs, so not necessarily included into your rates but created some kind of a car value, there are kick payment or something like that?
Joe White: Off the top of my head, I can’t tell you that. But I know that most of our States’ grafts almost all of them have done something to mitigate the Hepatitis C and starting a variety of different mechanisms. So it’s kind of, it’s very complicated. But we do have a fair amount of protection on mitigation, not entirely. And clearly we don’t have that for the Medicare business on the Part B side. But there are other issues with Medicare Part B. So, I’m feeling pretty good about it now, much better than I did this time last year when we thought this was potentially a budget buster for us, having said that, it’s still a big issue for the states. And whether they are reimbursing us or paying for fee-for-service, this is something that’s going to put a drag on state Medicaid budgets in the future.
Peter Costa: Okay. And then, in your prepared comments, you said 2015 would be a lot like 2014 but then you said it was a year where they’re setting you up for growth and improve profitability in the future. Did you imply improved profitability in 2015? And if you did, off of what level, off the run-rate you guys were talking about or off of the reported numbers?
Joe White: So again, when we get into guidance on Thursday, what you’re going to see is that 2014 and 2015 are going to be very similar. And this is another year of growth for us, picked up a lot of members in January and February through the marketplace. And we continue to see growth in Medicaid. We have the Puerto Rico contract coming in. And we have some duals contracts that are rolling in so, again, another year of a lot of growth in revenue and membership.
Peter Costa: All right, I understand that. But just regarding the improved profitability in the future, what future are we referring to, after 2015 or 2015?
Mario Molina: That’s 2015, right.
Peter Costa: Okay, got it. Thanks much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Windley with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question.
David Windley: Hi, good evening, thank you. You’ve addressed for several of the other higher MLR states in your report tonight, overlapped with the state that you mentioned about LTSS and then in case of Washington ABD, do you feel like you have the appropriate programs and resources deployed in states to be able to continue to attack and work down medical cost and MLR? Or are there still investments that need to be made in those states to get there? I suppose the flip side of that question would be, how much of it is rate and how much of it is your execution?
Terry Bayer: This is Terry Bayer, I’ll respond to that. First keep in mind that this is the first time that the full long-term services and supports benefit both from a community base and long-term care facility is coming into managed care. And like any new program, it takes time to really develop and execute on the program. No different, there is a unit cost element but more importantly we’re focused on the coordination programs. One of the benefits of the duals and the Medicaid and Medicare dollars coming together is that by managing the long-term services and supports, we expect to see benefit back on the Medicare side. Remember that the LTSS is a Medicaid benefit. So, this will not be in place on day one, it takes time to build relationships with the facilities, to get everybody assessed, to get the care plans in place and get it executed before [ph]. But we are really looking at the whole set of services, both the Medicaid and Medicare side.
Mario Molina: So, let me just also add to what Terry said, this is Mario. We have been doing Medicare D-SNPs now for nine years. We have experienced with many of these benefits in places like California, Texas and Florida. So, I think we’re very well positioned to deal with these issues going forward. And I think that we do have the appropriate staff and experience. I think our experience with the D-SNPs has been invaluable and will really help us as we try to combine the Medicaid long-term services with the Medicare program of these combined contracts. So I think I’m pretty confident that we can do this and I think that we’re really well positioned for it.
David Windley: Thank you. So, follow-on question there, what are you seeing in terms of Medicare opt-out in the duals, is that leveled off, I mean what messaging actions are you taking around that?
Mario Molina: Well, we told everyone at the beginning of the year that we thought it was going to run about 50%. And it’s been doing that, of course it varies a little bit from one geographic region to another. It depends on things like networks. Remember if you’ve got a dual eligible beneficiary who is seeing five or six specialists, all you need is the one specialist to say I’m not in the network, don’t stay in that health plan. So, that’s I think part of what contributes to this, part of its network. The other thing is frankly, the way these things are rolled out, there is a lot of confusion for the beneficiaries. And some of these people dis-enroll before they even find out what the program is all about. I think that to the extent that we have a longer voluntary enrollment period and more of an ability to explain to the members the benefits of the program, as we’ve done with the D-SNPs in the past, people will sign-up, I think they will see it’s beneficial to them. But it’s going to take a while and I think some of the people that are opting out now may come around and rejoin us in the future because we will still be responsible for their long-term care services.
David Windley: Thank you for the answers.
Operator: The final question is a follow-up question from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Rigg: Great, thanks for letting me hop back on here. I just wanted to come back Mario, I could have misheard you. But did you say that you just recognized some quality moneys in Texas from 2013 in the fourth quarter of ’14?
Joe White: It’s Joe speaking that’s correct. The amounts were fairly small. But I think there was $300,000 or $400,000 it just got cleaned up in late 2014 related to 2013. I think Mario’s point was there is an extraordinary. There can be an extraordinary tail on the determination of these metrics. They’re extraordinarily complex in their calculation and require time for them to develop. So while it’s not, that specific item wasn’t financially significant. It does indicate again the tail we have on some of this revenue which really far sees what we even have on claims liability.
Chris Rigg: All right, great. I just wanted to make sure that it wasn’t something material in the quarter.
Joe White: Yes.
Chris Rigg: Thanks a lot.
Joe White: Yes.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference back to you.
Mario Molina: So, it probably doesn’t need to be said but we’re looking forward to seeing you all on Thursday where we’re going to provide guidance and talk about our strategy and outlook for 2015. See you then.

Joseph Mario Molina: Thank you, Juan José, and hello, everyone. Our performance this quarter is consistent with what we discussed at our Investor Day in September. We continue to operate in a very dynamic environment, one that has brought us a tremendous amount of growth in a short period of time. Our premium revenue, which has been fueled by unprecedented enrollment gains, now stands at $6.4 billion on a year-to-date basis and $200 million more than we booked in all of 2013. To put our growth in perspective, it took our company approximately 23 years to grow to 500,000 members. This year, we added nearly 500,000 members in the first 3 quarters alone. But that's not all, we now expect to add an additional 500,000 members in the next 9 months. This makes for an exciting time for our company. A time filled with exceptional growth opportunities that are already contributing to a dramatic expansion. 2/3 of our new enrollment this year has come from Medicaid expansion lives led by California, Ohio and Washington. The remaining 1/3 has come from initiatives that are even more significant to our long-term growth. The expansion of our geographic footprint and the addition of new programs for the chronically ill. We expanded our footprint, adding South Carolina and Illinois. Our Florida health plan began rolling out the new Managed Medicaid Assistance or MMA program in August. The Florida health plan was involved in 2 acquisitions: one in Palm Beach; and one in the Jacksonville service area. The Jacksonville transition is now approved for transition of members starting on December 1, 2014, and we anticipate that approximately 65,000 members will be transitioned to become Molina members. In terms of programs for the elderly and disabled, many of whom are chronically ill, we have also implemented dual eligible contracts in California, Illinois and Ohio, as well as new long-term care contracts in Florida and New Mexico. Last, we began selling marketplace products in 9 of our states, and we've learned a great deal from this experience over the past year. Collectively, the coordination of all these new programs combined with Medicaid expansion represents the largest and fastest integration in the history of our company. With this growth environment as a backdrop, it is not surprising that our top line revenue growth has been excellent. Administrative costs are also tracking just as we expected. We continue to reap the benefit of the investments in infrastructure that we made last year. As a matter of fact, our year-to-date admin ratio of 8.2% is 160 basis points lower than last year, and our third quarter admin rate of 7.2% is the lowest in 5 years. This has contributed to the doubling of pretax income when you compare the third quarter of 2014 to the third quarter of 2013. We are positioned to continue capitalizing on this growth, and we are fully aware that short-term issues are the price we pay for long-term success. So let's talk about some of the factors that are having a greater impact on our short-term profitability. They include the delays in revenue recognition, the programmatic challenges of integrating a new managed care business and a difficult rate environment across many of our states. I will now expand on each of these factors. First, the delay in revenue recognition has affected our financial results throughout the year. Specifically, the delay in recognition of the health insurer fee and the quality incentive revenue under our contract with the State of Texas have yet to be fully resolved. With respect to the health insurer fee, as of today, the company has a formal commitment for the reimbursement of about 60% of the 2014 fee, including tax effects. Most of the shortfall relates to our California, New Mexico and Texas health plans. Unreimbursed health insurer fees from California, New Mexico and Texas plus unreimbursed tax effects of the fee from Michigan and Utah amounts to $50 million in total for all of 2014. To date, we have paid $89 million related to the health insurer fee to the Internal Revenue Service, with $81 million related to Medicaid and $8 million related to Medicare. Even though we received informal acknowledgments from California, New Mexico and Texas, that they are responsible for reimbursing the fee. So far, they have not made formal commitments. We continue to believe that this represents a timing issue and that all of our states will ultimately fund the fee. However, we are less certain that they will formally commit to doing so before the year-end. Finally, to secure formal commitments to reimburse the fee -- I'm sorry, failure to secure formal commitments to reimburse the fee will delay revenue recognition, and we can expect that some states will not provide such formal commitments until next year. Let me remind you, as we talked about at our Investor Day, our 2014 guidance assumed that we would be able to book 100% of the fee during the current year. So the inability to recognize any portion of the $50 million in reimbursement, not yet secured, will represent a shortfall from our guidance. Our other major barrier to revenue recognition is related to quality incentives in Texas. You will recall that we have about $35 million of potential quality revenue in Texas for the full year and that our 2014 guidance includes full recognition of this amount. We have yet to receive clear direction from the state as to how some of these quality measures will be calculated. So far this year, we have recorded only $8 million of that revenue. To the extent that we do not receive clear guidance by year-end, we will not record the full amount of Texas quality revenue. As with the health insurer fee, the outcome of this matter will have a direct effect on our performance versus guidance in 2014. The second factor impeding profitability in 2014 has to do with implementing new managed care programs and the challenges involved in caring for those with chronic health conditions that result in higher medical costs. Currently, our medical costs are trending slightly higher than we anticipated, and we expect this trend to continue as we bring on additional enrollment in the near future. You may recall the large-scale migrations from fee-for-service to managed care that we implemented for the TANF and ABD populations in Ohio, for ABD in California or in managed care expansion for STAR+ programs in Texas in 2012. These implementations resulted in short-term margin compression due to medical cost volatility. Over time, and with the help of medical management initiatives, these programs stabilized and began contributing to earnings as the medical care ratio declined. The implementation of a new managed care program is further complicated by the complex needs of our new members. The care model for chronically ill requires skill, patience and persistence. Frequently, it requires educating both members and physicians about the most appropriate ways to access healthcare services. It requires hard work in assessing the health condition of new members, developing care plans for patients with complex conditions, ensuring that their home environments are supportive of good health and constant follow-up to coordinate care among medical, behavioral health and personal care; providers. In many cases, it is difficult to even locate and establish contact with our new members. Many of you will recall that Terry spoke at length to these issues when we were in New York City last month. Among her lessons learned was that the chronically ill require more intensive management than even we anticipated. We have spoken many times over the past year about the growth in the number of members receiving long-term services and supports or LTSS. We have also discussed how on a percentage basis profit margins on LTSS are generally lower than those on the acute medical benefits, providing us with very little wiggle room. Despite these challenges, we remain confident in our ability to improve medical margins over time. First, as members become acclimated to managed care and enrollment decelerates, we would expect medical cost come down. Second, we have proven in the past that our medical management and care coordination efforts are successful in reducing medical cost over time. A third factor is per-member per-month premium revenue. Premium rate increases have not kept up with medical inflation. We have had success in addressing inadequate premium rates before. One need only look to the experience of our California health plan to see the dramatic effect that even modest rate increases can have on our financial performance. We remain optimistic that the revenue recognition issues associated with the health insurer fee and the spike in medical cost will improve over time. The adequacy of premium rates is an ongoing challenge in our industry. We will continue to support actuarial soundness, but we need more transparency into the states' rate setting process. We continue to seek new market opportunities that are consistent with our mission and strategy. This month, Molina was selected by the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration to operate the Commonwealth's Medicaid-funded government health program in the East and Southwest regions. We are pleased to have been selected, and we look forward to working closely with local providers in order to satisfy readiness requirements. Under the government health program, the new model of care in Puerto Rico will integrate medical and behavioral healthcare services under a single managed care organization in each region. Molina Healthcare's total expected enrollment opportunity in the 2 regions is about 350,000 members, with expected annualized revenues of approximately $750 million. The program currently covers 1.4 million beneficiaries across Puerto Rico and is expected to begin in April 2015. Along with continuing to pursue opportunities for the future, we continue to focus on providing high-quality, cost-effective care for our members. For our company, quality is a strategic priority. We therefore consider it a great achievement that, for 10 consecutive years, our health plans have been nationally ranked by NCQA for providing quality care. This year, 9 of our health plans were ranked by NCQA among the best Medicaid health plans in the United States. Our Medicaid plans in New Mexico, Utah and Washington are the highest-ranked plans in their respective states. Providing our members with access to quality care, continues to be our top priority today, just as it has been for the last 34 years. The third quarter 2014, much like the first and second quarters, faced many of the headwinds we have been talking about all year. Nevertheless, we have more than doubled our pretax income when compared to the third quarter of last year. We have not reached all of our goals and we will not reach them over night, but we are certainly making progress. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John.
John C. Molina: Thank you, Mario, and hello, everyone. Diluted net income per share doubled to $0.33 during the third quarter of 2014 compared to $0.16 per diluted share during the third quarter of 2013. Adjusted net income and adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased to $0.83 per diluted share this quarter compared to $0.71 during the same quarter a year ago. During the third quarter, we maintained the strong enrollment and revenue growth we saw in the first half of the year and improved our administrative cost performance markedly. In summary, premiums and administrative costs are tracking consistently with our expectations. Our medical care ratio is tracking slightly above our expectations, which is creating some pressure on our bottom line. First, I'll talk about revenue. Total revenue this quarter reached $2.5 billion, fueled by increases in both membership and per-member per-month premium. During the third quarter, enrollment grew across all of our products. Let me provide you with some enrollment highlights. Medicaid expansion enrollment was strong and grew over 80,000 members this quarter to 315,000, a 35% increase. Not only does our current Medicaid expansion enrollment significantly exceed the enrollment guidance we provided, but the number of expansion members we have added so for this year exceeds the total membership we added in 2012 and 2013 combined. And we are encouraged by recent studies published by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Modern Healthcare, that suggests we may continue to see more Medicaid expansion enrollment growth in 2015. In addition, other states continue to review expanding their Medicaid programs. For example, last week, the State of Utah announced that it has come to terms with CMS on a Medicaid Expansion program. Enrollment also grew dramatically in Florida and Illinois. The Florida health plan added 40,000 members during their third quarter. In addition, once the Jacksonville transaction closes in December, we anticipate that approximately 65,000 members will transfer to Molina. In Illinois, we began participating in the managed care program for TANF and expression patients in August, and our enrollment in that state grew by 15,000 members in the third quarter. Illinois TANF and expansion enrollment is still growing, and we anticipate our membership will increase by 60,000 members in the fourth quarter. I want to take a moment to highlight that combined 125,000 members, that we are expecting from Florida and Illinois during the fourth quarter, is the equivalent of adding another entire state. As a point of comparison, our health plan in South Carolina currently has 118,000 members. We launched Medicare Medicaid Plans or MMPs in California, Illinois and Ohio. At September 30, we served over 14,000 MMP members. These are members for whom we provide both Medicare and Medicaid benefits. At September 30, we also served over 20,000 MMP-eligible members in California and Ohio for whom we provide only Medicaid benefits. Over 80% of MMP-eligible members, for whom we provide only Medicaid benefits, are in Ohio. MMP-eligible members in Ohio are not yet assigned by default to a managed care provider for Medicare coverage. Only those who actively choose or opt-in to receive an integrated offering are enrolled as fully integrated MMP members. Passive enrollment of members into an integrated program is not slated to begin in Ohio until 2015. Setting aside the technicalities of enrollment, fully integrated MMP members have contributed almost $95 million to premium revenue in the 9 months ended September 30, 2014, while MMP-eligible members receiving only Medicaid benefits from Molina contributed another $95 million. Despite the rapid ramp-up in revenue, we have had some revenue-related issues this year. The most significant, of course, has been our inability to recognize as revenue the full reimbursement we believe we are owed from state Medicaid agencies for the ACA health insurer fee. To reiterate what Mario said, we have about $50 million of health insurer fee revenue for the full year of 2014 that we have not been able to recognize, even though all of the state Medicaid agencies have informally committed to full reimbursement, including tax effects. Without a formal commitment from those states, principally California, New Mexico and Texas, we will not be able to book any of the remaining $50 million this year. There is still the uncertainty surrounding the Texas quality revenue. We have about $35 million in potential quality revenue in Texas for all of 2014. Through September 30, we recognized only $8 million of that revenue. Unfortunately, we continue to await further clarification from the state. And given this late date, we are doubtful that we'll be able to recognize the full amount of our Texas quality revenue during 2014. Now let's move on to medical costs. I want to emphasize 3 points. First, the company's transition to a chronic care focus makes meaningful comparisons to last year's results difficult. As we've said before, premiums for long-term services and supports, or LTSS, are much greater than those for acute medical benefits. But the percentage margins for administrative costs and profit built into those rates is much lower than that for traditional medical benefits. Through September 30, 2014, we have recorded premium revenue of about $1.1 billion tied to members who are eligible for LTSS compared to only $700 million for the first 9 months of 2013. This 57% growth in LTSS revenue resulted in an increase to our medical expense ratio of 1.2% in the third quarter of 2014. To further demonstrate how our financial measurements are changing, despite the fact that our medical care ratio increased by 3% during 2014, our medical margin, as measured in dollars, increased by 8%. Again, as our business continues to grow and become more complex, we will be exploring new methods of presentation that better capture these characteristics. We find geographic descriptions are less informative than product descriptions. Second, as Mario pointed out, flat to very low rate increases across the company's traditional Medicaid business have resulted in higher medical ratio. Third, lack of coordination in the design of profit caps and medical cost floors in some of our contracts is resulting in counterproductive outcomes. In some instances, givebacks due to profitable performance in one product cannot be offset against losses in other products. We believe the resulting asymmetric assignment of risk is unfair to health plans and counterproductive to the goal of Medicaid programs to ensure access to care for all beneficiaries. For example, at our Washington health plan, adjustments to premium revenue as a result of minimum medical loss ratio requirements for the Medicaid expansion population, reduced income before taxes by approximately $17 million for the third quarter of 2014 and $23 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2014. Simultaneously, the Washington health plan incurred a medical care ratio in excess of 100% for its aged, blind and disabled members. However, we are unable to offset profits from our Medicaid expansion contract against our ABD contracts. The Washington health plan is therefore left in a position where it must return profits under its Medicaid expansion contract, while it receives no relief from losses incurred under its ABD contract despite very little differences between the 2 programs. In a similar manner, our New Mexico health plan received a new contract provision, limiting profits on retroactively added members, which reduced income before taxes by approximately $6 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2014. At the same time, the New Mexico health plan's LTSS program operated at a medical care ratio in excess of 100%. In reviewing our overall medical cost performance, I'll remind you of what we have said in the past. 2014 and 2015 will be years of rapid growth, while 2016 will be a year of stabilization. Stabilization and margin expansion will come as we integrate new member into our care models. Our past experiences in Ohio and California, where we have thrived in difficult situations by both managing care and getting appropriate premiums, gives us confidence as we look to the future. We continue to achieve greater administrative cost leverage. At our Investor Day event in 2013, we communicated how we were investing in infrastructure to support our growth, driving administrative costs as a percentage of revenue up to over 10% last year. Earlier this year, we discussed our expectations related to administrative costs for 2014. As expected, our administrative costs as a percentage of revenue have declined significantly during 2014 as our revenue has surged. General and administrative expenses were 7.2% for the third quarter of 2014, a decrease from 8.4% in the second quarter of 2014. We remain confident in the target of about 8% for the whole year of 2014. During the third quarter of 2014, the Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations related to compensation deduction limitations applicable to certain health insurance insurers. Pursuant to these final regulations, the company recorded a tax benefit during the third quarter of 2014 of approximately $7 million for periods prior to the third quarter of 2014. Days in claims payable this quarter increased by 4 to 50 days. As of September 30, 2014, the company had cash and investments of around $2.4 billion, including approximately $347 million at the parent. And cash flow from operating activities was very strong through September 30 at $841 million. We now believe that our earnings per diluted share and our adjusted earnings per diluted share may fall below the low end of the ranges included in our previously issued 2014 guidance. This is because, as we have disclosed in the past, our inability to fully recognize the ACA insurer -- health insurer fee revenue and the Texas quality revenue in 2014, along with medical care costs that are trending higher than we anticipated, as compared with our most recent full year 2014 estimates and the impact of certain contractual provisions that limit our ability to retain profits. At our Investor Day in 2012, we embarked on an ambitious plan to double our revenue, decrease our administrative ratio and increase our margin. We are well underway to accomplishing the first 2 of these goals. We have consistently stated that we're focused on this long-term plan and that investors should not be distracted by quarterly fluctuations that are inevitable. We remain just as excited about our prospects today, as we were when we announced that plan. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sarah James with Wedbush.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: I just wanted to get a little bit more color on what changed in your expectations. It sounds like the majority of it was just the 2 timing issues. I wanted to understand if it wasn't for the health insurance fee in Texas now looking more like the '15 than '14 event. Could you have maintained guidance? Or was there really something that changed inter-quarter on your understanding of the ability to net contracts and the state against each other when looking at profit caps?
John C. Molina: Look, Sarah, I think that there's a couple of things there. First of all, as you said, the majority of the disconnect is the timing on both Texas quality revenue and health insurer fee. Those combined are close to $70 million, almost $80 million. Then we had the Washington settlement in the third quarter, which was a drag of $11 million. And I think that the impact of the inability to net the profits is an issue. Did we know about it early on? I think we did, theoretically. We just didn't understand the impact and we certainly did not know about the take back in New Mexico, where the retroactive membership was capped at basically a 95% MCR, leaving very little room for profit there.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Got it. If I kind of just look at the -- what the clean numbers or run rate if I'm taking out those timing issues with the ACA fee, Texas, Washington payment that doesn't repeat. And you've mentioned before an SG&A number that wasn't matched timing-wise. I'm kind of getting close to $1.36 or so of nonrepeating headwinds. So when I think about go forward, the outlook, it looks a lot brighter going forward.
John C. Molina: Well, I think, as I said, we are excited by our prospects. We've got some very good revenue growth momentum. We've got Puerto Rico coming on next year, admin costs are coming down, just like we expected. So now it's a matter of us trying to work with the states on correcting some of these contract issues, getting some premium rate increases. As Mario said, for the base businesses, it's been a struggle in most of the states to get what we think are adequate rates. But yes, we think that we're in good position right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christian Rigg with Susquehanna International Group.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I just want to make sure I understand sort of the EPS in the quarter. So GAAP was $0.33, you've got $0.07 from the HIF, $0.05 from Texas quality, $0.14 from Washington penalty payment and then another sort of $0.15 benefit from the retroactive adjustment on the nondeductible comp tax issue. That gets me to about $0.44. Is that kind of the right way to think about it, maybe $0.01 or $0.02 lower for the in-quarter contribution from the nondeductibility of the comp?
John C. Molina: Joe is adding up the numbers right now as we speak. You're a little bit faster on your arithmetic than he is.
Joseph W. White: Yes, Chris, I think that's definitely a good way to look at it.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And then on the G&A absolute costs, my model I expected a similar amount of leverage. But obviously, I was a little higher than top line. But on an actual dollar amount, the G&A expenses declined fairly meaningfully quarter-to-quarter. Can you give us a sense for what drove that?
Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking again, Chris. It's a variety of things. I wouldn't expect that decline. I would just -- I wouldn't expect that decline to repeat in the fourth quarter as we gear up for Puerto Rico, and we consider what advertising investments we want to make, leading into 2015 enrollment for marketplace. It's -- I guess I would just say that the spending has its own cycles. And this quarter, we were just down a little bit. We're still -- I think John mentioned in his remarks, we're still -- we're not changing the overall guidance to 8% for the year. So I would just stick with what we talked about since February in terms of admin spend.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So I just want to dig into the medical cost issue, because that seems to be the one that is not timing-related, so -- and I feel like I've asked this in the past on certain situations like this. But I guess, which medical costs specifically are coming in higher? And maybe you can help us with your diligence process on when you're taking on some of these new contracts, especially some with high acuity. Do you use consultant actuaries? I'm just curious how you guys come up with sort of expectations, especially for these new populations. And again, maybe help us with which buckets have been the most surprising.
John C. Molina: Sure, Josh. This is John. I think the 2 or 3 areas that have the most meaningful, in terms of the MCR, would be the LTSS in New Mexico. Now we were given data from the state from New Mexico. That was a rate bid within a band. We were either the highest or the second highest in terms of what we bid. So given everything that we saw from the state, our actuaries and outside actuaries, we felt pretty good about that and it's still running in excess of 100%. We think the state just made some errors in some of their assumptions when they gave us the rate; most notably, the challenges of getting out and reaching all these members. I think secondarily, you've got the HOBD, or the blind and disabled, up in Washington. And what happened there was, again, we bid right in line with all the other managed care players using our actuaries, and I believe some consulting actuaries, and we were fine on the -- on that program in 2013. But again, the state then cut the rates because they assumed greater managed care savings than we told them we could get, and I think that all health plans expected to get. And it was a bit similar to the situation in Texas, where the actuaries in the state put it assumptions that are too aggressive. The state also included psychotropic and other high-cost drugs, but didn't give us the tools to manage that. And I think that cost us somewhere in the neighborhood of $1 million through 9 months. So like I say, some of these are programmatic things. I know that Florida looks a little bit out of the line. The MMA, new MMA members are coming in, I think, for the most part, in line. But you've got a pretty significant amount of the real high-cost nursing home patients there.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. So I mean, I guess my real question is you've got 5 states running MLRs over 90% at this point. So what's the response? I mean, growth is obviously important and helpful long term, and we're certainly willing to see growing pains, et cetera. But just when do you make a decision? I don't remember the last time Molina exited a program. So I mean, is there a point you're talking about chronic multiyear underpayment? Do you have to sort of put your foot down on any of these states and just say, enough is enough?
John C. Molina: Well, I think that the ones that had the most impact are Washington, certainly because of how large it is. And I think we've talked a little bit about the issues in Washington and some potential remedies. There's really not much different in terms of looking at the membership profiles of the ABD population in Washington and the expansion population. They're very close in age, they're very close in utilization, et cetera. Why not offset one line of business with the other? In Texas, that's over 90%. But a good chunk of that, of course, is the unrecognized revenue. Utah has traditionally grown very well. I think that's more of a Medicare issue, so that's why we're looking more at programs than geographies in the future.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. Can I just ask one quick on the tax rate? What's your expected tax rate going forward, now that you're no longer subject to that compensation deduction limitation?
Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking. I don't want to speak to 2015 yet, because this rate is very -- our effective tax rate is very much a product of what our pretax income is. So you, speaking just to the fourth quarter, Josh, a lot just goes to play out, it's just going to determine on whether we can pick up any of this ACA insurer fee revenue, if we can pick up any of this Texas quality revenue. If we don't pick that up, we're going to be left with a quarterly effective rate of probably between 60% and 65%. We have the issue of nondeductible expenses, which drive the effective rate up as pretax goes down. So worst case, it's somewhere north of 60%. If some of that insurer fee revenue comes in with the Texas quality revenue, it will be a little bit below that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I guess I think I agree with the concept that the MLR is high, it's new business, and you guys just had a track record of bringing down MLR over time. I guess, a lot of times when we see companies view that there is investments in G&A to get there, how comfortable are you that the G&A run rate is what you need? That you don't have to rollout new medical management programs in certain states to really get the MLR where it needs to be.
Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking. I think we're pretty comfortable that there's not going to be a huge amount of spend on additional management. Bear in mind that we capture a lot of the med management cost in our MLR, that you'd see on the books right now. And that's part of what's driving the higher MLRs. We've talked before about how we've had to staff up in terms of med management care coordination staff. And that's still the case as we roll out the MMP plans and dive into things like Centennial Care in New Mexico and MMA in Florida. So I think, if anything we're going to see from a percentage basis, a little bit of moderation on the admin portion that's built into our MLR.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Actually, if I can just ask one more. I guess I understand the comment about the rebate and the expansion states not being able to offset the other business, but I do believe that was kind of the point from the beginning. And it seems like the other companies that are -- reported Medicaid results, so far, really had pretty strong results broadly speaking. So I don't see that as a good explanation for why it was up. Because basically less new business is maximizing its earnings, which implies that the core business is the business that is not doing well. And to therefore break the core business, maybe into 2 buckets, I know one of your competitors does it this way what they think is interesting of kind of existing business versus new business. How much of the higher MLR would you say is really new business coming in higher versus existing business and having issues in any of the existing book of business?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, this is Mario. We are looking at changing the way we report. I think you sort of hit the nail on the head. You mentioned earlier that we don't think that a geographic approach, which is what we use when we are primarily a TANF is the best way to do this going forward. We talked about the areas where we really think we have medical cost issues. John mentioned those just a few minutes ago. So I don't think it's -- the other thing is, on the expansion side, the expansion membership has a much bigger impact with us than I think it does with most of the other companies, because we have had such a large expansion enrollment. So this is a bigger issue for us than it may be for some of them.
Joseph W. White: Okay. And Kevin, if I could just add one technical -- this is Joe speaking, one technical point to that, I think John spoke to the fact that, for the quarter, the MLR is probably about 1.2% higher based on the new LTSS business we've added for the MMPs Florida -- sorry, Centennial Care and Florida.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: So I guess, 1.2%, that could just be a mix shift issue rather than are you saying 1.2% higher just because it is high MLR business? Are you saying it's 1.2% higher, because that business is coming in higher than you thought? That's what I'm trying to get to, was it coming in higher than you thought?
Joseph W. White: No doubt it's a -- no doubt there's a mix shift there. On the other hand, I think if you look historically, we do tend to run higher MCRs when we first enter programs. Just a result of margin build and conservatism and everything.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Carter with Crédit Suisse.
Chris Carter: Could you just give us an update on how the opt-out rate for the duals is running versus the kind of 50% you previously talked about?
Terry P. Bayer: Yes, this is Terry. We updated you in September at Investor Day that the opt-out rate is coming in where we expected. And we were conservative and estimated would be about 50% in that is what we're seeing thus far.
Chris Carter: Got it. So no change. And then just on the California settlement agreement, can you just give us an update there in terms of where you stand in terms of that balance?
Joseph W. White: Sure. It's Joe speaking. Just to put the numbers in sequence: quarter 1, we had $5 million recorded for that as receivable; quarter 2, that went to $9.5 million; third quarter, it's down to $3.5 million, which reflects, obviously, better performance in California. So at 9/30, $3.5 million is booked as a receivable of the $40 million available.
Chris Carter: Okay. And then just maybe one more. I think you said over the next 9 months, you're going to add 500,000 members. I think, 350,000 is Puerto Rico. Can you maybe just break out for us the delta there?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, the rest is Illinois and Florida. We're picking up 65,000 members in Florida in December as a result of that acquisition, and then the continued growth in Illinois.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.
Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I was wondering if you could maybe characterize what your performance is like now with 9 months of visibility of expansion members. And how much specifically for that block it's varying state-by-state in where you have trouble or pressures in particular regions?
John C. Molina: Well, it's interesting Matt, this is John. When you compare the populations across states, they're very similar in terms of the demographics. The folks are -- we're seeing a lot of chronic conditions for this population. But we're not seeing -- we didn't see the initial utilization pick up in places like California and Washington that we saw in Michigan and Ohio. We think a lot of this is just an educational and a timing issue that folks haven't used services early on here because they didn't know they were available to them, they didn't understand the program. If you look at a study that was just put out by The New England Journal of Medicine...
Joseph Mario Molina: Yes, there was a paper. This is Mario. In The New England Journal of Medicine on October 23, a nice little 3-page article about the way that Michigan rolled out their new program for expansion. And some of the things they did, they put a lot of money up front into education, they were able to rapidly process and enroll people. And 36% of the patients that have enrolled have so far scheduled a primary care visit. So I think if you look at a state that's done it right, it was Michigan. I think states like California, where there have been problems with backlogs, have contributed to the lower utilization. But we think it's going to catch-up as people figure out that they've got insurance and they learn how to use it.
Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And what about with respect to the adequacy of rates? I realized it's relative to the underlying costs that you're talking about. But now that you have the visibility that you do, do you feel significantly better about the expansion funding than you do? I mean, maybe it's just -- sorry, if you could just talk on that?
Joseph Mario Molina: Yes. We believe that the rates are adequate. What we have a problem with is this asymmetric risk that we have in some of our contracts, where we have to return money where we're making profit and absorb losses in other contract areas when we're not. And that's part of the problem. We believe that these things should offset that the various product lines should all be evaluated together. But in terms of expansion, for the most part, we feel that the rates are adequate.
Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And is there an element of which these, the asymmetrical nature of the contracts, caught you by surprise? Or has it just been something that you struggled with on an ongoing basis and now it's hurting enough that you're bringing it more to our attention in terms of its prominence? And maybe related to that, if you could just touch on the New Mexico situation. Because that one, in particular, sounded like it was a surprise to you.
John C. Molina: Well, with respect to -- this is John. With respect to New Mexico, the surprise was the state implemented at on a retroactive basis, it wasn't part of the contract at the beginning of the year. So that was a surprise to us. I think that we did realize that there were profit caps and MCR floors, and Joe talked about that in the last Investor Day, is just typical of a much bigger bite in the third quarter than it had in the first 2.
Joseph W. White: It's is Joe speaking. I'd like just to add, too. I think we're seeing more stark disparities for different populations than we have in the past. It's just been a bit -- it's been surprising how the rates had been off so much between different programs. I don't think we've seen that before.
Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Right. Over in some cases and under in others, yes.
Joseph W. White: Yes.
John C. Molina: And Matt, that suggests that, over time, each side will correct itself.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Drilling down a little bit more in Florida. Can you maybe talk about the pressures you saw? I guess you highlighted nursing home services. Is that in MMA or is that related to in long-term care services you've already been offering there and one of your competitors talked about potential rate relief for a long-term care going back to September 1. Maybe update us on your thoughts around that as well.
Joseph W. White: Sure. It's Joe speaking, Andy. I'll start off with that question, or at least to get you started. A couple of observations. First, you remember, from an MMA perspective, we've only had these rates since July 1 and we have a very small population in Florida, which is something John alluded to in his remarks about how swings in some of these smaller states could be misleading. With that said, what we think we know now based on, again, all 3 months of data, our feeling is that while the MCR is high, it's not inconsistent with what we were expecting. We feel like pharmacy is pretty much within the tracks, within the range we expected it to be. We generally feel like both the Nursing Home and the Home and Community-Based Services are coming in as we've expected. We're seeing higher inpatient utilization, curiously enough, than we thought on the TANF side. So I wouldn't -- I don't think there's a whole lot to read into our Florida performance. We also, this quarter, have picked up about $2 million or $2.5 million of unfavorable prior period development from pretty far back in the calendar. And on a $100 million revenue base, that can be pretty distortive. So when Terry and I both spoke to Florida back at Investor Day in September, we talked about an MCR somewhere in the low 90s overall for that business, and I don't think we're seeing anything that would suggest it will be different.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And on the long-term care side around potential updates on rates for September, anything?
Joseph W. White: No, I don't think we have anything on it. I don't have anything on that, sorry.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And then clarifying on the tax update, the $7 million, is that for all of '13 and the first half of '14 there?
Joseph W. White: Yes, that's correct.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And was it -- is it roughly even every quarter? Or is there lumpiness within those numbers?
Joseph W. White: It's a little bit lumpy. It's -- about $6 million applies to last year. It has to do with the size of the executive comp we're expensing, which was higher last year. But essentially, it's about $6 million in '13 and then $1 million in the first half of this year.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, great. And then just a last one to squeeze in here. Any thoughts as we're heading into open enrollment here for the exchanges, obviously, not a major driver this year. But any thoughts about how that's going to change, maybe, heading into next year, you think?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, we were pretty conservative last year with our rates. And in a number of states, we've brought rates down to be more competitive. And I think that we are more competitive. Having things like the second lowest Silver or the cheapest Bronze plan in a number of markets. But remember that this is not going to be a big driver for our business. We've got 2.4 million Medicaid beneficiaries. We're going to add another 500,000 over the next 9 months. So while we think it's important from a strategic standpoint to put a toe in the water on the exchanges, the real drivers of our business are going to be Medicaid, Medicare duals, and that's not going to -- the exchanges are not going to make a huge contribution.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.
Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: On -- the first question is on the DCP. You've raised it quite considerably. What are your plans to -- I mean, is that going to stay where it is? And how are you thinking about this? This is somewhat unusual...
Joseph W. White: Ana, it's Joe speaking. We get a lot of questions about this over time. The best I can say on that is the DCP is a product of our -- of the reserve we set with our actuaries. We have a full process with an FSA employed by the company with a full team of actuaries who sets reserves every quarter. Those reserves are vetted by Ernst & Young. The way those shake out is the DCP shakes out from those reserve estimates. So I think it's fair to say we've got more liabilities. It's factual, we have more liabilities on the balance sheet than we have in the past, but we don't target the DCP specifically. My expectation is once these populations get established and we've addressed any kind of claims payment issues, which show up sometimes in the beginning of programs. We're going to drop back down into the mid-40s. I don't know when that will be though.
Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: Okay. So for the purposes of 2014, you're staying at the 50. As I go back to what we were told at your Investor Day in September and look at the swing factors for what might be bringing your guidance down. It sounds like the biggest one is the MLR, obviously, stating such an obviously thing. And then the offset would be the tax rate. Everything else seems kind of within the noise, if you will. Would you say, I guess, and I'm listening to all of -- or looking at your news release and listening to your commentary, it feels like you're saying, structurally, your loss ratio is now trending upward. And it's not just about kind of one initial spike or anything, it's just that you're getting lower rates and you have pressures on your -- whatever profitability caps and so on. And so is that fair? I somehow kind of come out thinking, the Medicaid Expansion and potentially even duals, the rate setting was a little more fair, and so you might at least be neutral if not better.
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, Ana, I think I would say that a little differently. I think what we tried to emphasize is that the -- we assumed that we would get 100% of the Texas pay-for-performance quality revenue and the health insurer fee. And those are things that are largely beyond our control, and we really thought this would be resolved by this time of the year. Now that we are nearly in November and they're still not resolved, we don't have as much confidence, and we tried to convey that to everyone. There is a slight upward trend in the MCR, and we tried to explain that. A lot of it has to do with certain contracts in certain states. I don't think that it's necessarily a overall widespread trend. I mean, you can really talk about this as 3 -- I think 3 major states that are a problem: Washington, Texas and New Mexico. And it has to do with issues around the expansion and the contracts, it has to do with the inability to offset givebacks and losses, and it has to do with the inability to recognize the insurer fee and the quality revenue. I think that a component of it is the medical care ratio. But medical care ratio is a ratio, it's not the medical cost per se, and that can be affected by a lot of things. And so when we're giving revenue back to states, it affects the MCR, but not because medical costs are rising or because we're having medical management difficulties. Certainly, over time, I think we can whittle these things down. You also have to remember, and I -- we haven't talked about this. But when you bring in a lot of these new populations like the duals and like Centennial Care, there are requirements to do initial health assessments, and often to make home visits. And a lot of this is an up front cost that we're bearing because of the large influx of new members. So that's been a strain. We've had lots of problems with eligibility in New Mexico. We are getting members retroactively back to January, they're coming on in October, and it's because the enrollment system that ACS built has been problematic. So anytime you have enrollment issues, and we've seen this in other states in the past, when they implemented new systems, it makes things very difficult for us. We need to know who's on the plan, when they're on the plan and where they live and how to reach them. And in some cases, we only know that for 1/3 of the members.
Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: Okay. I don't want to belabor too much. One -- just one final point though. Should we -- as we think about past '14, which is, as you've said, a transition year, as we model '15, is it an okay thing? Or am I just being too optimistic to model like an 89%-ish ratio? Or should we kind of be thinking about 90.5%, 91% blended?
John C. Molina: Come in February, Ana, and we'll clarify it for you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies.
David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: I want to reframe it a slightly different way. What I hear you saying to, in several questions, is that there are a lot of fairly discrete large-dollar amount items that are subject to a signature, a negotiation, an agreement with the state, things that Dr. Molina, you just mentioned are kind of out of your control -- I guess, there, at least in your control, to put shoulder against the yield and continue to push. If you don't get them this year, I mean, what is a reasonable time frame for us to think about you're ultimately getting some of these things? And then secondly, when you do get them, do you expect that they will be retroactive back to the beginning of the period we've been measuring?
Joseph Mario Molina: So yes, let me respond to that. I do think these things will be retroactive. We have had discussions with the state of Texas. They recognize that the health insurer fee is a legitimate cost and they believe there's an obligation to pay it. We know that the state of California is planning to submit a rate amendment for approval by CMS in November that will cover this period. The problem is, even if CMS were to do that, it often takes 60 to 90 days to get that amendment processed at the state, get the contracts signed and the check cut. So I think we will get paid. I'm just not sure that we're going to get paid in this year. The other problem we have is that while we have had communications with them, they haven't put it in writing sufficient that we can accrue the revenue. So it's not that we believe the revenue's not coming, and there's some big chunks of it out there, but this is mostly going to be a timing issue. Nevertheless, it will affect, from an accounting standpoint, the results for 2014 if we don't secure those written agreements before the end of the year.
John C. Molina: And, Dave, this is John. Let me just follow up one thing. We have every confidence that on the HIF stuff, we're going to collect it, we don't want people to run wild if we collect $50 million in the first quarter of next year, for example, and think that's a run rate. So that's why we are downplaying a lot of these quarter-to-quarter fluctuations and looking out for the long term.
David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Understood. Just a quick follow-up on that. The -- in your press release, your HIF fee collection or expectation for the fourth quarter actually drops from what you collected in the third quarter. Could you explain that for me?
Joseph W. White: Sure. It's Joe speaking, Dave. I think we noted that in this quarter, Utah and Michigan caught up and, in effect, paid 75% or 9 months worth of that base fee. Not the tax effect, but the base fee. So there's a catch up in the quarter.
David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then my final question kind of come. Sorry, go ahead. I was just saying my final...
Joseph W. White: The one we're going to focus on is that $50 million still out there.
David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. Final question, coming back to kind of confidence of negotiations. Dr. Molina, what would -- how would you describe your confidence on negotiating with the states around these potential offsets relative to the confidence on collecting the HIF fee?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, I think that we enjoy good relationships with our state partners. And I think that they are unattended consequences of their actions, so I think that if there's strong policy arguments as to why these things should be changed. Any time you come in with new contracts and new programs or you expand populations, there are always unforeseen results. So I think there's a good chance that we can get some relief on these things. It just makes sense.
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I think we understand the HIF and the Texas quality payments and the Washington settlements going on. But I'd like to get what's causing the loss ratio to be higher? And how much higher is it? If I adjust for those 3 things in this quarter, I still come up with a loss ratio that's over 90%. So can you tell us what you were expecting in this quarter relative to sort of that 90%, 90.1% or so?
John C. Molina: All right. So yes, Pete, I think that the -- one of the big drivers is the double whammy in the state Washington with the ABD population having a higher MCR. Now remember, while it was a net $11 million drag, it was really a $19 million unfavorable hit. And most of that, if not all of that, hit the ABD line. And so you have this ABD problem, and then we had the revenue reduction due to the giveback of $17 million?
Joseph W. White: Correct. It's the adjustment for the MLR floor and Washington, Pete. That's $23 million year-to-date, but $17 million of that was in the third quarter. So if I were modeling, I might take that $23 million and spread it over 3 quarters rather than cram it all into the third quarter.
John C. Molina: I think the other thing to note is that Washington does their calculations slightly differently for the expansion than the rest of the states in which we have contracts, and that does have some impact. We haven't quantified it yet, but we just know that the arithmetic is different. And then you've got New Mexico with both a higher LTSS. We thought that, that was going to come in a high 90s, not over 100%. And that is then exacerbated by the retroactive issues related to, as Mario said, the retroactive membership.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. I'll try that a little -- slightly different way. The stuff that can be resolved from a rate change that's not 1 of those, the 3 things that we've already talked about a lot, when do you expect those rate actions to potentially happen for you next year as opposed to just your normal regular way, improving the cost trend of the business and getting the new members to have lower loss ratios over time? What do you expect from rate actions to help you out, and when?
Joseph W. White: Okay. We're having more rates come up Jan 1 than we did before. A lot of states have shifted it. So I think New Mexico has shifted. Washington, we're having those discussions right now. And whether or not we get rate increases or policy changes that have a similar effect, it's a little too early to tell right now.
Joseph Mario Molina: Yes, this is Mario. I think if you look at what happened with California when they brought the ABDs in, for a long time, 1 year, 1.5 years, there was a lot of turmoil. But California eventually got it right. And if you look at the performance of the California health plan, there's been a dramatic change. And so you see what getting the rates right can do. But we need to work with the states' actuaries and some of their policy people to make them understand this.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then for Puerto Rico, what are you expecting for a loss ratio on that business when it first starts up with you?
John C. Molina: We're not talking about Puerto Rico other than just the membership and the revenue, because that was put out by the Medicaid agency. We'll talk about other expectations probably in February.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And what were your Hep C costs in the quarter?
Joseph Mario Molina: Yes, the Hep C costs are built into the pharmacy numbers that we reported. It hasn't been extraordinary. However, having said that, with this new drug being approved, I think a lot of doctors have been warehousing their patients waiting for an all-oral option, and I expect Hep C costs to rise. There was a letter that came from the financial association of Medicaid directors that went to the Senate Finance Committee asking for some sort of action to be taken. There's also a lot of concern being raised by people in corrections where the states are completely on the hook for the care of the patients there. And we're seeing a lot of people who are voicing a lot of concerns about how these drugs have been priced. So I think in the next year, you're going to see some action there. We also have some carve out arrangements in Florida and Washington which, I think, will be helpful. So all the states are looking at this. Everybody's scratching their head trying to figure out what to do, but I don't think it's going to go along status quo in 2015.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carl McDonald with Citigroup.
Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: So one follow-up on the Puerto Rico contract. You had some prior experience there where you were awarded the contract, didn't like the rates and ended up not participating. Is this contract finalized and you are comfortable with the planned reimbursement?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, first of all, I don't think the contract is finalized yet. And secondly, the previous procurement was withdrawn. So it wasn't a matter of we didn't like the rates, we didn't sign. We never got that far because the whole procurement was withdrawn.
Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Got it. I actually -- as you responded, I realized I think I'm confusing you with -- Centene may have won a couple of RFPs ago and pulled out. So I'll just withdraw that question. The other question I had was on the compensation deduction, since there's no explicit piece of that, that excludes Medicaid plans or government plans generally, I'd just be interested in why you think the Medicaid business would be exempt from that and whether there's been any conversation with either Treasury or IRS or if it's just the opinion of the tax and legal advisers.
Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking. To your last question, no, there hasn't been any specific discussion with the IRS about this. The -- we feel like, no, the preamble to the final regs is pretty clear about how the de minimis test is going to be calculated. And what that de minimis test really comes down to, obviously, is a numerator and the denominator. And we are very confident the way we read the final regs that, that numerator would exclude Medicaid premiums. Now let me just say though that test for recognition of income tax expense is more likely than not. So Carl, this is not like a revenue recognition issue where the standard of recognition is near certainty. This is the more likely than not test. But we've spoken to our tax advisers. We've read the preamble of the final regs. We've read the final regs. We've been through the de minimis test, and we're confident we pass it.
Joseph Mario Molina: And Carl, the auditors have bought off on this. And I think just our tradition of pretty conservative accounting should give you some comfort.
Operator: That was our last question. I'll turn the call back to you, Mr. Orellana.
Juan José Orellana: Well, thank you very much for listening to our quarterly call. We look forward to talking to you next time. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

Joseph Mario Molina:  Thank you, Juan José. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we report our second quarter results. We are pleased that the results for 2014 are unfolding as we anticipated when we provided guidance in February. The three key elements that we shared with you in February remain critical for our success in 2014, and they have not changed. These elements are the growth of membership and revenue, the provision of high quality cost effective care to our members and improving administrative efficiency. The membership continues to increase and we finished the second quarter with approximately 2.3 million members up from 1.85 million members at the end of the second quarter of 2013, an increase of 22%. In fact, we added over 100,000 members since last quarter alone. Much of this growth is due to the expansion of Medicaid that is added over 230,000 members since last year, and has exceeded the 160,000 new expansion members that we had projected in guidance at our February Investor Day. Several sates including California, Michigan and Illinois where we have health plan operations have reported backlogs affecting the processing of applications for Medicaid. For example, California reported a backlog of 600,000 applications, but they expect to cut the backlog to 350,000 by September. In Illinois, the backlog has decreased from 500,000 in April to 150,000 in June. As the states processed the backlog of applications, we expect to see our Medicaid enrollment continue to grow. The new members that are enrolling as a result of the Medicaid expansion tend to be slightly older compared to our channel members. The Urban Institute estimated that nearly 50% of the uninsured are over 35 years of age, consistent with this estimate, about 60% of our Medicaid expansion members are over 35 years old. It is too soon for us to know exactly what the final cost and characteristics of these members will ultimately be. Total revenue is tracking in line with our expectations, and is up 44% as compared to the second quarter of 2013, this is consistent with the growth in membership, and the shift to members that are older and have more complex medical needs. These members come with higher premiums. At 89.3% of premium, medical costs are higher than the same quarter a year ago when they were 86.2%. However, it is difficult to make meaningful comparisons to last year, because of the change in our member demographics. What is more important is that, Medical costs are in line with the 89% that we projected in guidance for 2014. Let me speak for a moment on Florida. First, it’s important to note that we have limited exposure in Florida due to our relatively small enrollment in that state, and that our participation in the Managed Medical Assistance or MMA program did not begin until July 1. Once the program is fully implemented, Molina Healthcare will be operating in only three regions 7, 9 and 11, which geographically speaking represents Central Florida, the Florida Treasure Coast and South Florida. As part of the implementation of the new Medicaid contract awards in that state, we’ve had to exit some markets and start operations in others. This has resulted in temporary declines in enrollment in June and July as we exited Tampa and Boulevard Counties. However, the membership decline will be offset with new membership in Miami-Dade, which started on July 1, as well as Orlando and Palm Beach Starting August 1. We will closely monitor the implementation to determine how it is tracking with our expectations. The life and pharmacy costs reflects the higher cost of drugs in general. The increased prescription drug needs of some of our new members, and the cost of new drug such as Sovaldi. While the utilization of Sovaldi appears to have plateaued in the second quarter, we remain concerned about the high cost of Gilead Sovaldi and the impact it could have on state Medicaid budgets. We are even more concerned about the future impact of specialty drugs, of which Sovaldi is just a single example. Competition generally brings with it lower costs. However, the specialty drug market may be an exception. Senator Wyden from Oregon and Senator Grassley from Iowa recently wrote and “In order for a marketplace to function properly, it must be competitive, fair and transparent, it is unclear how Gilead set the price for Sovaldi that price appears to be higher than expected given the cost of development and production and the steep discounts offered in other countries, an efficient market needs to inform consumers to keep costs down”. We at Molina hope that in the future the pricing of specialty drugs by pharmaceutical companies will be competitive, fair and transparent. Another important strategic objective for this year and next year is the implementation of six demonstration contracts for the coordination of care for patients eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. These so called duals represent much higher medical costs than typical for Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries. They tend to have multiple chronic medical conditions and they face obstacles associated with poverty that further complicate their care. We are very proud to have been selected to participate in the Medicare/Medicaid plans demonstration programs. In addition to the 44,000 duals, we currently serve through our dual-eligible special needs plans, we began enrolling members in the MMP demonstration contracts in Illinois, California, and Ohio. Recall, that these dual eligible beneficiaries are first given the opportunity to enroll with a health plan that will coordinate both their Medicaid and Medicare benefits. Those that fail to do so will be assigned to a health plan through the process of passive enrollment. However, the beneficiaries have the right to elect, to continue to receive their Medicare benefits on a fee-for-service basis by opting out of the demonstration plan. We projected that 50% of the duals would opt out. Our experience so far leads us to believe that this is still a realistic estimate. There has been no change to the timeline for the implementation of our duals contracts for other states. We expect that these contracts will be implemented in Michigan, South Carolina and Texas in 2015. In keeping with our commitment to have all of our health plans accredited by NCQA for Medicaid, we are proud to announce that our health plan in Wisconsin received accreditation from NCQA in April of this year. Finally, we continue to see progress in administrative efficiency. Our general and administrative expense ratio declined sequentially to 8.4% in the second quarter of 2014. We expect this trend to continue as we guided to approximately 8% for the whole year. The quarter was negatively affected by three issues. The first is reimbursement of the health insurance fee or excise tax that is part of the Affordable Care Act. The second is the non-deductibility of this fee that increases our effective tax rate. And the third is the decision by the company to delay the recognition of some of the quality incentive revenue under our contract with the state of Texas. These are the same issues that affected our earnings last quarter as well. John will discuss these three issues in greater detail in a moment. The second quarter of 2014 much like the first quarter was consistent with our expectations and the guidance that we provided in February. We continue to make progress towards our goals for the year. Now, I will turn the call over to John.
John C. Molina:  Thank you, Mario, and hello everyone. As we previously discussed, we are focusing on adjusted net income as our reporting metric, as we feel it better reflects how we manage our business. For the second quarter, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.71 per diluted share. Overall, membership grew by 22% compared with the second quarter of 2013 and sequentially by 5%. Premium revenue has grown again this quarter to $2.2 billion, up 12% compared with the first quarter 2014. General and administrative expense ratio declined sequentially by 70 basis points to 8.4% in the second quarter of 2014 from 9.1% in the first quarter of 2014. The positive development I just outlined occurred despite some adverse factors which carried over from the first quarter of 2014. These include the delays in some of our states and securing agreements for the reimbursement of the Affordable Care Act’s Health Insurer Fee, as well as a gross up to cover the non-deductibility of that fee, and delays in the recognition of quality-related revenue at our Texas Health plan. These delays reduced earnings by a combined total of approximately $23 million or $0.20 per diluted share for the second quarter and $45 million or $0.41 per diluted share for the six months ended June 30, 2014. In other words, have we caught up in the second quarter with all of these timing differences, our year-to-date results would have been higher by $0.41. Total revenue this quarter increased by about $240 million, a 12% increase over the first quarter of 2014. The increase was due mainly by higher Medicaid expansion enrollment. Since the first quarter of 2014, our Medicaid expansion membership experienced a significant jump of almost 100,000 members, a 75% increase. As Martha mentioned, our current Medicaid expansion enrollment now exceeds the guidance of 160,000 that we laid out in February. As we previously discussed, we decided to delay recognition of a portion of the Texas Quality Revenue. To refresh your memory, the state implemented several new quality measures in 2014. Health plans earned this revenue by demonstrating improved performance for certain metrics in 2014 over 2013. The calculation of these new measures is extraordinarily complex and is performed on the state’s behalf by a third party using proprietary software. It is the state’s intent to distribute 2013 base line data to health plans some time in the second half of this year. We are calculating our performance against the measures today using our best estimates. But without seeing the state’s methodology, we believe it is prudent to see that our performance in 2014 is better than what the state has measured for 2013 performance, before we recognize any revenue for these measures. In the first half of the year, we had about $13 million in quality revenue in Texas that we decided not to recognize. Medical costs this quarter experienced a modest increase partially offsetting the benefit from the increased revenue. We don’t consider the change in medical care ratio between the first quarter and the second quarter to be significant. We believe that the rapid growth in our membership in the first half of the year coupled with the introduction of new benefits like long-term care services and new programs like Medicaid expansion make the fluctuations in medical care ratio between the first and second quarter less meaningful. Our anticipation is that our medical care ratios will remain influx during 2014 driven by factors such as pent-up demand, retroactive eligibility changes, member confusion regarding when and how to access care, and delays in our receded claims for services provided. However, we expect that the overall trend will remain in line with our guidance for the year. We are pleased to improve our administrative cost leverage this quarter. General and administrative expenses were 8.4% for the second quarter 2014, a decrease from 9.1% in the first quarter of 2014. Our expectation remains that as new programs are implemented, and their associated revenues finally start hitting our books. We will gain further administrative leverage resulting in a lower administrative expense ratio. So far, the decline in G&A ratio is trekking closely to the quarterly estimates we provided at Investor Day, positioning us well towards achieving our 7.5% target for the fourth quarter of 2014, and an overall 8% for the entire year. Finally, an update on our effective tax rate. The non-deductibility of the ACI Health Insurer Fee continues to affect our financial results through higher effective tax rates. We have recorded an effective tax rate of around 58% this quarter. Days and claims payable was flat at 46. And as of June 30, 2014 the company had cash and investments of around $1.9 billion including approximately $300 million at our parent company. The company’s guidance for fiscal year 2014 remains unchanged, and is as follows. Adjusted net income per diluted share in the range of $4 to $4.50; and net income per diluted share in the range of $1.65 to $2.15. Our operations are tracking as anticipated as Mario suggested, but the timing of the ACA Health Insurer Fee in the Texas Quality Revenue may not be resolved until the fourth quarter. We believe these are timing differences not operating issues. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we’ll now take questions.
Operator:  Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Justin Lake with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Michael A. Newshel – JPMorgan:  Hi, this is Mike Newshel in for Justin actually. So with the variation of guidance, last quarter you said your bias was towards the upper end of the range, is there any change there in terms of how the quarter came in?
Joseph Mario Molina:  I think that we’re tracking just as we’ve said in the script, and in the press release.
Michael A. Newshel – JPMorgan:  So you won’t – you’re not earning the upper end of the guidance range, just sort of the whole – just laying out, it’s going to fall within the whole range?
John C. Molina:  That’s right. And specifically on the MLR, I mean it sounded like, you go with an up tick that was – that may have fluctuated above what you’re expecting for the quarter, but still was in line for the full year. I mean is it in line with what you’re expecting for the quarter or just if not so high, that it’s still within the same guidance range?
Joseph Mario Molina:  This is Mario, if you look at our Medical Care ratio for the first six months of the year, it comes in right at 89%, and that’s right in line with guidance.
Michael A. Newshel – JPMorgan:  Got you. And specifically, on the Medicaid expansion, are they still tracking around 88%? That you mentioned.
Joseph Mario Molina:  Again no, everything right now is tracking in line with guidance.
Michael A. Newshel – JPMorgan:  Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush. Please proceed.
Sarah James – Wedbush Securities Inc.:  Thank you. It looks like California MLR just keeps improving. Things are going very well there. Are you guys paying back under the EBIT agreement by now, and what should we think about as a run rate MLR under that agreement?
John C. Molina:  Sarah, this is John. No we have not started paying back we still have a reserve or receivable from the stake. I think the run rate for California again there is a lot of changes in California especially now with the doors coming on, but as Mario said I think overall the picture is we are right tracking with guidance.
Sarah James – Wedbush Securities Inc.:  Got it. And I hit a several back on this, but when I think about specific to this quarter, and the expansion number should if I am kind of doing the math on where run rate have been for a couple of markets and where MLR ended up it's just looked like a little bit higher than the number and some of the expansion in states like Illinois, Michigan, Utah, Washington. So I got the rest on tracks for the year, but just specific to this quarter are they at 88% or maybe that was never meant to be a quarterly specific number maybe that was the year end. Could you just talk about that a little bit.
John C. Molina: Sarah, here is the challenge while Illinois, Ohio and Michigan are expansion, they didn’t have much expansion enrollment in the quarter. It’s really hard to get that granular and give you folks a picture of the overall half of the company. So, rather than try to figure out what the MLR is for the expansion population in X-state or Y state. The message is everything combined is tracking per guidance just like we have been talking about.
John C. Molina:  Sarah, this is Mario. Let me just add if you look at the six biggest states that we have California, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, Texas and Washington, four of those states are tracking with MLR’s below 89%, and two of them are above. So again I think overall it’s tracking within expectation and I don’t place a lot of emphasis on a small state like Illinois, it doesn’t really impact the numbers that much. So, we tend to focus more on the bigger states.
Sarah James – Wedbush Securities Inc.:  Okay. Thank you.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.
Peter Heinz Costa – Wells Fargo Securities:  If you look at most of your states that they grew in membership a little bit sequentially and yet the loss ratios mostly relative as well. So, just the new membership is coming on at higher loss ratios. But I guess it wouldn’t be a typical, but if that continues and you’re talking about the members coming on from the back of the state. Do you think that your loss ratio should actually raise generally speaking through the rest of the year? And how confident are you that they’re not going to raise it at a more accelerated rate than you’re already looking at right now.
John C. Molina:  So Peter we always have higher cost from the new programs come on as Mario said, for the first half of the year the MLR, we haven’t see or rather is about 89% we’re expecting to end the year by 89%, so I think that sort of addresses your question.
Peter Heinz Costa – Wells Fargo Securities:  Yes, but if you look at the trend that you’ve seen, it seems like it would be driving it slightly different direction, so what gives you the confidence that it’s not going to continue to go with higher loss ratio as we go forward.
John C. Molina:  Take California as an example. California is the state that’s had the most growth, and their medical loss ratio is actually coming down. So I don’t think you can just make a blanket statement that the medical loss ratio is trending up and they were not going to hit that 89%. We still believe that the guidance number 89% is the right number.
Peter Heinz Costa – Wells Fargo Securities:  I am just looking at generally your state, the state patterns other than California. California is a little bit of an exception with an improving loss ratio sequentially. Most dealers once, it didn’t improve particularly where you had membership growth.
John C. Molina:  Well. We still maintained at 89% that we’ve put in guidance is the correct number for the year. And Peter remember we will always discussed that has the population sort of ages in as we have more time to get people under care management et cetera, we can bring them the medical care ratio down. So while may gone up sequentially, it will start to track down.
Peter Heinz Costa – Wells Fargo Securities:  Okay.
Joseph W. White:  Peter, its Joe White speaking. Hi, as you can imagine, I’m speaking because we’re going to get into a technical discussion right now which we try to avoid. You also though have to look at when you measure the quarter-over-quarter developments, you have to look at the way our estimate of our 12/31/13 claims liability played out. If you recall back to the first quarter, we anticipated picking up about $51 million of favorable prior period development from 12/31/13 that dropped to $37 million in the second quarter, about a $14 million swing. And within individual states, I don’t want to go into that much detail state-by-state, but prior period development of that size can move individual states pretty significantly.
Peter Heinz Costa – Wells Fargo Securities:  That’s helpful. Thank you very much.
Joseph W. White:  Sure.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please proceed.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays:  Thanks. I just want to follow-up on Joe’s response here real quick, so relative to historical norms or normal course of business prior period reserved development was there any abnormal or was there any negative development in the second quarter.
Joseph Mario Molina:  Certainly we did again Josh, I'm talking about the development to be clear of the reserve we established the 12/31/13. It didn’t come in as robustly, as we using anticipates. I think a couple of states may have actually met them below the margin, but the many states were essentially beneath the target margins I think we can’t attribute that any specific thing other than I just sink with the new membership we got sharing in January 1. I think our claims payment was delayed a little bit which extended our lag factors a bit.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays:  Okay. And then massive pick on Illinois, but Illinois was like it’s mostly new membership right it’s tools and expansion. And the MLR is 106%, so is that – in my understand I would be surprised if you had enough claims data to make a call one way the other. So I would assume that sort of an underwritten margin. So is that what you’re expecting, we are expecting based on the rates that you were seeing that you be in the 106% range. Or do you actually have some claims data already that putting you towards a level that is higher than expected.
Joseph W. White:  Again it’s Joe speaking, and we’re venturing into a accounting technicalities here, but one of the real challenge is with according to the MCR in Illinois is that with anticipation the expanded enrollment and with anticipation of the dual eligibles coming on, we had a front load a lot of our medical management staff. So, if you think a typical health plan, if you think consolidated basis, normally what we called quality assurance costs, medical management runs about 2.5% of revenue. And Illinois it’s running about 10% of revenue. So, certainly it’s one of our higher costs medical markets, but if you normalized for the administrative costs burden, the medical management burden, you knock about 10% off for that MLR for Illinois.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays:  Got it. And you put all of those quality expenses in the medical cost line?
Joseph W. White:  Correct.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays:  Okay consistent with any IT guidelines et cetera. So and then, one more question for you the opt-out rates, I’m just looking at the second quarter, it looks like you're about 62%. I think you guys have been talking about 50% opt-out rate. Can you sort of maybe just walk us through the timings of the dual roll out? So this is an issue where you’ve got a timing issue and that – this will migrate more towards 50% or is that 62% in line with your expectation?
Joseph W. White:  Josh, it’s Joe and Terry is going to get into the more substantive business explanation of this in a minute. But as far as how we’ve reported this not the numbers, that the major factor here is Ohio. Unlike our other MMP states, in Ohio the state is enrolling in every one for their Medicaid benefits and the individual until January 1 to receive the Medicare piece of the MMP has to opt in. So the result of that is, we are getting a lot of – we are starting to get members in Ohio who are default to just in the Medicaid piece of the MMP benefit, and have chosen not to opt into the Medicare piece. So the result of that is what you see right there on the – in terms of the way we disclose enrollment in the earnings release.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays:  And so…
Joseph W. White:  Terry is…
Terry P. Bayer:  Josh I will just add two more factors and at this point we are telling you that we are tracking toward that 50% opt-out number which is one we put in guidance we don’t have any indication will not be there. Some people opt-out before they ever come into the program some opt-out in the first month there are in the program, but what Joe just explained Ohio was a different situation where the path of enrollment will not begin until next January. So you got Medicaid coming in and then a voluntary opt-in on the others. So there are so many factors I think we’ve discussed it late and look at Illinois, California and Ohio from our different points in the voluntary and passed that process and our conclusion is that we are not seeing that we will exceed that 50% of opt-in. The bottom line is too early to tell we are waiting for that information to finally come in.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays:  So just to clarify in Ohio then, all of these individuals have been assigned Medicaid.
Terry P. Bayer:  Yeah.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays:  Possibly. And then they will get their Medicare assignment on January 1 possibly as well. And then there is probably an opt-out period after that as well.
Terry P. Bayer:  Correct. They can opt out of Medicare at any time, I just want to also clarify for you the entire Ohio enrollment has not been assigned yet will that’s coming in segments and you are seeing in the June 30 numbers, only the first half in selected regions that will continue to occur over the next month or two.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays:  Right. You will get a big bump in the auto assignment for Jan I and then it will sort of come down a little bit as people opt-out after that.
Terry P. Bayer:  Yes. But even the Medicaid is coming in over the course of couple of months not all at once.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays:  Got it. Okay. Thanks.
Operator:  Our next question comes from a line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Kevin Fischbeck – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch:  Okay. Great, thanks. I am struggling to fully understand some of the commentary that you guys made so far. And I will get the 10-Q it looks like in the quarter California got a bunch of payments that were out of period revenue payments related to Q1 of 2013 which I believe may be MLR look lower by back that was not coming up with MLR up 150 basis points sequentially, is that the right way to think about it? And if so want to go back to the question earlier about revenue growth and rising trend in MLR?
Joseph Mario Molina:  Sure. It’s Joe speaking yes. I think the way you laid it out is a way I would lay it out on, the California benefited from other period revenue adjustment in the quarter that more or less offset consolidated prior period development. So we didn’t see I need to call that one on a consolidated basis, Kevin. But when everyone started to talk about individual health plan performance, I was just making the point that unfavorable prior period development on a comparative basis from the previous quarter easily squeeze other health plan MLRS. So I think the way to look at it is without going into too much detail, California’s MCR helped by the $15 million of out of period revenue, the other health plans hurt by prior period development.
Kevin Fischbeck – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch:  Yeah. I think the number was 2015 the sideline Q1 that’s obviously a 2014 numbers, do you include in the 2014 to offset 2015, 2013 that you would back out?
Joseph Mario Molina:  Exactly, 2015 versus 2015 for last year.
Kevin Fischbeck – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch:  Okay. So I mean it does seem then like on a normalized basis that generally speaking I understand the concept of relating that’s hard to get a clean numbers if you don’t have prior, but it’s still directionally feel that the comment before that new enrollment coming and higher costs. Generally speaking is the right way to think about it and I think you guys have also talked about that historically that when you don’t have visibility on claims you take a little bit more conservative thoughts on MLR, So it is interesting that we have that enrollment coming on normally we would think it should be a higher MLR, the bridge in the ramping guidance is pretty dramatic obviously you are expecting to get the healthcare insurance fee in terms of payments. So, I just trying to think about the bridge there is it all about the G&A reduction and exceeding that is that kind of other big reason for the dramatic increase in earnings when MLR might not be the answer.
Joseph Mario Molina:  That’s a big. It’s Joe speaking again. That’s a big chunk of it. I don’t want to model for everybody, but if you look at if you do the, if you look at where guidance is at on the revenue side versus where we’re today for the first half and then take the impact of the admin ratio, we talked about for the year which we still believe we’re going to get, it’s a pretty substantial number drop into the bottom line.
Kevin Fischbeck – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch:  Okay. And then just last question on the Texas incentive payments, just want to get an update, any color you can provide about your conversation you had with the state about where you’re versus those numbers and obviously that’s maybe restriction way it actually book at the just any color you have about the confidence of actually hitting those numbers.
John C. Molina:  This is John. We’ve got our own internal calculations that we feel pretty comfortable with our performance is improving, but until we see what the base line is and we have to get that from the state and they have to get that from the third party vendor it’s impossible for us to know.
Kevin Fischbeck – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch:  Is that timing on the Q3 event or is that Q4?
John C. Molina:  They have told us Q3, but space it we recognized that often times when states are rolling out new data that there are delays.
Kevin Fischbeck – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch:  Okay. All right. Thanks.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carter with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Chris Carter – Credit Suisse:  Thanks, good afternoon. Just quick when I go back to your Investor Day book, I think I come up with a target of around 60,000 duals I think you’re targeting for the year. I mean you guys on pace for that, given where you are today?
John C. Molina:  That’s a good question.
Joseph Mario Molina:  I think it’s Joe speaking again, I mean, I think that point since and we’ve talked about the delays is the rollouts in…
John C. Molina:  South Carolina.
Joseph Mario Molina:  Michigan and South Carolina. So, we don’t want to go in that level of detail, but I think it’s fair to say we’ll come up a little bit less than that.
Chris Carter – Credit Suisse:  Got it. Okay. And then just on the Texas MLR, I mean that looked elevated in the quarter. Is that just simply related to the revenue recognition or anything else going on there?
Joseph W. White:  It's Joe speaking. Again, yes, it’s the revenue recognition it’s also if you look at it compared to last year it’s also add to do with some timing of recognition of profit sharing to back of the stay.
Chris Carter – Credit Suisse:  Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please proceed.
David H. Windley – Jefferies:  Hi, thanks for taking the question. So a follow-up on the dual Medicare opt-out, I’m wondering beyond the obvious that you don’t get the medicare premium portion, are there other implications to that opt-out in terms of your ability to manage the members care and perhaps the saving assumptions that are baked into the premium that you are getting.
John C. Molina:  I think that we are still going to be responsible for managing the long term care benefits. The savings that are baked in are baked in only for the MMP program. So if they are not fully enrolled there is no savings expectation. They are essentially like our Texas STAR PLUS members, where we are responsible for the long term care benefits, but there is no associated savings, the savings idea was that if you could co-ordinate the care for both Medicare and Medicaid there would be some synergy and some cost savings, to the extent that the members don’t participate in both programs that are outside of that contract.
Joseph W. White:  And that how we have modeled it in our guidance.
David H. Windley – Jefferies:  Okay and so you feel like the premium that you will get in opt-out situation is appropriate for the benefits and the savings that you’re responsible for?
Joseph W. White:  That’s right.
David H. Windley – Jefferies:  Okay.
Joseph W. White:  Yeah. And I also think that there is an opportunity later on for those patients to voluntarily enroll, if they choose to. And I think that if we do a good job of managing their other Medicaid benefits, they may gain confidence in health plan and decided that they want to fully participate. So it’s not as if these members are permanently gone on the Medicare side, they could come back to us later.
David H. Windley – Jefferies:  Sure. Are there – on that point, are there other steps that you can take that would change the proportion of opt-outs, change the network and things like that?
Joseph Mario Molina:  Well certainly one of the reasons that people opt-out in the Medicare side is if we don’t have their provider in the network. And it becomes more difficult on the Medicare side because these beneficiaries have multiple positions, whereas typically on the Medicaid side, the real contact with healthcare is through their primary care doctor. On the Medicare side, it’s often the specialist. And if you’ve got four or five specialists and one of them is not in our network, you may opt-out. So as time goes on, I think we will shore up the network. We do get information about who the providers are.
David H. Windley – Jefferies:  Gotcha. So last question, coming back to the MLR, there is lot of focus on the new members that are coming in or will come in over the balance of the year and impact on MLR. What about your expectations for MLR underwriting margin for the members that we’re looking at today. The decline as they mature into your plants and the medical management resources that you have in place, maybe you could talk us through proactive steps that you are taking to make sure these folks get into plans and their cost experience declines as they seize them.
Terry P. Bayer:  This is Terry. We’re executing on our model of care that we have been working on and focused on the last few years. We use a model of care whether each trying to stable patients in our Medicare D snip and we’ve extended it now to the new enrollment. The patients are all risk assessment is completed upon their entry to the program and they are dependent upon that are modeling tools and our tearing of the severity and the need for immediate intervention. Folks are getting assigned to case managers. I think we have shared with you in the past we’re focused on community connectors and care transition workers, so that we’re working with members in their homes and when they leave the hospital just as much as we’re managing them during their in-patient stage. So our full care management model which is very focused on coordinating medical, behavioral and social needs is in play on these members, not 100% on day one and that’s where our triage mechanism come in place, so that we can focused on those of most greatest need in the beginning. There is also medication therapy management programs that come, so all of the members who have a high number of medical diagnosis and prescription drugs are each in dialogue with the registered pharmacist to coordinate their drug program and that’s another way that we focused on those most greatest need in the beginning.
David H. Windley – Jefferies:  All right. Thank you.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel. Please proceed.
Thomas A. Carroll – Stifel, Nicolaus & Company:  Yes, good afternoon. I wonder if you could talk about the process that you are taking with your states to get the ACA fee totally covered and wrapped up above. I thought by this time of the year, you might have a bit more visibility on it. So is there, are you more conservative in your process make? Additional color will be helpful there?
John C. Molina:  Sure, Tom. This is John. I think one of the important things is, we’re waiting for a contract language. So while there are a couple of states Utah and Michigan, where the legislature has passed budget appropriations to cover the fee and the gross app, we’re not going to recognize that revenue until they get a contract amendment.
Thomas A. Carroll – Stifel, Nicolaus & Company:  Okay. And then just to clarify one other thing, did your prior guidance also excludes of all these spending?
John C. Molina:  Yes.
Thomas A. Carroll – Stifel, Nicolaus & Company:  So it did, your prior. I guess one when was that I’m just trying to figure out when that – when you excluded that was in your Investor Day?
John C. Molina:  That wasn’t Investor Day.
Thomas A. Carroll – Stifel, Nicolaus & Company:  Okay very good. And then is there any comment you could – you were hesitant to comment on first quarter bouts of all the spending, but may be and I appreciate the comments about telling, is there any kind of order of magnitude description you could give to us kind of first quarter into second quarter?
Joseph Mario Molina:  Yeah, this is Mario. I don’t want to quantify that. Certainly the spending in the second quarter was greater than the first quarter. We request for the drugs seem to plateus, so we think that that’s going to flat now. And, I think that part of that is an expectation if there are new drugs in the pipeline and so some positions maybe waiting for those new treatments.
Thomas A. Carroll – Stifel, Nicolaus & Company:  Okay, thanks for that.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Andy Schenker – Morgan Stanley:  Hi, it’s Andy Schenker, thanks for the question. I’m just following up on the some falsy comments there. I mean you previously highlighted obviously we got the team in Florida. You guys had acknowledged it and these Texas acknowledged that the drug wasn’t in rates. I mean how are those conversations going with Texas that reimbursement as they are specifically going forward and how your conversation and the other states potentially is going to pay retro actively and then as your expectation, it will be in rates when they renew?
Joseph Mario Molina:  As a whole lot of questions here, Andy.
John C. Molina:  Yeah, I’m not aware that any worth playing pays retro actively I think that states are talking about what they can do on a prospective basis and I think that what I would say is it’s all over the math, every state is taking a slightly different approach to this and I think they are building that into the rates for next year. As I stated in my remarks earlier a big part of our concern is not just above all of, but all the other specialty drugs and I think that the governments needs to step in here and make sure that the market is rationale. If we as a health plan with rate increase, we have to go to our regulators and get it approved. There is no such thing going on in the pharmaceutical market. Right now, pharmaceutical companies can charge whatever they want and I think there need to be rational basis for all this. If we’re going to cover all of these people, all these uninsured people, the only way to do that is by bringing down healthcare costs and we can’t do that if we see a large number of specialty drugs that sell at the medical trend. So it’s a problem not only for Medicaid companies, but it’s going to be a problem for Medicare, for the VA and for commercial plans. This is truly a national problem that’s going to affect everyone.
Andy Schenker – Morgan Stanley:  And just following-up, on your states that are off talented to fiscal year rate increases, any updates on how those rate discussions are progressing?
John C. Molina:  We generally don’t talk about how rates are progressing until we actually get rate manuals, rate sheets et cetera. But as Mario said, it does run the (indiscernible) from folks like Florida doing payment to others are going to increase the rates as certain percentage specifically for Sovaldi or our specialty drugs like Sovaldi.
Andy Schenker – Morgan Stanley:  I think and also just beyond on Sovaldi just in general how discussions are trending?
John C. Molina:  I think that with the discussions on the ACA fee and Sovaldi, those have sort of taken the forefront. So there hasn’t been a lot of discussion yet about base volume trends other than for Sovaldi et cetera. I think that now that we’re getting that populations in the MMPs getting in the Medicaid expansion, getting some data, will some of those discussions and trends to the forefront.
Andy Schenker – Morgan Stanley:  Okay, thanks.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please proceed.
Ana Gupte – Leerink Partners:  Thanks, good evening. Appreciate for taking my question. I wanted to do get some qualitative color if you can offer it at this point on the Medicaid expansion lives as far as the venue or the site that they are presenting themselves. What types of services are they seeking? And you think about the premiums of about 50% to 200% higher depending upon with state you are in. And do you think there is adequate rates in there to cover maybe the upfront our patient pharmacy emerging you know those types of costs for potentially untreated, unmanaged patients.
Joseph Mario Molina:  Ana, this is Mario. As I said before, the patients are older than our typical tenant members, but I still think it’s early for us to be making statements about the rates or the place of service or the kinds of services that they are getting. I mean for example we picked up a 100,000 members from the first quarter to the second quarter, and so I don’t feel that we have enough claims data yet to be making those kinds of statements beginning into lot of the member characteristics or healthcare patents yet, I think its developing and, we’re just going to have to watch it and maybe we can update you on that in future quarters, but right now it’s probably to assume.
Ana Gupte – Leerink Partners:  And then the hospitals I think some of them are talking about, expecting the outpatient care might trend down and it eventually transition to the inpatient setting or you has a health plan taking any step to get primary care interventions or anything of that nature, is this just going to kind of happen relatively unmanaged and they end up in the ER and so the plans don’t really have that much control over what happen?
John C. Molina:  Well, we certainly hope that this is not going to be on Managed Care, that’s sort of what we’re here for. And we are trying to manage the patients as best we can. As Terry mentioned for a lot of the patients we’re doing initial health assessments, we’ve got all kinds of care managers, John talked about the investments we made in Illinois. Across the board and this is reflected in our admin costs, we staffed up and you saw a lot of that infrastructure growth last year. So I wouldn’t say that this is just going to develop in an unmanaged fashion. We’re learning as we go. We will try to continue to improve on the method of care for these numbers, but I’m hoping that the tools we have will help us to manage them.
Ana Gupte – Leerink Partners:  And then with the States, at the point when you and the states together can make decision as to whether the rates were adequate or in excess or too little. Let’s assume they were excessive. Do you think the states will manage the margins to where they think they should be through a risk corridor, MLR floor type mechanism or on top of that there may be some rate adjustments? And if there were rate adjustments, do you think the states will use the expansion population in the federal subsidies to manage against their budgetary constraints in other areas that (indiscernible) that type of thing?
John C. Molina:  Ana, this is John. I am not sure how a state could do what you’re discussing in terms of the last point. These are federal dollars, so I don’t know how the state could use it for their budget issues. There are number of states that have caps and floors with respect to the expansion populations, but the rates for the expansion populations have to actuarially sound. And so as we get data in on demographics and utilization, we’ll have discussions with the states on what the appropriate rates are.
Joseph Mario Molina:  Yes, Ana, I think that’s an important point that John just made. In addition because of these sort of rate quarters that we have in lot of the contracts, there is some additional mitigation that you don’t see. We set aside money for claims that have been incurred but not received yet but there is also risk quarter or mitigation factors that will help us as well.
Ana Gupte – Leerink Partners:  And then we last talked I think there was something about a rate change in July, did that actually materialize and then California I might have just missed that all together but.
Joseph Mario Molina:  California is looking at rates per certain counties in July but I don’t know haven’t seen them all yet and don’t know what the impact on the expansion if any is.
Ana Gupte – Leerink Partners:  And then finally just on duals with the opt-outs that you’re seeing any sort of selection in that opt-out equation where the more acute care utilizes for the Medicare portion of this some more likely to opt-out because they get more unmanaged usage of that sort of (indiscernible).
Joseph Mario Molina:  Well, we really don’t know. What I’d say as this. The members opt-out is a voluntary choice on their part. And we don’t have a lot of insight into things like what their prior care or what your health status today at a time they are opting out. We really don’t any get an information as to why they opt-out. It’s really anecdotal information that we get. We suspect based on our experience with the dual eligible special needs plans, that a big driver of this are the providers and the provider network that we have. But I can't give you that kind of detail as to who’s opting out and why and what their patterns of utilizations are, that’s just something we don’t have any insight into.
Ana Gupte – Leerink Partners:  And if I could seek on last follow-up on that point you made, do you do any outreach to these other same people so that you know who you’re reaching out to and trying to keep and retain within the system either through the provider base or any other channel.
Joseph Mario Molina:  The moment that we are allowed to reach out to these members, we do so.
Ana Gupte – Leerink Partners:  Okay, all right. I appreciate the color.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna International Group. Please proceed.
Christian Rigg – Susquehanna International:  Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I just want to sort of kind of dumb down the guidance for the year and make sure I understand what exactly the message is. The year-to-date EPS is $0.26, the normalized for the health annualized was about $0.60 and then the taxes issue annualized about $0.24, but it gives you to roughly a $1.20 which leaves you $0.45 to $0.95 from your guidance. I guess is the message on the low end, do you think you can get there just on G&A improvement and then to get to the upper end we need to see the MLRs come down a bit?
Joseph Mario Molina:  This is John. I hate to make it that (indiscernible). As we’ve discussed, there is a lot of moving parts. But I think if you want to characterize it that way, I would think that just bringing the G&A down, that would get us beyond the low end.
Christian Rigg – Susquehanna International:  Okay. And then, the DCP remained at an elevated level here from the first quarter and I guess I’m just trying to get a sense for what’s the right level to think about as we move into the back half of the year or maybe just a little bit longer term.
Joseph W. White:  Joe speaking. Are you asking about what’s the right level for DCP is?
Christian Rigg – Susquehanna International:  Yes, I mean it looks like there is some conservatism baked into that and you’re not alone in the industry at this point, but I’m just trying to figure out where you think that shakes out overtime.
Joseph Mario Molina:  We don’t put a lot of stock in DCP, but I think you can expect it come down a day or two as the population mature, we work through our client backlogs and we get more confidentially where we are in terms about cost estimation.
Christian Rigg – Susquehanna International:  Okay. And then my last question or questions, I guess the health insurance fee and the remuneration for that, is that still a split like an (indiscernible) split between the states and the fed’s picking up most of that on behalf of the states?
Joseph Mario Molina:  It is a split. Part of it is contributed by the state, part of it is contributed by the feds.
Christian Rigg – Susquehanna International:  Right and then I mean this is kind of crazy, but then when you think about Texas and sort of where they are cortically, big rate of governor who seems to low everything about the ACA, is there any political element in your mind with regard to them not agreeing, you have to remunerate that because they may just say, hey we don’t care, it’s a federal tax and we don’t want any part of it.
Joseph Mario Molina:  Well, what I would say about that is, that we have a very good relationship with the Health and Human Services Commission. And we have dialogue with them as do the other health plans. I would not describe a lot of political mode of do anything at this point.
Christian Rigg – Susquehanna International:  Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Operator:  And our final question comes from the line of Brian Wright with Sterne Agee. Please proceed.
Brian Wright – Sterne Agee:  Thanks, and I apologize I may have missed this. But could you talk a little bit about the sequential move in Michigan on the MLR to just give us some understanding to what happen there?
Joseph W. White:  Hey, Brian, it’s Joe speaking. That’s one of those mechanical developments in terms of how 12/31 changed, if that combined and again the numbers are small and consolidated but they are relative to some revenue adjustments on Medicare there.
Brian Wright – Sterne Agee:  Okay.
Joseph W. White:  Not significant enough to move the needle consolidated but they can impact on the health plan.
Brian Wright – Sterne Agee:  Okay, thank you.
Operator:  Dr. Molina, there are no further questions at this time. I’ll turn the call back over to you.
J. Mario Molina:  Well, thank you all for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you with our next quarter results.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today’s conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Thank you and have a great day.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Molina Healthcare First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, Thursday, May 1, 2014. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Juan José Orellana, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan Jose Orellana: Thank you, George. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare's financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2014.

Joseph Mario Molina: Thank you, Juan José. Hello, everyone. And as always, thank you for your interest in Molina Healthcare. As you review our financial results for the quarter, you'll see that our performance reflects actions that we talked about at our Investor Day in February. We are experiencing considerable revenue and enrollment growth. We are transforming from an acute care company to a chronic care company. We are diversifying by winning new contracts and entering new states. We are aligning our resources and skills to gain greater administrative leverage, and we continue to build on our framework for dramatic expansion in 2014 and beyond. For the quarter, we delivered adjusted net income per diluted share from continuing operations of $0.64. Our operating results were strong, despite the headwinds we communicated at our Investor Day. Of considerable interest in the investors during the first quarter was the timing difference between expense and revenue recognition associated with the reimbursement of the health insurance fees. As expected, the company had not secured agreements with all of our states prior to the quarter end. And as a result, only recognized reimbursement and tax effect in Florida, Illinois, Ohio, Washington and Wisconsin. Nevertheless, we remain optimistic that agreements with our remaining states will be resolved prior to the close of 2014. While much has happened during the first quarter in both our industry and our business, not much has actually changed from what we reported at the Investor Day. So let me focus on some of the things that have changed. Earlier this month, CMS reported that between October and February, nearly 12 million people have been determined eligible for Medicaid and CHIP, but that only 3 million people have actually enrolled in these programs during the same period. The increase in Medicaid enrollment across the country is encouraging, but the gap between those deemed eligible and those that are enrolled continues to point to the systemwide hurdles and resource constraints related to processing applications for millions of individuals. However, it's important to note that although the March 31 deadline for marketplace has passed, under the Medicaid program, people can apply for coverage at any time. This will enable us to continue to grow as the year goes by and as enrollment barriers are overcome. The surge in Medicaid applications during the open-enrollment period still contributed to a considerable enrollment gain to Molina during the first quarter. Specifically, our health plans and states participating in Medicaid Expansion added 133,000 new Medicaid expansion lives, accounting for 60% of our sequential enrollment growth. As a reminder, Medicaid expansion lives are reimbursed at higher per-member per-month premiums. To put these premiums in perspective, our new expansion lives are expected to generate approximately $1 billion in annualized revenue. This is almost the same amount of premium generated by our Ohio health plan in 2013. Enrollment due to the so-called woodwork effect at our health plans has not yet had a material impact on our results, but we anticipate that we could see higher enrollment related to it in the upcoming months. Also contributing to enrollment growth during the quarter was our expansion and diversification efforts in South Carolina. Effective January 1, 2014, we began serving members in all 46 counties under the state's new full risk Medicaid managed care program. At the end of the first quarter, we had membership of approximately 126,000 members, distinguishing Molina as the second-largest Medicaid health plan in South Carolina. Our expansion into South Carolina demonstrates that there are still start up and acquisition opportunities in states where we do not currently operate. For many years, we've been building for the opportunities associated with the dual eligibles that are now within sight. While, technically, a second quarter event, we are pleased to report that we've already enrolled nearly 9,000 fully integrated dual eligible members across California, Illinois and Ohio. Fully integrated duals are individuals for whom we receive premiums from both Medicaid and Medicare. California has generated nearly 60% of our initial dual eligibles enrollment. Voluntary enrollment for the demonstration program in California called CAL-Medi-Connect, started April 1 in 3 out of the 4 counties, where we were selected to participate: Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego. Voluntary enrollment in Los Angeles County is slated to begin in June 1. Our corporate and field teams are working diligently to complete health risk assessment calls, and call volumes are being handled, and we are meeting all compliant standards. The passive enrollment process for Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego begins today, May 1, and on July 1 for Riverside -- I'm sorry, for Los Angeles County. Dual eligibles are elderly or disabled and have chronic illness, or even multiple chronic illnesses, including mental illness and are, more likely, because of their low income, to remain continuously eligible for government programs. The demographic and health care characteristics of the dual eligible members requires additional outreach and individual care plans, making Molina exceptionally well suited to address the needs of this population. Our focus has always been to take care of those most in need of health care and least able to afford it. We're excited that California remains on track in terms of the implementation of its duals demonstration program. However, a delay has emerged in Michigan, where you may recall, we were chosen to participate in the dual eligible demonstration in 2 counties, Wayne and Macomb, which have a combined dual eligible population of approximately 75,000 individuals. Last month, Michigan finalized its memorandum of understanding with CMS, which included a delay in implementation timeline. The demonstration will now begin no earlier than January 1, 2015, and will continue through December 31, 2017. In the 2 counties in which we operate, Wayne and Macomb, the opt-in enrollment period will begin no earlier than March 1, 2015, with enrollments effective May 1, 2015. In Texas, we received notice from the Texas Health and Human Services Commission that the duals implementation has been delayed to March 1, 2015. In South Carolina, the duals eligible demonstration was originally slated for implementation in July 2014 and has now been delayed by the state to January 1, 2015. Finally, there have been various headlines in the news regarding the new Hepatitis C treatment drug, Sovaldi, and how states will pay for this extremely expensive therapy. For Molina, coverage of the cost of this new hepatitis treatment is included in our first quarter results. However, we anticipate an increase of cases, where the new Hepatitis C treatments are requested, as new all-oral therapies, in addition to Sovaldi are being approved by the FDA later this year, so we're keeping a close eye on this situation. We're still awaiting guidance for many of our states on how Sovaldi is going to be handled and how they are going to pay for it. We continue to believe that the cost of Sovaldi are not included in the rates we received and remain in discussion with states on how we will be reimbursed for these costs. In the meantime, in the relevant states, we are rigorously applying our clinical guidelines to request for treatment and, so far, the number of applicable cases has been low. However, we remain extremely concerned about the high cost of Sovaldi and other new Hepatitis C treatments and how they will affect state Medicaid budgets. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John.
John C. Molina: Thank you, Mario, and hello, everyone. As Mario highlighted earlier, we reported adjusted earnings of $0.64 per diluted share; and on a GAAP basis, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $0.10. As a reminder, we introduced our methodology for the adjusted net income per diluted share calculation at our Investor Day last February. These adjustments add back non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and noncash interest expense. We believe that these adjustments best reflect our financial performance. We're pleased with our first quarter results which have developed as much as we anticipated they would when we spoke to you last in New York in February. We have been speaking for some time about the dramatic changes that would come our way in 2014. These changes make meaningful comparisons difficult to our results of a year ago or even to the previous quarter. We outlined many of the items affecting year-over-year comparability in today's press release for your reference, so rather than revisiting the differences, let me highlight some of the accomplishments achieved this quarter. Premium revenue grew by 21%, almost $350 million from what we reported for the fourth quarter of 2013, only 12 weeks ago. At 88.7% of premium revenue, Medical care costs were flat compared to last quarter, generating over $37 million more in medical margin than we reported a year -- a quarter ago. General and administrative expense fell from 11% of revenue in the fourth quarter to only 9.1% of revenue 90 days later. So with that as background, let me dive into the details. First, let's take the revenue for this quarter. The major drivers of the $350 million increase over the fourth quarter of last year were: Medicaid Expansion in California, New Mexico and Washington, which added $200 million in revenue in the first quarter; the start up of our South Carolina health plan, which added another $96 million to revenue; increased long-term care membership in Florida, which added $28 million to revenue over the fourth quarter; and the rollout of Centennial Care in New Mexico, which increased our revenue for the quarter by $27 million. This is separate from the increased revenue related to Medicaid expansion. Now moving onto medical costs. We are pleased that the medical care ratio at 88.7% was unchanged from the fourth quarter of last year. MCR was flat even though we added new products and services, which tend to exhibit higher initial medical costs due to factors such as pent-up demand. The medical care ratio for our Medicaid expansion members was about 88% on a consolidated basis. We did record a high MCR, or 94%, for our South Carolina health plan. High medical care ratios are typical for start-up health plans, when members are transitioning from fee-for-service to managed care. For both Medicaid expansion and South Carolina, it's still too early to assess what the steady-state medical care ratio will be. Again, we are happy to see a consolidated MCR unchanged from the fourth quarter. We often see higher medical costs in the first quarter of the year compared to other quarters. We are also pleased to note that we have started to experience the administrative cost leverage we have talked about at our last Investor Days. This was a big story for us this quarter. General and administrative expenses were 9.1% of revenue for the first quarter of 2014, a decrease from 11% in the fourth quarter of 2013. The administrative ratio improved, even though approximately $20 million, or $0.19 per diluted share in G&A costs were spent during the first quarter, with no related revenue. As the new programs are implemented, and their associated revenue finally starts hitting our books, we expect to gain greater administrative leverage, resulting in an even lower administrative expense ratio. Our full year guidance for 2014 anticipates that our administrative expense ratio will continue to decline to 7.5% for the fourth quarter of 2014. There are 3 other items that require special mention this quarter: First, the ACA health insurer fee. As of today, we have signed contracts calling for the reimbursement of the fee and its related tax effects with Florida, Ohio, Illinois, Washington and Wisconsin. This means that we have reached agreement for full reimbursement of the fee for approximately 50% of our Medicaid revenue. We remain optimistic that we will reach agreements for reimbursement with all of our states before the end of 2014. But for right now, for the first quarter of 2014, we have recognized the impact of the entire fee and its related tax effects as an expense, but we have recognized only half of the related Medicaid revenue that we expect to receive. This means that the first quarter revenue and pretax income is about $16 million, or $0.15 per diluted share less than it would have been had we recognized full state reimbursement of the health insurer fee. Bear in mind that the fee in any related revenue we recognize is prorated evenly across the year. Next, we were unable to recognize about $6 million, or about $0.06 per diluted share of quality-related revenue at our Texas health plan this quarter. We spoke about this in February. The state of Texas has changed some of its measurements used for the quality-related revenue. Since we don't have prior history for these new measurements, it is difficult to estimate current year progress towards these goals, this early in the year. Thus, we have not recognized quality revenue for these new metrics as of yet. We believe that we should be able to recognize most of this revenue later in the year. Lastly, our effective tax rate. As you no doubt can see from our financial results, the nondeductibility of the ACA health insurer fee results in a much higher tax rate this year. We have recorded an effective tax rate of about 54% for this quarter. As hard as it is to compare the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year, it is even more difficult to compare our results this quarter with the first quarter of 2013, given the significant changes to our business. All of the caveats I mentioned regarding the absence of reimbursement, a part of the health insurer fee, the revenue gross up required due to the nondeductibility of that fee and the unrecognized Texas quality revenue still apply to the first quarter of this year. Lastly, we have a very different effective tax rate between the first quarter of 2014 and 2013 due to the nondeductibility of the health insurer fee. Again, you will need to interpret our comparative financial performances yourselves, should you want to take -- undertake such an analysis. But I encourage you to consider all the points that I have made as you do so. We feel that year-over-year comparisons are not the most valuable way to measure our progress towards our defined goals. Operating cash flow was strong at $210 million for the quarter. We added a significant amount of premium and correspondingly, we've strengthened our reserves as evidenced by an increase in days in claims payable. Days in claims payable increased to 46 from 43 at the end of the 2013. As of March 31, 2014, the company had cash and investments of around $1.9 billion, including approximately $340 million at the parent company. We are reaffirming guidance for 2014 of adjusted net income per diluted share in the range of $4.00 to $4.50 and net income per diluted share on a GAAP basis in the range of $1.65 to $2.15. We had a strong quarter. But as you know from following us over the years, it is not our practice to fine tune guidance on a quarterly basis, particularly when we provided guidance just 12 weeks ago. Mario talked about delays and the implementation of the duals programs in Michigan, South Carolina and Texas. It is important to note that these delays have a minimal effect on 2014 guidance and no material effect to our long-term revenue growth target of $12.5 billion. While we are keeping our guidance range unchanged, because of our positive Q1 results, we now have a corresponding bias towards the higher end of fiscal year 2014 EPS guidance range. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sarah James from Wedbush.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: As some of your dual contracts have started to come online, has there been any updates or developments, any understanding of opt-out likelihood? Your assumptions seem to be a little bit more conservative than some of your peers?
Joseph Mario Molina: This is Mario. We think it's a little too early to start commenting on the opt-out rates. Remember, that these patients have the ability to opt out any time throughout the course of the program. And for our guidance, we assumed a 50% opt-out rate.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay. You mentioned benefiting some -- Sovaldi not being on the preferred drug list in some markets in first quarter, which is similar to comments that your peers have made, but some states have moved it onto the PDL for April while others, like Texas, may not do so until the third quarter. So I was wondering if you could help us understand how much of your book was exposed to that drug cost in the first quarter versus how you think about it being exposed in the second quarter, given the recent PDL update?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, this is Mario again. I think that we will see more exposure going forward. I think Gilead reported that only 7% of the sales in the first quarter were from Medicaid, although they didn't break out how much of the sales on the HMO side were to Medicaid patients covered by health plans. But I do think we will see this grow as the year unfolds. At the same token, when we first started talking about this at the beginning of the year, most states didn't recognize the problem. I think now it's widely recognized by state Medicaid directors that this is an issue, and I think there's growing acknowledgment by state Medicaid programs that the rates that we initially received did not include the cost of this new drug. So the story is evolving, and I think that perhaps next quarter, we'll be able to tell you a little bit more about utilization, but also a little bit more about what the state Medicaid programs are doing to appropriately reimburse us for costs.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joshua Raskin with Barclays.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: My question is on the Medicaid expansion population. I know it's early in terms of trends, and it sounds like you guys were accruing, I guess, you said at 88% MLRs. When do you think you'll have a better handle as to what the claims looks like? I'm assuming you've got some of the January claims processed and maybe a lot of the pharmacy claims, et cetera? And then the second part to the question is where are these members getting enrolled? Are the states aware of who these individuals are and they're auto assigning them? Or a lot of these people are getting signed up through utilization of the health care system i.e. hospital providers signing them up when they have some sort of acute episodes.
John C. Molina: Josh, this is John. With respect to your -- the first part of your question. I think we'll have a much better handle by the end of the second quarter in terms of what the true utilization patterns are going to be. And as far as how folks are singing up, we don't have a lot of visibility into that. If they do identify a provider and they communicate that to the state and we get that information, then we can match them up. But I don't know at this point how many do and how many of them are just being auto assigned.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I guess, if you look at your January enrollment, for example, in some of the states where you've seen some robust growth there, are you able to see some sort of episode or some sort of cost usage early in their assignment of health plans? Or was there a January 1 sort of bucket that came through, so it looks like these are more evenly distributed across the population?
John C. Molina: We didn't notice any particular pattern of how people were enrolled, Josh, sorry.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. All right, no problem. Just one second question, just on the exchange, I know it's only 8,000 lives for you. Is that majority in California? And then, any thoughts on where those individuals are coming on versus where you guys priced for them?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, the state that has the largest enrollment right now is California, so it is the -- where the majority of -- probably, half the 2/3 are coming out of California. What was the second part of your question, Josh?
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: In terms of cost trends or any early signs of the age or demographics, how they're lining up relative to what your expectations were?
Joseph Mario Molina: Yes. Actually, the demographics are very similar to what we expected when we made our projections, so we're pleased about that. A little over half of them are coming on in the Silver plan. 91% of them are receiving some sort of government subsidy, so it's all very consistent with what we expected. In terms of the medical costs, I think it's probably still too early to say, but the pharmacy costs seem to be tracking within expectations.
Operator: Our next question comes from Justin Lake with JPMorgan.
Michael A. Newshel - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: It's actually Mike Newshel in for Justin. So I kind of like to go back to Hep C cost. If you can, is it possible to -- can you give us a number of patients or the dollar spending for the quarter? And sort of embedded within -- embedded in guidance, do you have -- there's something embedded in there for the full year? Or you're just assuming that if it does accelerate that the states are going to come back and cover for you?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, we're not going to break out the number of prescriptions or utilizing patients. We typically don't get into that kind of granular detail on our medical costs, so we're not going to do it here either. I don't believe that it was built into our guidance, because, we, frankly, did not anticipate this based on the rates that we were given from the state. So we see this as something outside of guidance. We are negotiating probably, right now, with about half the states over adjustments to payments whether it be through carve outs or a pass through or some of the mechanism or revisiting this in the rates.
Michael A. Newshel - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. One more question on the ramp up of -- or, actually, the ramp down of the administrative expense ratio over the course of the year. You updated the fourth quarter. Any update you can give for the second and third quarter in terms of the ramp down given the delays in duals launches?
John C. Molina: Sure. This is John. If you go back to our Investor Day slide presentation, there was a slide that had quarterly estimate for what we thought the MN expense ratio would be. I don't, off the top of my head, know what it is for Q2 and Q3. But if you want to go back to the slide, you should be able to find it.
Michael A. Newshel - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I know, and it's still valid?
Joseph W. White: Yes, that's correct. It's Joe speaking. We don't think the sliding of those duals program is going to affect guidance one way or the other.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Rigg with the Susquehanna International Group.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Just to come back to the exchange population again. I know you get paid slightly different rates, because there's, obviously, some acuity differences, but more generally, and we've heard some of the hospital guys talk about substantial declines in their uninsured visits, primarily, in the expansion states. And, I guess, can you give us a sense for whether you've seen a materially higher level of inpatient or hospital outpatient utilization among the newly enrolled by the expansion versus traditional populations?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, we -- are you talking about the expansion population or the exchange population? Because it sounds like you're mixing the 2.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Yes, I meant to say the Medicaid expansion population, so the 133,000 that you guys highlighted.
Joseph W. White: Yes. It's Joe's speaking. Frankly, those claims have been slow to come in. And we really don't -- we just don't have a read on their -- the medical claims development there, how it breaks down between inpatient and outpatient. Again, we're confident it's in that high 80s MCR, but we just haven't had a huge amount of claims development.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And then, just on the build and the claims inventory in the balance sheet. Is that just due to your expected ramp in growth? Or is there something else going on there?
Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking again, that's tied to our growth, nothing unusual in claims process or anything.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just going back to the exchange this year, obviously, about 8,000 lives in the first quarter. May I ask what are you guys expecting now for the year? Is it still around the 15,000 point, or after April, this is going to vary a little bit from that?
John C. Molina: This is John. We did see a pick up in enrollment towards the end of March, early April, so that's going to grow. I don't know, it's going to get much beyond the 15,000 that we're talking about.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So switching, specifically to Washington there, I saw a little bit of an increase in the MCR, obviously, an expansion state there, was that part of the driver of the increase? Or share anything else was highlighting in Washington, specifically?
Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking yes, it's expansion, which is running [indiscernible] again of what we expect is running a little bit about what we traditionally run for the other populations in Washington. And I think we talked to the end of last year about a little bit of rate pressure in Washington, which is carried over into this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink.
Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: So just following up on the Medicaid Expansion and the claims experience that you saw this quarter. You talked about the 1Q being -- coming in favorable relative to expectations. How much of that is due to any kind of weather and/or the flu impact? And on the Medicaid Expansion, you said you haven't seen a lot of claims, but are you trying to steer the patients more to your point about being a chronic care company to the primary care physician when they come on board? Or will they just stand up in the ER? And how long does the claim cycle take for you to start seeing something? Might we see something that may have already happened in 1Q?
Joseph Mario Molina: There's a bunch of questions in there. Let me see if I can hit them all. In terms of our expectations in whether a favorable pickup in Q1 because of -- I think what we said was we're coming at our expectation, which was the high 80s, like 88%. So I'm not sure if there was any favorability there. In terms of where are we expecting them to get care, all of the patients that we get, we do try to steer towards the primary care doctor as opposed to the ER. These folks may traditionally have used the ER as their primary care site, but that's really not much different than any time we switch from a fee-for-service in the managed-care environment. So we do try to connect them with their PCP. We do welcome calls, make sure they know who their primary care doctor is and encourage them to go in for that visit. And last, again, it's just really too early to tell, since we don't have a lot of claims experience yet to know what the utilization pattern is, but I don't think we're seeing anything unusual.
Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: Okay, yes, got it. It's very early in the day. And I just wanted to follow-up, understanding, again, it's very early on the duals side. You've enrolled some members, and you're doing the health risk assessments, I'm just trying to triangulate to your point around, we should be looking at adjusted income. And as you're seeing some of its early experiences and risk profiles with duals and Medicaid expansion and after you get your revenue, that you're expecting on board, what might we see as normalized MLRs and your administrative cost ratio and margin? What would be your best guess going forward compared to where you are today?
Joseph Mario Molina: Sure, I think that for the year, we're estimating medical care ratio of somewhere between 88% and 90% off the top of my head. I'm going back to guidance. And the admin cost, we're expecting will continue to decline throughout the year. We should have, as we said, fourth quarter about 7.5%. And I think on average, about 8% for the year. 89%...
Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: I was thinking more about your $12.5 billion kind of long-term targets, and so it shouldn't go beyond your one-time story in '14. We all understand it's a transition here?
Joseph Mario Molina: True. And what we've said consistently is we should exit 2015. We're on a $12.5 billion run rate, and our net income goal is 2%, and that's on a GAAP basis, so we'll be revisiting that in the next Investor Day to translate that into an adjusted earnings margin. But our story is fairly consistent in terms of what we expect, in terms of the margin and the revenue goals.
Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: So still 2%, okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Carter with Crédit Suisse.
Chris Carter: I guess, just first question. Can you just talk about if you experienced any benefit in the quarter from weather or more benign flu season?
John C. Molina: This is John. I think the flu season was about the same as it was last year. So I don't know -- certainly better than when we had H1N1 in 2009, but I don't know if I would say it's a benefit.
Joseph Mario Molina: In terms of the weather, this is Mario, a lot of that weather affected more the eastern part of the country. If you look, a large part of our membership is in places like California and Washington. I don't think the weather had any impact on us.
Chris Carter: Okay. And then just curious, I know that the California MLR looked pretty good. I'm curious how that compared to the 3.25% target margin in the settlement agreement? And maybe if you had a swing positive or negative into that settlement account?
John C. Molina: This is John. I think if you look in our Q, which is also filed today, we realized about a $5 million pickup from the settlement agreement.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.
Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: First question, just looks like the cost of services ratio improved by around 250 bps sequentially. were there any factors that drove the improvement in particular? And is this a good run rate for the rest of the year? That would seem to be trending a bit better than I was expecting there.
Joseph W. White: This is Joe speaking. We've seen a pretty good quarter with MMS in first quarter of this year. It's a couple of things. There has been some lift, which we expect to continue from more claimed volume tied to Medicaid expansion. There were also some revenue recognition related to projects being completed and onetime payments from the state. I say if you can look at that, the improvement is 50-50 split between those two. So some of that improvement will carry forward.
Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. Then just on the Texas MLR, was up around 300 bps sequentially. Was that all just not being able to recognize the quality revenues yet? Or were there any other factors that drove the MLR up a bit sequentially?
Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking again. The big issue there in terms of that, sequentially, from fourth quarter is the at-risk quality revenue not recognized.
Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. Then just last question, I guess, just swinging back to Sovaldi here. Interested just how much does the determinations differ in the States, where the drug is on the PDL as compared to those that aren't. It was just interesting looking at the Florida Medicaid drug utilization report for the first quarter. It showed that Sovaldi for Florida Medicaid was the most costly drug in the program, even though they didn't even put it to the PDL till the end of the quarter. So just thought it was interesting that we're already seeing that type of spend, even in a state where it wasn't in the PDL. So just interested in how -- the variability that occurs between states with it on the PDL as compared to those that are not.
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, we know that the state of Florida that they expect that -- Sovaldi to double their cost this year for the treatment of Hepatitis C, so I think, at least, in that status, it's going to be significant. I can't give you data on a state-by-state basis. And, of course, we only have limited exposure, because we're only looking at what our patients are experiencing, not what the entire state is doing.
Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Mario, just on Florida, is there any update you know of as to where the discussion stand? Because I think the budget was basically getting wrapped up, right? So just wondering whether -- how the discussion on getting a rate adjustment filtered into that sort of last-minute discussions going on?
Joseph Mario Molina: I think there's a lot of activity even yesterday and today on that. And I would say that it's a positive sign that the states are recognizing that this is an incremental cost. And I think most states are now recognizing that it was not built into the rates.
Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So you feel positive they're going to make an adjustment then, for the rates there?
Joseph Mario Molina: I think we're going to see some adjustments. Like everything else though, is it appropriate, is it enough? Those are the kinds of things we always discuss with the states when they makes changes in the rates?
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.
Stephen Baxter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: This is Steve Baxter on for Kevin. I wanted to come back to the balance sheet. It looks like the claims in the inventory and the claims in inventory per member roughly doubled year-over-year. I was wondering if you could provide some color on what's driving the increase? And whether you expect that to clear out, or whether that might be a more stable kind of inventory level to think about going forward?
Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking. The increase in inventory, I think, a better metric to look at would be to compare it to fourth quarter of last year, but it's certainly and predominantly enrollment-driven.
Stephen Baxter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, well, I see that the claims per member were about 0.08 last year in the fourth quarter and now it looks like they're 0.013 -- or 0.13, so it seems like a pretty dramatic increase.
Joseph W. White: Well, you're always going to have with -- as good a job, frankly, as we think we do in terms of claims payment, when new populations come on, you always tend to have a buildup, with peak, third, fourth month, fifth month of enrollment. And it just speaks to the time it takes for that. There's claims that show up in inventory and then to work through the backlog. It takes a while maneuvering people on for doctors to get the claims and -- based on where the member belongs.
Joseph Mario Molina: And this also underscores why the days in claims payable was up.
Stephen Baxter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. No, that makes sense. I appreciate the color. And then just one follow up on the $5 million you recognized from the risk share restaurant agreement. Was that on the duals site of enrollment or in the Medicaid side?
Joseph W. White: It was on the Medicaid side.
Joseph Mario Molina: No duals at first quarter in California.
Stephen Baxter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay then. So you're not really booking the duals at very high MLR then? Somewhere in the low 90s, like you had kind of given a guidance?
John C. Molina: We haven't got any duals in the revenue side for the first quarter, so we will book those, as they start to come in Q2.
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Can you tell us a little bit more about the woodwork effect? I know you haven't seen much of it yet, but you talked about potentially seeing it going forward? Do you think that it's just held up sort of in process as we're moving through some of these people who've been identified as perhaps eligible for Medicaid that just haven't signed up yet? Is it a matter of going out and targeting these people from you guys? Or exactly, what do you think is going on there? And when do you think that will start to show up in your numbers?
Terry P. Bayer: This is Terry. It varies by state, but you've seen in the press that the high number of folks who've been found eligible but still had not really made it into the roles. Remember, there's a process, by which people get on Medicaid, and it can take months. It varies sometimes [indiscernible] at the county level. There have been issues with some of the state processing systems. So in most cases, we had seen delays in that. And we expect it to be coming in, as people work their way through that process.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And is that factored into your guidance as you sort of -- that enrollment process, and you see them for those people coming in? Do you have sort of factored in, in the last couple of quarters here showing up?
Joseph Mario Molina: Yes, we do. I think we went over that -- quantified that at the Investor Day.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then just on the Texas incentive fee is that in guidance at this point, the $0.06?
Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking, yes. We expect to realize most of that. I mean, recognize most of that by the end of the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Windley from Jefferies.
David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Quick question on your MLR accrual on expansion lives. I want to make sure I understand. So I've heard you say 88% to 90%, or that range a couple of times. I've also heard you say that you haven't seen a lot of claims for them. So can you help me again to understand your comfort level with that high 80s level, if I have that right? And what allowances you're making for the low visibility relative to claims volume?
Joseph W. White: This is Joe speaking. Obviously, when we have situations with light claims receipts, we tend to err a little bit to the side of being cautious. What we do, clearly, have though with expansion lives at this stage is we have very good pharmacy data, of course. And that is suggesting that we're tracking to where the lives are priced at by the state, or perhaps a little better than that. So I think it's fair to say we feel pretty good about that number. Pharmacy date is a pretty good indication of where it's going to come in, in time.
David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: And taking that down to operating and pretax. What are your -- what are the company's expectations for contribution margin on these lives? What's in guidance, I guess, what I mean by that?
John C. Molina: This is John. In guidance, we've got -- it varies a little bit by state, but 88% is about the average. If you go back to our Investor Day slide, we sort of broke it down, what we thought Medicaid Expansion will be on a state-by-state basis. I don't know that the admin costs vary much, so I'd use an average admin cost. And that's how you can get to a margin.
Joseph Mario Molina: And if you look towards the MD&A discussion in our 10-Q, you see where we talked a little bit about the blended premium rates for the different population routes. So you can build it from that, I think.
Operator: Our last question comes from Tom Carroll with Stifel.
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Question for you on kind of the variation in the headwinds that you told us about -- at your Investor Day a couple of months ago versus the actual results. And if I'm adding it up correctly, it looks like you highlighted kind of $0.92 a share in headwinds, and it looks like those are only turning out to be about $0.40 a share. So big favorable swing. Any 1 or 2 items you could highlight for us that would reconcile that sizable difference from 2 months ago?
Joseph W. White: Sure, it's Joe speaking. When we called those out in New York, the intent was to present in each of those areas, the most extreme negative circumstances that could arise from those areas. So, obviously, had all of those played out, I think Slide 57 on our investor deck, had all those played out as negative, we would have had a disastrous quarter. So I think the way to look at it is those were each worse case and what could develop. That's not -- we don't set guidance, so assuming every worse case is going to develop. So that's the best I could express that.
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Okay, okay, very good. It sounds like a lot of conservatism built into those numbers, which were worst-case scenarios.
Joseph W. White: And if you had anybody worked those into their numbers, they would've had a much lower number than how consensus work out for this quarter.
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: And then I missed it. Did you mention the Sovaldi spend in first quarter? I'd love to know that number if you could provide it to us.
Joseph Mario Molina: No, Tom. We didn't, and we're not disclosing it. We typically don't break out medical cost to that granular degree, so we're not going to do that now.
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: It's just kind of an unusual characteristic this quarter, so just sticking to your guns on that?
Joseph Mario Molina: That's right.
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then one last question. I'm pretty sure you guys bid down in Puerto Rico. I wondered if you could give us an update on kind of where that stands? It seems like sources and information's kind of gone radio silent. Is there an update you can give us?
John C. Molina: No, this is John, no. Until something definitive happens, we're not going to comment.
Joseph Mario Molina: All right, well, thank you, everyone. We appreciate you listening in on this quarter's call, and we'll be back with you in a few months to go over the second quarter.

Mario Molina: Thank you, Juan José. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining our discussion. First, I want to say that John and I will be brief in our remarks today. We will have a full afternoon with many of you at Thursday’s Investor Day in New York City. There is too much happening at Molina to cover in a single phone call. So today we will focus briefly on 2013. On Thursday, we will share our thoughts on 2014 and beyond. I look forward to seeing you there. For Molina Healthcare 2013 was another successful year of continuity, growth and opportunity. The results that we are reporting today conclude a year in which we strengthened the foundation of our existing business, expanded into new markets, added new products and prepared for the opportunities in front of us. Profitability of its core operation is essential to any business. This is why we've made such great efforts to stabilize medical costs in 2013. During 2013, I'm pleased to report that eight of our nine legacy health plans reported increases in medical margin. 2013 was also a year of growth. Our total revenues reached $6.6 billion, a record for our company. We expanded our national footprint by entering two additional key states, Illinois and South Carolina. Our entry to Illinois came by way of startup, while South Carolina was achieved through an acquisition. In our existing states we nearly doubled the size of the New Mexico health plan by assuming another health plan’s Medicaid contract. We were awarded a long-term care contract in Florida, we expanded statewide in Ohio and we secured five dual eligible contracts more than any other health plan in the country. In addition, last week, the California Health and Human Services Agency notified us that Molina Healthcare will be offered a direct contract in Los Angeles County for the Duals Demonstration pilot. This is an exciting development, as it represents a new service area to complement our participation in Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties for the Duals Demonstration pilots. We accomplished all of this, while preparing our organization for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act requiring us to scale and build the infrastructure required to accommodate Medicaid expansion and the new marketplace products. I’d like to take a moment to thank all of our employees for their hard work and their contributions during 2013 in transforming our collective aspirations into reality. Of course, all of these accomplishments have not come easily and much work remains to be done. Pressure on premium rates, increased spending on administration in preparation for the new enrollment and temporary delays in some programs continued to create a challenge for anyone involved in the Medicaid business. Since 1981 when my father founded this company, our success has been rooted in our ability to respond to and overcome the challenges in our industry, never losing the focus on serving those most in need and least able to afford care. Today we arrange care for over 2.1 million persons in 11 states, building upon our leadership in serving the underserved, we believe the coming years will take us much, much further. We're very excited about the future. And now, I’d like to turn the call over to John.
John Molina: Thank you, Mario, and hello, everyone. As Mario noted, we accomplished a lot this year even while we were establishing a solid foundation for our future growth. Today we reported full year earnings of $0.96 per diluted share on a GAAP basis or $3.13 per diluted share on an adjusted basis, a substantial improvement over the earnings of $0.27 per diluted share on a GAAP basis or a $1.72 per diluted share on adjusted basis reported for the comparable period for 2012. These results are consistent with our preannouncement on January 22nd. Total revenues grew by 11% when compared to 2012 reaching a record $6.6 billion. The revenue growth was driven primarily by increased enrollment and to a lesser extent through an increase in revenue per member per month. Enrollment in 2013 grew to 1.9 million increasing by approximately 134,000 members when compared to 2012. The enrollment gains came primarily from four states, California, Ohio, New Mexico and Wisconsin. In California and Ohio, we added new members as we expanded into new service areas. In New Mexico as Mario discussed, we assume the membership associated with another Health Plans Medicaid contract and in Wisconsin, we benefited from the exit of a local competitor. Growth in our aged, blind and disabled enrollment, coupled with growth in our Medicare Advantage plans, both of which come with higher premiums contributed to our growth in revenue per member per month. While clearly a first quarter 2014 event and the only piece of news associated with 2014 that we will discuss this afternoon, our consolidated enrollment in January grew to 2.1 million members, an increase of nearly 200,000 members in just one month. A large part of that enrollment gain is the result of our South Carolina health plan, which started serving members on January 1st. The remainder is new enrollment resulting from the expansion of the Medicaid program. The additional revenue associated with these members will help us leverage the administrative infrastructure we’ve been investing in. As Mario noted, we made substantial improvements to the margins of our base business in 2013. Other than in Illinois where operations commenced in September of 2013, medical margins improved in eight of our nine health plans last year. Consolidated medical margin increased by approximately 45% year-over-year. Consistent with the increase in medical margin, our medical care ratio declined to 87.1% in 2013, compared with 90% for the full year of 2012. As we have discussed before, the improvement in medical margins was partially offset by higher general and administrative expense. The need to prepare for enrollment growth associated with our South Carolina and New Mexico acquisitions, Florida and New Mexico long-term care programs, Medicaid expansion in six states, Duals Demonstration in five states and the entry into the marketplace in nine states required us to spend about $135 million during 2013 in G&A expenses, above and beyond G&A expenses associated with our base business. There was very little revenue in 2013 to offset this additional G&A expense. As a result of this necessary growth in expenses, general and administrative expenses grew to 10.1% of total revenue in 2013 from 8.8% in 2012. This higher G&A spend was the main reason why we guided to a breakeven fourth quarter when we announced third quarter results at the end of October. Absent the unfavorable premium adjustment in Washington that Mario announced at our appearance at the J.P. Morgan Conference on January 13th, fourth quarter results came in as we told you they would. As of December 31, 2013, the company had cash and investments of around $1.7 billion, including approximately $365 million at the parent. If you recall in February of 2013, we raised $550 million by issuing convertible debt. As we’ve discussed in the past, accounting for this type of debt requires the recording of non-cash charges. In 2013, non-cash charges associated with the amortization of convertible senior notes and lease financings were $0.31 per diluted share. This further validates our decision to present the adjusted EPS metric, which we believe better reflects how we manage our business. Finally as Mario emphasized, we will be hosting our Investor Day Conference in New York City this Thursday, February 13 at 12:30 p.m. At that time, we will be discussing our 2014 guidance as well as other business topics. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Justin Lake with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Justin Lake - JPMorgan: Thanks. Good evening. First question, at our conference you mentioned that you laid out the states where you feel like you’re going to get full reimbursed with the industry tax. You laid out some states that are like California and Ohio and Texas where you expect to get the tax itself but [inaudible] [the gross up] [ph]. Just curious if you can give us an update there?
Mario Molina: Justin, we absolutely can you give an update and when you come on Thursday, we’ve got a nice schedule that will be going through the details where we stand on a state-by-state basis.
Justin Lake - JPMorgan: Okay. Also any numbers in terms of your expectations for perhaps the spending in 2014 or is that another one that you are going to give at the investor…?
Mario Molina: That’s another Thursday answer.
Justin Lake - JPMorgan: Okay. [Inaudible] $120 million of spending? That’s a number I hadn’t heard before. Did you discuss that before?
Mario Molina: The number is $135 million, Justin. We have discussed it before but we didn’t include the fourth quarter spend because we hadn’t done that yet.
Justin Lake - JPMorgan: Okay. So that -- those are dollars where you feel like essentially there’s $135 -- $135 million of earnings [spread] [ph] this year?
Mario Molina: That’s right.
Justin Lake - JPMorgan: How much do you expect to reoccur next year?
Mario Molina: We will be going through that on Thursday.
Justin Lake - JPMorgan: Okay. Last question then, there has been a little bit of a discussion on the pickup on cost front throughout both the Medicare Advantage and commercial sectors, we’ve heard less on the Medicaid side. Can you talk a little bit about what you saw in the fourth quarter on cost trend and any pockets where you might have seen an increase there?
Mario Molina: No. In fact for the full year, as talked about, medical margin increased and the MCR went down. So there was nothing unexpected for the fourth quarter.
Justin Lake - JPMorgan: Okay. I know [inaudible] you respond nothing in the fourth quarter. The [inaudible] a little bit higher than we expected. Nothing near that we would -- they were in line with your expectations, so what you are saying even for the fourth quarter?
Joseph White: I think - it’s Joe speaking. I think in line with our expectation, ex the impact of that Washington issue, Mario discussed at JPM.
Justin Lake - JPMorgan: Great. Thanks a lot for the color, guys.
Juan José Orellana: Thanks Justin.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Josh Raskin - Barclays: Hi. Thanks. I’ll stick with 2013. So the MLR, I guess in a couple of states, New Mexico, Utah, Florida, I guess, I know it doesn’t necessarily count a couple of months but Illinois as well came in a little bit higher than we were looking for. Would you determine -- would you say any of the states were out of ordinary, I know they moved - lot of the state fluctuations on a quarterly basis et cetera, but no change in trend or nothing that you saw in any of those specific states?
Mario Molina: Josh, are you talking about quarter or full year?
Josh Raskin - Barclays: Quarter, 4Q.
Mario Molina: 4Q, for New Mexico, I think probably we had to do with just the influx of the new membership, Florida, I don’t know Joe could speak to that. I don’t think there was anything really unaligned in Florida.
Joseph White: We’ve had some -- we’ve had some in-patient cost pressure in Florida. We think mainly [high to unusual] [ph] number of high [dollar case] [ph], there’s nothing out of the ordinary -- nothing exceptional though.
Josh Raskin - Barclays: Okay. When you say you have that, how long has that been [inaudible]?
Joseph White: I think it’s a trend in Florida we probably see since early fall.
Josh Raskin - Barclays: Okay. And is that specific, is that higher dollars per claim or are you seeing more high dollar claim?
John Molina: I think we’re seeing higher dollars per claim. It’s a pretty small population. So obviously they can do pretty easily.
Josh Raskin - Barclays: Got you.
Mario Molina: But I think it’s fair to say more intensive cases, not more intensity to the cases so to speak.
Josh Raskin - Barclays: Okay. And then the MMIS business, do you guys have an EBITDA number for the quarter?
John Molina: We have done an operating income number which we’ve shared. [We’ll give you an update] [ph] [inaudible].
Josh Raskin - Barclays: Great.
John Molina: [We can assist you] [ph] with what we’ve been running.
Josh Raskin - Barclays: Okay. Maybe while you are looking for that, did you guys give a South Carolina enrollment number? I know that was a driver of your -- I think you said the January enrolment was up for that in expansion. But did you say, John, how much was South Carolina?
John Molina: We didn’t give that Josh. We’ll give it to you Thursday.
Josh Raskin - Barclays: Thursday. Big day, Thursday. 
John Molina: Big day.
Josh Raskin - Barclays: The operating income for MMIS, then I’m off of it?
John Molina: Yeah. So that was running about -- that was about $12 million for the quarter, Josh. So a little higher than normal. They’ve had a pretty good year as a result of upsells and that kind of item.
Josh Raskin - Barclays: Okay. That’s a bit much behind. Got it. Okay. Thanks guys.
John Molina: Thanks, Josh.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities: Thank you. I wanted to circle back to New Mexico. I know that you guys go over some numbers in August, and this quarter you have three months versus two months, that’s having them on the book. But I am just wondering if that was the sole drivers for the sequential uptick is just having them one more month in the quarter. And then if so, what kind of MLRs [on your book] [ph] running at to cause such as impact?
Joseph White: I will just speak to -- certainly this is Joe speaking Sarah. I speak to certainly there are always some degree of cost pressure bringing on a new population. We have also gone a couple of years there with actually some [inaudible] small rate increases but actually a few negative rate increases -- decreases I guess that would be. So I think we are definitively feeling compared then the past I think we are feeling a little bit more cost pressure than we have in New Mexico in the past.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities: Can you remind us when rates are reset there, when you have a chance to renegotiate that?
Joseph White: They have been moving around a lot there. There was a -- generally they traditionally been set, July 1st. I think there was a further adjustment 12/01 of 2012 as a matter of fact, but I think the last two July 1s have been slight decreases.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities: Got it. And last question was just on California. There was a sequential improvement there. I believe the settlement doesn’t kick in until Jan 1. You guys had some possibly headwinds from beginning on some of the new members that entered. So should we think about that change mainly as a rate update or was there any improvements in medical management going on sequentially that helped that business?
Mario Molina: The answer to your question is both, Sarah. We did get rate increase in a couple of counties effective October 1. And then the California team has been doing a lot to bring down inpatient utilization and I think it’s ended up also now to the financials.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel, Nicolaus. Please go ahead.
Tom Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus: Hey, guys, good afternoon. So few things. First, John you said $0.31 of non-cash charges in full year 2013 related to your convert. How much of that was in fourth quarter?
John Molina: That’s a Joe question.
Joseph White: After that question Tom I look that up.
Tom Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus: Okay. Second question, I think I know the answer, but just a reminder in Texas, MLR was up quite a bit. I think that was because last year was influenced by the reversal of some reserving. Is that occurred?
Joseph White: That’s correct.
Tom Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus: So this year is more normalized.
Joseph White: I am sorry, yes.
Tom Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus: Okay. And then lastly is there -- somewhat of a conceptual question. Is there a desire on your part to put as much as expense into 2013 as possible given all of the growth opportunities in moving parts in 2014, like maybe more so than out years?
Mario Molina: Tom, I wouldn’t put it that way. I think that sort of the converse is true. There was a lot of money spent building infrastructure in preparation for all these new contracts and expansion. It had to be done in 2013. In part, it was driven by these readiness reviews where the states wanted to see that we were fully staffed for the new patients and that we were hurt by the fact that some of these things got delayed. So really it wasn’t a matter of our desire to put the costing of 2013, it just worked out that way.
Joseph White: All right. Tom, it’s Joe again. Just let me say something speaky as Chief Accounting Officer, we put the expenses and the revenues where they belong not where we likened to be. So let me just clarify that, your question about the convert is $0.90 for the three months in to 12/31. Remember we did that in February so your full year is going to be -- your fourth quarter run rate is going to be little different than your full year.
Tom Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus: All right, great. Then lastly maybe to give us a little hip on EPS 2014?
Joseph White: On Thursday.
Tom Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus: Got it. See you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carter with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Chris Carter - Credit Suisse: Thanks. Good afternoon. So realizing it’s early, can you just give us any color on how the Illinois ABD is tracking versus kind of your expectations, I know that MLR was not even 7%, but just any thoughts there in terms of rates and the MLR?
Joseph White: It's Joe speaking. I just think it's too early. We received our first membership in September and that was only, I think, less than 100 members, it's been ramping up very slowly. If anything, we've been a little disappointed at the rate at which the membership has come on. But right now the population is just too small to speak to that.
Chris Carter - Credit Suisse: And any, I mean probably same answer, but any thoughts on the Florida long-term care, can you just tell us what you kind of book in that MLR?
Joseph White: We've brought on 3000 lives effective December and we're booking that at around just below 90s.
Chris Carter - Credit Suisse: Below 90s, you said?
Mario Molina: Below 90s.
Chris Carter - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Carl McDonald with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Carl McDonald - Citigroup: Great, thanks. So if you adjust for the 135,000 lives that you brought on in South Carolina, it only looks like the enrollment grew about 65,000 or 3%. I would have expected that number to be bigger given the markets with Medicaid expansion, so any color on why the growth hasn't been as big?
Mario Molina: Yeah, Carl, this is Mario. I think that one of the things we're seeing is that the government's reporting huge numbers, people that are qualifying for Medicaid. The problem is getting them over to the Medicaid agency and enrolled and in many cases that means they have to go to a state or a county office. There has not been good electronic transfer of files from the marketplace to the state agencies. And I think that what we're seeing is a delay on the expansion. I expected we're going to see growth for Medicaid expansion throughout the first half of 2014, and I think that's the real issue here.
Carl McDonald - Citigroup: Appreciate it, Thank you.
Operator: Our next comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Mr. Fischbeck, your line is open, please raise your question.
Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, sorry about that, can you hear me now?
Mario Molina: Yeah. We can hear you.
John Molina: Go ahead, Carl
Carl McDonald - Citigroup: Okay. Yeah. So I want to go back to the California question, it sounds like obviously rate increase we saw that and then the medical measures, is there anything unusual in the Q4 MLR or is this the kind of a good way to think about the run rate?
Mario Molina: I don't think that there's anything unusual in the MLR for Q4, we'd be discussing our expectations for the business on Thursday, I would just note that we talk about run rates, remember we're getting all kinds of new products and all kinds of new populations. So it's -- it maybe more challenging just to draw a straight trend line that way.
Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, that's still helpful, but not I think unusual. I guess, your couple of line items in your payables, a little bit unusual as far as the, what was the $150 million non-risk provider payable number in the quarter and then the direct delivery cost grew dramatically, do you know what those were?
Joseph White: Sure, it's Joe, I'll speak to that. First of all, the non-risk payable it is essentially the payments with states have beginning to forward to us for disbursements to providers based upon what's [called] it, A, the Affordable Care Act, PCP Parity requirements. You'll recall the Affordable Care Act requires that physicians be paid at Medicaid -- physicians performing Medicaid or Medicaid services be paid at Medicare rates for certain services. And for the most part states are handling that via a discrete payment to us which we then forward on to our own providers. So what's you're saying is like a pass -- are pass-through dollars.
Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes, so no impact to MLR?
Joseph White: Correct, it's purely a non-risk relationship, we are just a conduit for healthy, states are reimbursing providers at Medicare PCP rates. The second issue is direct delivery, we've had a ramp up throughout this year in direct delivery activity, and Mario, John, and Terry can speak more to that, essentially I think this part of our strategy to get closer to the patient and provide a specific care our members needed. We've also entered into some other provider arrangements following that direct delivery area which are driving that cost higher.
Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Was that cost was skewed by the Medicaid parity?
Joseph White:  No. It was not.
Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then just finally with the Washington, certainly it’s hard a little bit, how much of the impact in Q4 is kind of outside of peer if you will, I guess if you were to kind of normalize the numbers, Washington just to have the current period impact what would the MLRP be?
Mario Molina: Yeah. I don’t have that MLR handy but the impact would be about $7.5 million to the med margin line.
Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: To the net margin line, okay.
Mario Molina: Med margin, medical margin line, so…
Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Medical margin.
Mario Molina: Yeah. Correct.
Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. All right. Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line Chris Rigg with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
Chris Rigg - Susquehanna: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to come back to the $135 million you increased admin costs? How much of that was in the fourth quarter?
John Molina: The fourth quarter number, I think that fourth quarter number was about $45 million.
Chris Rigg - Susquehanna: Okay. And then…
John Molina: $45 million or $50 million.
Chris Rigg - Susquehanna: Okay. And then just remind us when we think about that $135 million? Is that sort of investment spending, I wouldn’t expect to be -- you wouldn’t expect to repeat or is that just baseline costs for people building et cetera that will keep the ongoing and the future will be covered by revenue?
Mario Molina: So, Chris, we talked about this I think in the last Investor Day. There are two components of it. One is sort of the one-time fixed cost find the additional servers, gaining the configuration of the systems, those types of things. Then there was also for many states they are hiring a personnel that the state agencies wanted to see and placed before we get enrollment. Unfortunately, places like New Mexico and most to say especially South Carolina and Illinois things like delayed. So we have these bodies and program like California was another one, where the programs can’t get delayed but rather than let go very valuable employees we don’t wanted to expense. So there are two components to that spend.
Chris Rigg - Susquehanna: Anyway to sort of frame out which falls into which bucket expense wise?
Mario Molina: A pretty long and detail review of that at our last Investor Day, I would, just go back and take a look at that presentation.
Chris Rigg - Susquehanna: Okay. And then now one last and I don’t know this is a 2014 question or not, but with the dual rates, I mean, to date how did they compare to your expectations in California -- California, I am sorry?
Mario Molina: We are going to go through that again in New York we get you on Thursday.
Chris Rigg - Susquehanna: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Mario Molina: Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Anna Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
Anna Gupte - Leerink Swann: Yes. Thanks. Good evening. So just I wanted to try to stick to 2013 if I can, the first one is on Washington, is there any read across to all those states in terms of retrospective rates which you have?
Mario Molina: I don’t think there is any read across, I think that was…
Joseph White: Idiosyncratic
Mario Molina: Yes. Thank you.
Anna Gupte - Leerink Swann: Okay. And then the second one is just even near 2013, any color on Medicaid and exchange enrolment, you are talking about the welcome-mat effect and sees like one of your peer is not optimistic on it so is that something that we should look forward to?
Joseph White: We have talked though welcome-mat effect being somewhere between 5% and 10%, I think is what we said and until we see something otherwise that’s where we are going to stay with.
Anna Gupte - Leerink Swann: 5% to 10% growth off of what you have.
Joseph White: That’s right.
Anna Gupte - Leerink Swann: About 5% to 10% off that population that is eligible.
Joseph White: I would say what we have talked about is absent the welcome-mat effect, enrollment would be 5% to 10% less than what it is with the welcome-mat effect.
Anna Gupte - Leerink Swann: Okay. Got it. Got it. The last question is, I think, when we looked at your statutory filings, it seems like, I mean, certainly normalize your medical margins, but in couple of states like Florida and Texas and I just look at the times of margin normalization it seems like you are slower than some of the other players, any thoughts on that and if it’s the population health management that is slower to take effect or is that nothing we should be reading or seeing through into that?
Mario Molina: Always conscious folks kind of read anything from statutory filings.
Anna Gupte - Leerink Swann: So, I shouldn’t, is that (inaudible). So just at the quarterly progression, it seems like it was very slower.
Mario Molina: I’m sorry, could you phrase the question again. I think you’re talking about Florida and Texas, I got that far. Could you phrase the question again please?
Anna Gupte - Leerink Swann: Yes, so just in terms of normalizing the medical margin, say, in some of the states. It sound like in terms of the speed to normalization, Molina was slower. And I guess the rate adjustments are probably accruing at the same times. And I’m just wondering if I should read anything into that or is it just a way of reporting because the stat filings can be misleading sometime so.
Mario Molina: You’re asking us to compare us to our competitors and draw some inferences and we can’t do that. What we can say is how our own business is stacking up in Texas and Florida. I think that frankly, Joe, one of the reasons that Florida MCR went up in the fourth quarter is because we didn’t get the big book of business, the long-term care business which we booked at above 90% MCR. Small population with very large premiums and I think, Texas had a pretty good quarter. So again it just hard to compress to compare in terms of speed normalization against anyone else.
Anna Gupte - Leerink Swann: Okay. We know what else is offline now, just shared with the Joe and to see if get some feedback there. Thanks.
Mario Molina: Terrific, he's looking forward to that.
Joseph White: Yeah.
Anna Gupte - Leerink Swann: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Dave Windley - Jefferies: Hi, thanks for taking my question. On the $135 million question in the 45 to 50 in the fourth quarter, did you spend all that you intended to spend, was that on your target for the quarter?
Joseph White: It’s Joe speaking and generally yes.
Dave Windley - Jefferies: And does all that, was all that booked, Joe, in G&A or with some of that of a medical nature?
Joseph White: No, that’s specifically G&A. I think, we talked last time about some substantial advertising expenditure that we are going to make in the fourth quarter. We made those. It’s a variety of buyers. But -- I would say the increase we’re talking about is all revenue for which we, I mean, expense for which we haven’t seen directly yet.
Dave Windley - Jefferies: Okay. And so then coming back, if I make the adjustment for your answer to the earlier question about the Washington impact. If I make that adjustment, your MCR, I think, was up year-over-year and up sequentially by, maybe 20, 30 basis points. Is that -- several ways but… 
Joseph White: Dave, woke up there for a second. I got the point, I think you were looking at Washington and adjusting for $7.5 million revenue, I lost you after that, sorry.
Dave Windley - Jefferies: Right, okay, so after adjusting for that, MCR is still up year-over-year and sequentially. You’ve highlighted some in-patient costs in Florida. Other than that, is there anything we need to be aware of that influenced MCR in the fourth quarter?
Joseph White: I think, if you’re comparing over the fourth quarter of 2014 -- 2012, you have to look to about $30 million of favorable prior period development in the fourth quarter as we called out in Texas. So again if you are comparing the fourth quarter of 2012, it was $30 million of favorable PPD in Texas. I think beyond that I think, what we’re seeing in fourth quarter is essentially seasonality and that's about it and long ways, they are growing slight impact from Illinois in Florida.
Dave Windley - Jefferies: Okay.
Mario Molina: Well, this is Mario. When you talk about Washington, the thing that strikes me as if you look at the PMPM medical cost for the quarter was about $203 in 2012 and it's about $204 in 2013. So the medical cost haven’t change that much. The real story I think in the Washington was the revenue difference, the PMPM revenues were down. So that I think is the issue at Washington.
Dave Windley - Jefferies: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Peter Costa - Wells Fargo: Good afternoon. You became new competitor for duals in L.A. County where you were previously a subcontractor. Do you expect new competitors in your counties where you use subcontractors for duals?
Mario Molina: This is Mario. No, we don't expect any change to the mix of contractors in San Bernardino or San Diego counties. Three plans were added in Los Angeles, Caremore CareFirst and Molina, but we don't expect any other changes.
Peter Costa - Wells Fargo: And then looking at your list of Safe Harbors sort of risk factors, you changed a couple of them, one of which was just ascertains the wording around the fully grossed up reimbursement of the premium taxes to highlight the fully grossed up component, should I take that as a positive that you now have most of the premium taxes itself taking care of, or should I take that as a negative, but there's more risk you are getting in the grossed up than it was before?
Mario Molina: This is Mario. You should take that as a change by Jeff Barlow who wanted some clarity. I think, we are trying to be more clear about what the risk is.
Peter Costa - Wells Fargo: Okay. And you added another one, which is the efforts by states to recoup previously paid mounts including-- I think the Tropicana Washington as well. But you talked about other states potentially. Is there some other state that you are worried about a similar retroactive reimbursement the way it happened in Washington?
Mario Molina: No, we are not. But I think that we want to make that a general risk factor because it could happen in other states. We don’t have it on the horizon right now, but given that's happened in Washington, we just want to make people aware at different time-to-time states might do something like this.
Peter Costa - Wells Fargo: Okay. And the Washington thing is that with the way you are talking about in here with the psychotropic drugs, is that correct?
Mario Molina: Yes.
Peter Costa - Wells Fargo: Okay. And then lastly you added risk factor about hep C. Is that just because we are closer to 2014, or was there some change in terms of your expectations for what’s going on with hep C and the new drugs that are coming out there?
Mario Molina: No, I think that really reflects the fact that there are new drugs available that were not available in the past. Also the recommendations for increased screening, we really don't know what the prevalence of hepatitis C is in the population and there have not been very effective treatments in the past. So this is an area that's evolving.
Peter Costa - Wells Fargo: Okay. So it’s nothing new other than the complete factor that there are new drugs coming out. But it’s unchanged your view of how the structure is coming out.
Mario Molina: I think it’s that plus the fact that the new screen recommendations. The prevalence of hepatitis c is really unknown and the CDC estimate is about 3 million. It was a study from UCLA that came out and says closer to 6 million and until we get more testing we won’t really know. But we will discuss that more on Thursday.
Peter Costa - Wells Fargo: Okay. And then last question on Illinois, the $1200 PMPM, is that a good PMPM rate to look at that business going forward and then perhaps for all duals, or is that something unique about this quarter since the starting out?
Mario Molina: Yeah. We don’t have duals there yet. So, I think it’s probably little early to extrapolate, especially given the small numbers that we have and we don't yet have the duals folded in yet.
Peter Costa - Wells Fargo: Okay. Thank you. 
John Molina: Again, that’s just for the ABD in Illinois, not for the duals.
Peter Costa - Wells Fargo: Got it.
Operator: Our last question today comes from Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Michael Baker - Raymond James: Thanks a lot. I was wondering if you guys could more specifically address hep C, whether or not you’ve seen anything meaningful on the cost side there first off.
Mario Molina: Thursday.
Michael Baker - Raymond James: Okay. And then secondly, as you're dealing with these newer populations, any challenges on continuity of care provisions relative to our implementation of your medical management protocols?
Mario Molina: I don't think that there's anything in terms of the continuity of care that is not something that we haven’t already encountered in previous rollouts yeah.
Michael Baker - Raymond James: Okay. Thanks for the update. Look forward to Thursday.
Mario Molina: Okay. So, I’m assuming there are no further questions. And I just want to remind you all that we will be discussing guidance for 2014 and a number of other factors, which have been alluded to you today. And we hope to see you at the Investor Day, Thursday afternoon.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Molina Healthcare Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, October 30, 2013. I would now like to turn the conference over to Juan José Orellana, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan Jose Orellana: Thank you, Circe. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare's financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2013. The company's Earnings Release was issued today after the market closed and is now posted for viewing on our company website. On the call with me today are Dr. Mario Molina, our CEO; John Molina, our CFO; Terry Bayer, our Chief Operating Officer; and Joseph White, our Chief Accounting Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our comments today will contain forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K annual report, our Form 10-Q quarterly reports and our Form 8-K current reports. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab of our company website, or on the SEC's website. All forward-looking statements made during today's call represent our judgments as of October 30, 2013, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements except as required by securities laws. This call is being recorded, and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available at our company's website, molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina.
Joseph Mario Molina: Thank you, Juan José. And hello, everyone. Our third quarter results once again demonstrate our ability to strengthen our company by capturing the long-term opportunities available to us while executing our near-term initiatives, such as organic growth, acquisitions and operational improvements. And while 2 items, the prior period developments in Texas and the ramp-up of general administrative costs associated with building for future growth, affected our strong operating results. We are pleased with the quarter, particularly since the medical margin improved in all but one of our health plans. John will discuss in greater detail our financial results for the quarter during his remarks. Let's start with a topic that's generated considerable media coverage in the last few weeks: the marketplace. As you know from all the headlines, the rollout of the Affordable Care Act program has been stalled by technical difficulties with federal and state health insurance marketplace websites. Please remember that we are participating in the marketplaces in 9 states, where there is a mix of federal and state-run health insurance exchanges. However, given the technical difficulties and the reliability of the information, we believe it is premature to comment on enrollment figures at this time. We are focused on improving our marketplace platform by continuing to build on our provider network, preparing our call centers to take additional calls and in making our own web portal more robust. Investments in the operational readiness of our platform must be made regardless of the enrollment. Lastly, in anticipation of glitches with the health insurance marketplaces, we had delayed some of our marketing and outreach activities to the second half of the fourth quarter to allow for more time for website fixes. Given the current struggles and confusion associated with the marketplace rollout, we will be increasing our initial fourth quarter sales and outreach activities as well as generating progress -- product awareness through advertising. We will continue to monitor any developments in the marketplace and respond accordingly. Another key provision of the Affordable Care Act is the expansion of Medicaid coverage to anyone whose income is at or below 138% of the federal poverty line. Last week Governor John Kasich of Ohio announced the approval of Medicaid expansion, meaning that an additional 275,000 low-income Ohio residents will now be eligible for health care under the Medicaid program. Ohio is our 4th largest health plan in terms of enrollment, and as of July 1 of this year, we began operating statewide. This development brings to 6 the number of states in which Molina operates that are pursuing Medicaid expansion. Ohio is expected to implement the expansion of the Medicaid program on January 1, 2014. So we will begin hiring additional staff to accommodate that growth as needed. Outreach and awareness generated by the marketplace rollout and the expansion of Medicaid are likely to result in a welcome-mat effect. The welcome-mat effect describes the behavior of many people who are currently eligible but not enrolled in Medicaid, who, as a result of the marketplace awareness, will become enrolled in Medicaid. We believe this welcome-mat effect is likely to result in growth in Medicaid enrollment, even in states where there is no planned Medicaid expansion, like South Carolina, Texas and Wisconsin. Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal and other publications have reported a surge in Medicaid enrollment across certain states. In Washington, for example, 87% of those joining new plans during the first 3 weeks of October were joining Medicaid plans. While it's too early to know how many of those enrolling were already eligible for Medicaid, it suggests that a large percentage of individuals seeking health insurance in the marketplace actually qualify for Medicaid. As it relates to the dual-eligible program, the implementation date for Illinois has slipped again. The program is now expected to begin on February 1, 2014. These types of delays extend the length of time in which we are incurring administrative costs without any revenue. As Terry discussed at the investor day, in some instances, programs have been delayed even after we passed readiness reviews, as was the case in California and Illinois. And we've also taken an important step in South Carolina as we successfully completed the application process for the South Carolina dual-eligible demonstration, and we will move to readiness review. As of today, the dual-eligible program start dates for our 4 other states, in addition to Illinois, remained unchanged. And they are as follows: Ohio, March 1, 2014; California, April 1, 2014; South Carolina, July 1, 2014; and in Texas, January 1, 2015. Last week, our Florida health plan was awarded Medicaid contracts for 3 regions by the state of Florida that include Miami-Dade, Orlando and Palm Beach. These contracts are expected to commence on second or third quarters of 2014. We expect that these awards will allow us to increase our Medicaid managed care membership. We're pleased to continue to provide quality health care services to Florida's Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries. When combined with our Florida plan's long-term care contract, our Medicare Special Needs plan and marketplace offering, these contract awards mean that Molina Healthcare Florida will remain a strong presence in that state. As a reminder, the Florida long-term care program, through which we will provide institutional and home and community-based services to beneficiaries, is scheduled to begin in its first region on December 1, with additional regions following in 2014. I also want to update you on the start-up of our Illinois health plan. In September, we enrolled our first ABD members. We expect enrollment to grow slowly in the fourth quarter as the state has delayed ABD passive enrollment. As I mentioned a moment ago, we also expect enrollment of our first dual-eligible members in Illinois in 2014, albeit delayed from January to February. Next, I am pleased to report that we have reached a final agreement with the state of California on several Medi-Cal disputes dating back to 2003. This agreement is significant because it will extend our existing contracts for an additional 5 years while helping to protect the margins of the California plan moving forward. In addition, the agreement also includes a contract award for Imperial County, a new service area adjacent to San Diego County, expected to commence on November 1, 2013. As you can see from the efforts underway, we continue laying the groundwork for additional growth in 2014 and beyond. However, even during this highly active period, we have continued our focus on quality. That focus is evidenced by the recent announcement from the National Committee on Quality Assurance of the inclusion of Molina Healthcare's eligible health plans in NCQA's Medicaid Health Insurance Plan Rankings for 2013. Molina's health plans have consistently been accredited and ranked for quality by NCQA. Molina Healthcare Utah is the only Medicaid plan in the state of Utah that is accredited by NCQA, and Molina Healthcare's Medicaid plans in New Mexico and Washington are the highest-ranked plans in their respective states. Another indication of our continued commitment to quality comes from this year's progress on the Medicare STAR ratings. Each year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services assign ratings of 1 to 5 stars to Medicare plans to make it easier for consumers to compare them. This year, all of our Medicare plans earned 3 or more stars, an improvement over the previous year. This is important because earning 3 or more stars makes us eligible for passive enrollment of Medicare beneficiaries in the new Medicare, Medicaid or duals contracts. I want to remind everyone that the 2013 influenza season is now upon us. While the flu isn't always thought of as a life-threatening illness, the dangers and complications that influenza can have on the elderly and children can be quite severe. Influenza can be fatal even in children without high-risk medical conditions. This highlights the importance of recommendations that people, including all of you on the call today, should receive annual flu shots. We will be redoubling our efforts to encourage our members to get vaccinated. In closing, during the third quarter, we accelerated our preparations for growth in 2014, even as we took immediate steps to grow our business now. We've closed on our acquisitions in New Mexico and South Carolina. We welcomed our first members in Illinois, and we continued to prepare for expansion opportunities in 2014. I'll now turn the call over to John.
John C. Molina: Thank you, Mario. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported net income from continuing operations of $0.16 per diluted share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $0.01 per diluted share reported in the third quarter of 2012. Significantly, we experienced negative prior period development in our Texas health plan of $14 million, which represented approximately $0.16 per diluted share. This negative PPD largely relates to claims incurred in 2012. We are pleased with these results, which, with a couple of exceptions, were consistent with our expectations. We continue to benefit from our efforts to deliver medical care more efficiently. We increased our revenue as a result of our recent acquisition in New Mexico, and our revenue diversification efforts continued to bear fruit. On the other hand, administrative expenses related to the revenue we won't receive until 2014 reduced our earnings. And we continue to be concerned about the adequacy of premium rates for California ABD population. With that said, let's look at the third quarter in more detail. Premium revenue in the third quarter grew to $1.6 billion, representing a 9% increase over the same period last year. The increase in premium revenue was mainly driven by a 5% increase in enrollment and a 4% increase in revenue per member per month. As I've just noted, we have made substantial progress in delivering medical care more efficiently. Our consolidated medical care ratio decreased to 87.3% in the third quarter of 2013 compared with 91.1% in the same period last year. Medical care ratios decreased and medical margins increased at all health plans except Florida. Put another way, per-member per-month revenue grew by almost 4%, while medical costs per-member per-month held steady. This is clear proof of improved core operational performance and gives us confidence as we prepare for growth next year. Revenue diversification remains an important part of our focus. Efficient operations across multiple health plans, which we demonstrated again this quarter, are important if we are to withstand the temporary setbacks that occasionally affect any single plan. I also want to emphasize the continued strong financial performance of our Molina Medicaid Solutions segment. We haven't spent much time talking about MMS in the last couple of years, but our financial results in that business have been very satisfying. Revenue diversification will be even more important over the next year or 2. As we begin serving members under a large number of new programs, there is a chance that rates may not be set adequately at the start of these programs. We're confident that rates will improve over time as more information is learned about these populations. But in the short run, we may experience considerable financial pressure. We believe that our broad diversification across geographies and programs will enable us to better withstand any potential errors in rate development by the state. Our belief in the importance of revenue diversification has driven our recent acquisitions in New Mexico and South Carolina as well as our recent start-up in Illinois. Moving on to administrative costs. As we have said before, there is a lot of effort involved in preparing for the new revenue we will realize in 2014. We've spoken at length about our Medicare, Medicaid and marketplace opportunities in 2014. But even beyond that, we are gearing up for expansion into long-term care services in Florida and into both long-term care and behavioral health services in New Mexico. In South Carolina, we are preparing to bring on an entirely new health plan in January and a Medicare-Medicaid Plan later in the year. And in Illinois, we do not expect to have meaningful enrollment until early next year. For some time now, we have been incurring considerable expense to build the infrastructure to support these initiatives. That infrastructure build continues as these new opportunities. For example, in South Carolina and in Texas, dual-eligible opportunities come into focus. Much as with an acquisition, we need to invest money in administrative infrastructure before we can realize the benefits of the new revenue. But unlike an acquisition, where most costs are capitalized, many of these costs are expensed immediately. In addition to infrastructure expenditures, we are now seeing increased G&A spend for the operational ramp-up of some of these opportunities. We are now hiring more member services, claims and care coordination personnel to support our marketplace and Medicaid expansions and the additional membership in Ohio, Illinois, New Mexico and Florida beginning in January. To give you an idea of the scale of these efforts, let's look at our Illinois health plan where we don't expect meaningful membership until early next year because of the state delay in ABD auto assignment. In Illinois, we incurred $2.5 million in administrative expense in just the third quarter. To support that expense stream, we only had 188 members in September, the first month for which we had any membership in Illinois at all. Despite the delays in implementation, regulators expect us to be fully staffed. The result of these efforts across the company is that G&A increased during the third quarter of 2013 to 10.4% of total revenue, compared to 8.2% of total revenue for the same period last year. We estimate that we incurred about $30 million of general and administrative expense in the third quarter related to future revenue. As I will discuss in a moment, this spend will grow considerably in the fourth quarter. I also want to remind everyone that premium rates are still a challenge. Our Texas health plan received a 6% rate increase effective September 1, but our Michigan plan received only a 1% increase effective October 1. Our Ohio health plan actually received a combination of premium decreases and increases to fee schedules affective July 1, 2013, that had the effect of a 3.5% decrease to medical margin as a percent of premium revenue. Specifically, premium revenue in Ohio decreased due to an overall premium rate reduction and a decrease in ABD risk adjustment revenue, while costs increased due to a rebasing of inpatient fee schedules. We disagree with some of the state's assumptions related to these new rates and are pursuing the matter with the state. In California, we are expecting a rate increase of about 2% effective October 1 and another 2% effective January 1. We still do not believe that California rates are adequate to put a medical benefit provided to ABD members. As we move into 2014 and realize revenue growth, we expect our financial focus to shift from G&A costs to premium rates. At this juncture, there are no states that have set rates for the Medicaid expansion populations. And while we remain confident that the states will reimburse us for the industry excise tax included in the Affordable Care Act, the outlook for reimbursement for the income tax consequences of that excise tax is somewhat less certain. We continue to engage in discussions with our state partners on this issue. Several states have told us they are awaiting instructions from CMS. We will continue to emphasize the importance of adequate premium rates in improving quality of care and encouraging better health outcomes. Moving to the balance sheet. At September 30, 2013, the company had cash and investments of almost $1.7 billion, including approximately $470 million at our parent company. Cash flow from operations in the third quarter was artificially increased by the timing of receipts and payments for a number of items, including deferred revenue, accounts payable and payments that we process on behalf of our state partners without assuming any medical cost risk. We anticipate many of these items affecting cash flow will reverse in the fourth quarter. Days and claims payable increased from 38 days at June 30, 2013, to 41 days at September 30, 2013. This increase is not impacted by the payable related to the pass-throughs that I just mentioned. Based on our year-to-date results, as well as better visibility into administrative expenditures in the fourth quarter, as we've just discussed, we have lowered our full year earnings guidance and now expect earnings per share from continuing operations to be approximately $1.15 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2013. At $1.15 per diluted share, our 2013 estimates still represent a considerable year-over-year improvement when compared to the $0.21 per diluted share reported for all of 2012. As we discussed at Investor Day, adjusted net income per diluted share is a key metric for us. Therefore, on an adjusted net income per diluted share basis, this translates into approximately $3.20 per share for our guidance for 2013. We will be referring to this metric more in the future. Some of you joining us today may be questioning our guidance reduction after announcing a part of that, except for the unexpected provider costs in Texas, matched our expectations. Simply put, we now expect the fourth quarter administrative costs to be even greater than we originally anticipated. Delays in enrollment at the Illinois health plan, a delayed start-up in our South Carolina operations and our expansion into Imperial County in Southern California mean that we will incur even more administrative costs without related revenue in the fourth quarter. Equally important, as a result of problems with the marketplace websites, we've decided to increase our advertising and other member outreach expenditures in the fourth quarter. If necessary, we will continue this increased spend into 2014. As Mario mentioned, we have reached final agreement with the state of California on several Medi-Cal disputes dating back to 2003. The financial terms are consistent with a tentative agreement that we shared with you at Investor Day. A settlement account applicable to our Medi-Cal TANF, medical ABD and dual-eligible lines of business in California has been established. After each period, the account balance will be adjusted to account for a deficit or a surplus. Generally speaking, a surplus will accrue if Molina's margin exceeds 3.25%, while a deficit accrues if our margin falls below 3.25%. That surplus or deficit will apply to 75% of our California health plan revenue in 2014, and 50% of our revenue in later years. Upon the exploration of a settlement agreement in 2017, the settlement account, if in a deficit position, would result in a payment to Molina from the state, up to a maximum of $40 million. If the settlement account is in a surplus position, no amount is owed by either party. Equally, or even more importantly, the settlement agreement extends each of the California health plan's existing Medi-Cal managed care contracts for an additional 5 years, including its contracts in San Diego, San Bernardino, Riverside and Sacramento counties. It also awards Molina a new Medi-Cal managed care contract for 5 years in Imperial County. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Justin Lake with JPMorgan.
Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: First question is on the prior period costs in the quarter. Can you flesh that out a little bit more in terms of where those costs came from,, and more importantly, your level of confidence that the poll issues have been recognized in the third quarter results?
John C. Molina: That's a great question, Justin. So these are related to claims dating back to 2012 that were adjudicated, and so we thought that they were put to bed, so to speak. But providers appealed, and due to some operational issues that we had discovered this year relating back to 2012, we ended up paying additional monies out and then reserving for the final cleanup. I would say that this quarter finally puts to bed the operational issues that we suffered in Texas, beginning in February of 2012. And I think most importantly, as Terry has talked about, we've turned over a lot of the management in Texas, and they're much more confident that the operational issues in Texas are behind us.
Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, great. And then on the industry tax, sounds like you're a little less certain in terms of the lack of deductibility which follows on some of your peers saying the same thing. Is it reasonable to think that the -- can you give us -- I guess, what I'm asking, is there any way to kind of quantify if we were to say 100% of that deductibility is at risk or the lack of deductibility? Do you feel like it's happenstance that you're having this -- the more difficult conversation with or uncertainty around? Or should we -- can you assume the entirety of that market deductibility might be at risk into 2014? Any way to kind of quantify that for us?
John C. Molina: Yes, I don't think we can quantify it for you simply because most of the states have not addressed the issue. So when we say that we lack certainty, it is not because the states have said they're not going to reimburse this for us, it's just that they are silent. Many of the states have told us they're waiting for instructions from CMS. I believe that Michigan is the only state that has affirmatively stated that they intend to reimburse us for it.
Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And mechanically, is it your expectation that sometime between now and let's say during -- early next year, you're going to get a rate increase that'll be effective January 1? That will basically making poll on the industry tax -- big step a state tends to make you whole. Is that the way they should work?
Joseph W. White: This is Joe speaking. I think that most -- the conversation with most states is that they would prefer, and I think we would prefer, they make a lump sum payment rather than building the amount into the ratings. So most states are indicating that they will make us hold on the tax piece, perhaps not the income tax deductibility but the tax piece upon our determination of how much we're going to owe the feds. So if we [indiscernible] even outside of the rate structure.
Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then one last question. The -- obviously, there's a lot of opportunity. You're making some investments early on to cover that. Any update in terms of how we should think about your revenue growth over the next 2 years, thinking about 2014 year-over-year. And then I know you have that $12.5 billion number out there. Any -- are you thinking there's upside to that number given the opportunity out there? Just any update there will be great.
John C. Molina: Sure, Justin. This is John. In terms of the revenue growth over the next 2 years, we're sticking with our $12.5 billion number.
Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: How should we think about '14?
John C. Molina: You can think about '14 when we give guidance in February.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I guess more pressing issues. Fourth quarter. So I'm just trying to understand some of these G&A costs. I guess my first question would be how much of it relates to the market size or, as you call it, exchanges?
John C. Molina: You know, we're not going to split out, Josh, how much relates to this product or that product. In some respects, there is spillover, right? So as people go to the websites and think that they may be eligible for a marketplace product, find that they're eligible for Medicaid. Then, how do we differentiate the cost for that? What we do is we look at when we anticipate the enrollment's going to be, make sure we're staffed up to handle that enrollment and let the numbers follow.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Well, okay. So, John, I guess others have suggested across -- broadly across health care services land that the marketplaces are getting pushed back and delayed. And so they're actually pushing back some of the marketing and the spending, et cetera, to wait until the exchanges are fully operational, et cetera. So I sort of think about your strategy was theoretically one of defense in nature where you're going to try and maintain that churn population in your plans, and now maybe there's less people jumping into exchanges. So I'm just curious why you'd be spending more and not less.
John C. Molina: Because unlike some of the other plans, we were -- are trying to maximize the Medicaid, the welcome mat, which were -- as Mario talked about, reports are that those seem to be the biggest initial pushes for people, and we want to make sure that people continue to try and sign up. Whether it's through the websites or calling our call centers and getting navigators, getting the paper applications in, we feel that we can't let the issue die.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And so -- and most of your states have the ability for members to select their plan, correct, before they get auto-assigned if they turn out to be Medicaid-eligible already?
Joseph Mario Molina: That's correct, Josh. This is Mario.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. Okay, that's helpful. The second question on taxes. When you say sort of operational issues, et cetera, it sounds just basically like you guys denied claims that turned out you shouldn't have denied them. And so now they're -- now you have to pay them out. I guess I'm curious, does that change your perspective on sort of the run rate cost trend that you're seeing in Texas? Do you feel like you're adequately reserved for future trends? And do you think rates should be retroactively reset to sort of accounts with these higher costs?
Joseph W. White: And now, this is Joe speaking. Well, first of all, we think we've caught up with this, and we don't anticipate any more unfavorable prior period development for this issue. The second point is we really feel like, with the -- we feel like Texas is treating us fairly. I think it's a fair statement after the rate increase we received on September 1, so we would not anticipate going back and asking for anything.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got you, okay. And then just last question. If we could just take a step back, how do you guys think about net margins? It's been a couple of years now of depressed overall sort of net margins. And what do you think is to that -- 2015. Let's skip '14 because I know there's a lot of ramp-up there as well. But when you're doing $12.5 billion on the top line, theoretically, a more normalized G&A level, et cetera, what's the net margin for your overall book of business supposed to look like?
John C. Molina: Josh, I think we've been pretty consistent in saying 2%.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And there's nothing that you see -- I mean, it just feels like with some of the additional G&A, et cetera, but you think that normalizes over time and you're sticking with the 2%.
Joseph Mario Molina: Josh, this is Mario. I'm really encouraged by the progress we've made in the medical cost area this quarter. And so, yes, we're going to stick with that 2%. I think that eventually, as the enrollment grows, the percentage that we're spending on admin will drop. And if we can continue to make progress, as we have been on the medical costs, we think those numbers are achievable in the long term.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: I just wanted to follow up on the 2015 guidance question. It -- I mean, it seems like there's a few positive items that weren't incorporated in the last update of guidance. Now we have a higher expansion, which, at a previous investor day, you guys had talked about it being in the $650 million range. There's South Carolina duals, which I was estimating to be another $350 million to $600 million in revenue. And then the Florida acute win, which could be about $410 million. So it just seems like there's a lot of positive news that's not yet baked into the 2015 guidance. Just wondering if you could give thoughts on if there's any additional headwinds that are offsetting that or if it's just being conservative at this point.
Joseph Mario Molina: Sarah, this is Mario. I think we've done a pretty good job at detailing all the headwinds. And you're right. There is still considerable upside from these new contracts, new programs, new states. And that's why I'm so optimistic. We have not provided an update on guidance. We're going to do that in February, but you've outlined some of the new issues.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay. It just seemed like it could go up by at least $1 billion or more. Got it. And then in Ohio, there's a few moving pieces. We have the new members coming in, in August, and then last quarter, you spoke to benefit from risk adjusters. And now there's an ABD revenue reduction. So if you could just give a little bit more detail. Are the new members coming in around the risk score range that you anticipated? Was there any benefit on some of those numbers from risk adjusters or did it some other way and if that's related at all to the ABD revenue reduction?
Joseph W. White: This is Joe speaking, Sarah. No, these -- the margin impression we're talking about in Ohio doesn't have anything to do uniquely with the new members that came on July 1. The risk adjustment issue isn't effective July. The risk adjusters for the ABD population overall for the entire State of Ohio were reset, and we've always had a very aggressive effort at capturing costs, ensuring that information with the state and getting our members the right medical care they need. As a result, we've traditionally attracted members with more complex needs and met those needs and been able to document that with the state. It just so happens that on the latest reset, either because of member mix changes or because other health plans are doing a better job in terms of their encounter submissions, proportionally, we received a reduction in risk adjusters. But it doesn't speak into anything that happened with the new membership coming on July 1.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And last question. In the prepared remarks, a concern was voiced over the California ABD rates. So just wondering if you could talk a little bit about that? And in context of your new settlement, wouldn't that be covered by the margin guarantee?
John C. Molina: Sarah, this is John. To the extent that our margin for the California plan falls below 3.25%, for whatever reason, the new settlement would kick in. We do continue to believe that the rates are set too low for the benefits and the utilization and that the ABD members in California are yenning. We continue to share that data with the state, and I believe that the next rate cycle, the state will actually utilize health plan data as opposed to fee-for-service data trended forward. So we are hoping that, that will be reflected in rates come next year.
Joseph Mario Molina: Sarah, this is Mario. There's one other point I want to make on that, too. While we have a settlement agreement with the state of California, that offers us some protection on the margins. Most health plans in California do not. So most of the Medicaid plans in California continue to be concerned, as we are, about the adequacy of rates. And we will all continue to press the issue with the state because we want the rates to be set appropriately, regardless of any kind of settlement. The rates need to be fair. They need to reflect the acuity of the patients that we're serving whether there's a settlement agreement or not.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. Just wanted to follow up maybe on that California item. Is it -- I think you mentioned that it was going to cover 75% of the population in '14 and then 50% after that. Can you go into what's driving that, wipe out the entire population?
Joseph W. White: Sure. It's Joe speaking. We just wanted to make the concept as clear as we can in terms of how the arithmetic works. The way the agreement works is that the -- to the extent that our margin differs from 3.25% margin, we will receive 75% of that difference in margin for our entire revenue. So we didn't quite find a simpler way to say it.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Oh, so they're different, okay. Okay, the difference is in margin, I thought you were talking about different revenue streams. I guess when you talked about the revenue streams that this sort of applied to, I think you said TANF, ABD and then duals, is Medicaid expansion something different? Or does that fall into one of those buckets?
John C. Molina: It would fall -- this is John -- it would fall into the settlement agreement. The reason that it steps down Year 2 is because the premise is that the settlement is to make up for prior years where the rates were not adequate. So implicit in that is the state is going to continue to work to make sure the rates are more adequate in the future. The closer they get to getting the absolute right rate, the less we will need it, so the less that they're going to fund that differential.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, that makes sense. And then just going back to the G&A spend, wonder if maybe you can try and cut it in a different way. Which is -- I mean, you have a couple of new contracts like Imperial or maybe South Carolina or Texas tools coming to more focus. How much of that is -- of this higher spend is because of some of those clearly delineated new -- or more focus on until the revenue opportunities versus some of the other stuff, that's just kind of executing on something you already know about. How much is really new revenue opportunities?
John C. Molina: You now probably say so -- as Joe -- or I mean, as I mentioned, $30 million was the differential between third quarter of this year, third quarter of last year. I think another probably 25% is going to go to the new contracts on top of that. Plus, then you got to layer in the increased advertising and outreach we're going to be doing and then the operational ramp-up as well.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And when you have in here care coordination, medical management capabilities, that's more tied to new markets rather than kind of looking at something and saying, "Oh, I do need to do more in our existing markets," or does it encompass both?
Joseph Mario Molina: Yes, this is Mario. I think that it encompasses both. For example, the duals contracts are going to require us to have more in the way of care managers, probably some additional medical directors, and that's in an existing state. In a place like South Carolina, it will bring up a whole new health plan. We've got to hire all the staff for that health plan, including the care management. So it overlaps, and it really is a function of the growth and the change in the mix of patients that we're going to be experiencing.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel.
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: So I mean, most everything I've been thinking about has been talked about here tonight. I guess relative to your Investor Day, which was fairly positive in my view, and today, what would you say is kind of the largest item within your expectations that has changed? Maybe it sounds like a decision to spend more on the G&A side. Or I don't want to put words in your mouth. Maybe that's the answer. But maybe if you could talk to kind of like what is really changed between the Investor Day and today that's creating the change in guidance and a different view of fourth quarter and all that kind of stuff?
John C. Molina: Well, so, Tom, this is John. Let me first -- maybe I misheard you, but you seemed to imply that we had a positive Investor Day and today's not so positive. I'm like Mario. I'm pretty optimistic, and I think that our net in that PPD from Texas would've been right on our number. We still would have said that we're incurring higher costs in Q4, and that's really the operational readiness, the G&A spend, in part because we did win some new business and in part because the issues related to the marketplace is causing us to want to increase the outreach.
Joseph Mario Molina: Okay, Tom, this is Mario. Tom, let me just finish. I think that if you take the claims issue that we have in Texas and if you take the $2.5 million we spent on Illinois with basically no membership and you reverse that, we would've exceeded analyst expectations for the quarter. The medical costs came down pretty much across the board, and I think it was, absent that, a very strong quarter. John's right. We are spending more to build up for our growth next year. And some of these things, like the Imperial County, we're running around, putting together a network and bringing up a new service area that we really hadn't anticipated was going to come so quickly. So there are some things that we have to spend that have been accelerated. But overall, and John's having a field day with this, I'm actually optimistic, and I'm not usually the optimistic one.
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's a very fair framework. I appreciate that. I didn't mean to imply anything. I guess I was getting at it sounded like you maybe made a decision to kind of crank the G&A a bit more, which, again, I think is just -- is what I'm hearing in the conversation tonight?
Joseph Mario Molina: That's true.
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. The -- I'm good with that. The medical claims payable number is up a bit. I mean, maybe what's driving that? If you could.
Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking. It's a number of things. if you're looking at the consolidated number on the balance sheet, John had mentioned that we're -- date in claims payable is up. That's about $16 million this quarter. We also just had some minor timing issues in terms of cap payment, which drove it up, and we've also in this quarter, and we talked about this in the cash flow section. There are a number of states that views us a vehicle to pass through certain payments to providers, usually hospitals. These are cases where states will give money to us and then instruct us to pay the sort of hospitals or other providers. And it just so happened we got a lot of those payments late in the quarter, so -- and didn't have a chance to disperse them until early October. So we can...
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: So where might that...
Joseph W. White: Go ahead.
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I was just going to say, directionally, where -- what does that number look like a quarter from now?
Joseph W. White: It's up about $138 million versus December, and about $16 million of that's IPMP. So I think the rest of that more or less reverses next quarter. I think John alluded to the fact in his remarks, we had a lot of onetime items. I'd -- won't say onetime items. We've just had a lot of items we think that are going to reverse in December, or in the fourth quarter.
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then one last thing, just kind of conceptually, given the newness of the duals programs and the Florida LTC program, and these things that just keep getting delayed, more so than we've seen in the prior, I don't know, decade or 15 years where new programs started up, and we do tend to see delays, right? But it feels like kind of more so than usual. Do you have a dialogue going with any of your state partners to perhaps provide some recourse to you down the line to make up for some of the G&A drag that you're absorbing right now? Is that part of the conversation at all?
Joseph Mario Molina: Tom, this is Mario. No, we've not specifically addressed that with them. And I think that the reason we're seeing all these delays is that the state and federal government are trying to bring up a lot of programs simultaneously. In past years, these things would roll out, one this year, one next year. But CMS is trying to bring these duals, all these duals contracts up in a period of about 2 years. It's an aggressive timeframe, and I think that they're struggling just in terms of the staff that they have. I think the government shutdown kind of hurt things a little bit. And I also think that the state are struggling because remember, in this recession, states laid off staff. And so now that things are turning around and they're bringing up these new programs, a lot of the people that were there several years ago are now gone. So you've got new staff who are younger, have less experience. Or in many cases, you just don't have the staff, period, that they had in previous years. And I think that's what's -- a lot of what's driving the delays.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies.
David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: On California, would you be willing to call out specifically what rate increase you think you need to kind of bring the ABD rates to adequacy or conversely and talk about what your ABD MLR is right now?
John C. Molina: We generally don't split out MCRs by line of business.
Joseph Mario Molina: So in other words, no.
David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Yes, understand that. You've called it out several times in the -- on the -- or talked about it several times in the call, I thought I'd try to get the heart of the issue. The other question I have is around your G&A discussion and readiness. I think you had previously talked about 2014 seeing that number decline somewhat. Now in 2013, the number is going up. I'm wondering how we should think about that trajectory for 2014 off of this new base?
John C. Molina: We're -- this is John. We're still expecting, as a percent of revenue, that the G&A will go down in 2014.
David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: And any magnitude on that?
Joseph Mario Molina: This is Mario. I think a lot of it's a function of the membership growth, right? Because as the revenues grow, a lot of the G&A costs will be fixed. So as the revenues grow, G&A as a percent goes down. You have got fixed costs embedded in this with staff that we've already hired and we've been training. Some of the things are variable, like the amount we spend on advertising and outreach, and that we have a little bit more control over. But as Terry has pointed out in the past, when we go through these readiness reviews, the states want to see bodies in those chairs, and they want to be sure that we're fully staffed. And then what's happened is that they have pulled the rug out from under us and said, "We're going to delay this for 2 or 3 months." And it's been a problem. Whether that ever gets addressed or not, I don't know. I hope that at some point, state recognizes the additional costs that they caused us to incur, but I can't guarantee it.
David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: So maybe I'll ask in a slightly different way. I was thinking in terms of dollars of spend going down. Would you expect that you're actually -- especially in light of ramping that number up in the fourth quarter, would you expect the dollars or readiness spend to decline in 2014 or just to decline as a percent of revenue?
John C. Molina: This is John. I would say decline as a percent of revenue because as the infrastructure build up on most of these programs, you got the operational ramp which will take over. And as Mario said, it really depends on when our enrollment becomes and how big that operational ramp is. But then also, the cycle starts over again, right? So now we're starting to prepare for the South Carolina and Texas duals, which is some more infrastructure build. But as a percentage of revenue, I think you'll see it go down. In terms of the growth, in terms of the total dollars, it should slow down, but it will still be up.
David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. And last question on Florida. That's the one market that you talked about where medical loss ratio did not decline. What remediation steps are you taking there? Is it all rate or can actually do something operationally to improve?
Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking. We've seen some indication that it did. Like in Ohio, a rebasing that took effect earlier this year in terms of the fee schedule may have impacted us. We're also due to hear very shortly on the rate adjustment effective September 1. The state's a little bit late on that, but we'll have to wait and see what that -- when that number comes in before we can really assess where we're at in Florida. We've done a very good job in the last few years in Florida, though, for lowering health care costs. And they're certainly considerably below where they were a couple of years ago.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna International Group.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I just want to make sure I heard you correctly. With regard to the California settlement agreement, did you say the maximum remuneration is $40 million?
John C. Molina: Yes.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. So I guess I just -- my real question stems from that. So if I look at your peer who has a similar agreement -- they're larger, but they're not 6.5x to 7x larger than you guys in the state. So can you help us understand why their maximum amount on a relative basis is so much greater than yours?
Joseph Mario Molina: Sure, this is Mario. Remember, these are issues that go back to 2003. And a lot of the settlement comes out of those early years, and that was the time when we were much smaller. So it's -- you can't -- you're sort of comparing apples and oranges.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. All right, that makes sense. And then when you think about the administrative spend in the fourth quarter, it was $30 million that you spiked down in the third quarter. So for the fourth quarter, can you give us what the number might actually be or how we should think about that?
Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking. I think you could look to that incremental piece of the spending for the fourth quarter being $40 to $45 million.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Carl McDonald with Citigroup.
Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. So 2 more California agreement questions. So the first one is if the California agreement had been in place in 2013, how much of an impact would it have had on the financials? I don't know if it's easier to do that relative to the 90% loss ratio or versus the $1.15 in earnings, but just be interested in the sensitivity for '13.
Joseph W. White: Carl, it's Joe. I honestly don't recall. We haven't looked since the close of second quarter. I think it closed the second quarter, that would have been substantial. I think it would've been $20 million or so, just a guess.
Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Sorry, $20 million as a guess for the year, or for a specific quarter?
Joseph W. White: I think it was just for those first 2 quarters.
Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just for the first 2, okay.
Joseph Mario Molina: Carl, this is John. Be careful because we are getting some rate increases in October and in January that are going to help the overall profitability of the California plan, as well as we have seen, I think, some pretty good strides in utilization management as we now have over a full year with the ABD's enrollment. We've always talked about taking an era from 2 to 3 quarters to get utilization in line. I think in California, it took a little bit longer because when the ABDs were enrolled, we had less flexibility to change treatment regimens. And so we're now 15 to 18 months down the line, we're able to do some managed care, these patients were able to bring, some of the utilization are more in line.
Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then another question just on the difference between your agreement and HealthNet. I think you said yours was 3 years in length versus theirs was 7 years. Any difference in the rationale versus the answer to Chris' question?
Joseph Mario Molina: I'll take that one. I've always said that I was not a big fan of this type of agreement because what it leads us doing is holding a receivable from the state of California, and I'm the kind of guy that likes to have my money upfront. So we did negotiate to have a shorter period of time for this agreement. I think if you look at the deals, though, they are otherwise very, very similar. The magnitude of the settlement that we have is smaller than HealthNet's because our Medicaid enrollment back in the early 2003, 2004 era was smaller, and we had just insured time period. But otherwise, I think it's pretty much the same agreement.
Operator: And our last question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, sounds like we lost Matt.
Operator: Yes, and we have no further questions at this time.
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, I want to thank all of you for joining us. We will be having another Investor Day, I believe, in February. And again, it's uncharacteristic of me, but despite the prior period development in Texas, I am optimistic about the prospects. I think we've done a good job of bringing down medical care costs, and we've got huge growth opportunities in front of us. So we look forward to seeing what 2014 brings. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

Joseph Mario Molina: Thank you, Juan José. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining our discussion today. We had a good second quarter. We had revenue growth of 8%, a medical care ratio that declined 830 basis points and net income from continuing operations that increased to $16 million, up from a net loss of $33 million this period last year. While the highlights for this quarter was the year-over-year improvement in Texas, we have also benefited from improved operational performance at most of our health plans. In fact, the medical margin improved at all of our health plans except for California. John will talk in more detail about our financial results during his remarks. For now, let's focus on growth. We were pleased that the budget signed by California Governor Brown included funding to expand Medicaid coverage to more than $1 million low-income people in California. The expansion is anticipated to begin in January of 2014 and as part of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Funding the expansion confirms California's commitment to expanding Medicaid, as well as Molina's opportunity for additional enrollment growth. We see another opportunity for growth at our New Mexico health plan as we assume Lovelace Community Health Plan's contract for the New Mexico Medicaid Salud! program. The agreement will facilitate the transition of Lovelace's Medicaid members to the Centennial Care Program in New Mexico, a program in which Molina is 1 of 4 participating managed care organizations. The transaction is expected to close August 1, 2013, when Lovelace's Medicaid members will become members of Molina Healthcare. The Centennial Care program is the new name for New Mexico's Medicaid program beginning January 1, 2014, and will provide health care to about 735,000 New Mexico residents. Lovelace currently serves approximately 84,000 Medicaid members, while Molina's enrollment in the state this quarter was 92,000. Next, I would like to take a moment to talk about the latest information we have regarding the Dual Eligible programs in California, Illinois and Ohio. You're probably aware there are often delays associated with the implementation of new contracts or programs. These delays are common. And as we have seen across various state Medicaid programs, the implementation dates are always subject to change. In California, the Dual Eligible demonstration program will now begin sometime on or after January 1, 2014. In Illinois, the implementation for the Duals contract is January 1, 2014. In Ohio, the Duals contract will start voluntary enrollment on March 1, 2014. We continue to make preparations to be ready to provide care for our future Dual Eligible members. Preparations are also underway for additional expected future growth in California. In May, Covered California selected Molina Healthcare as 1 of 13 health plans that will participate in the state's new health benefit exchange program. Molina Healthcare will participate in 4 counties where we currently operate as a health plan: Los Angeles, San Diego, Riverside and San Bernardino. Our offering of marketplace plans is competitive in pricing and supported by a strong provider network. We look forward to welcoming new members as well as ensuring continuity of care for our existing Medicaid members in the event that their eligibility changes requiring them to access health care through the marketplace. The second quarter was another positive quarter for Molina Healthcare. Our strategic and operational initiatives at the health plans have been successful, as evidenced by the significant improvement that continued into this second quarter. With half the year now behind us, we are excited about the future and focusing our efforts on the pipeline of upcoming opportunities. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John.
John C. Molina: Thank you, Mario, and hello, everyone. As Mario said, the second quarter was a good quarter for us. We can point to improved financial performance at 8 of our 9 health plans, including a substantial turnaround in both Washington -- excuse me, Wisconsin and Texas. Before I go further, though, I'm going to help you better understand why we are now presenting results from continuing operations as a separate line item on our income statement. Our Medicaid contract in Missouri expired June 30, 2012, and effective June 30, 2013, all transition obligations associated with that contract terminated. We also abandoned our equity interest in the Missouri health plan during the second quarter. We now present Missouri operations, including the tax benefit of about $9.5 million that we recognized on the abandonment, as discontinued operations. Missouri operations have also been reclassified to discontinued operations for all prior periods. The breakout of discontinued operations should make it easier for you to understand our financial performance. Other than the tax benefit I mentioned, there has been no material financial activity related to the Missouri health plan in 2013, nor do we expect there will be any material activity for the Missouri plan for the rest of the year. The 2013 guidance we have shared with you during the year and the guidance we are sharing today has not included any impact from Missouri. Therefore, income from continuing operations is the best metric by which to measure our financial performance and is, I believe, consistent with how analysts have developed their models of our financial performance. Thus, our earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $0.34 is a good metric to measure against the net loss from continuing operations of $0.71 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year. Let's look at the second quarter in more detail. Premium revenue in the second quarter grew to $1.5 billion, representing an 8% increase over the same period last year. The increase in premium revenue was due to membership growth in Washington and Wisconsin and rate increases in Texas and Washington in the second half of 2012. Our consolidated medical care ratio decreased to 86.2% in the second quarter of 2013 compared with 94.5% in the same period last year. While margin improvement in Texas was significant, stable inpatient utilization and lower pharmacy costs across the company were also important factors in our improved financial performance. I want to point out that 7 of our 9 health plans had lower medical care ratios in the second quarter of 2013 than in the second quarter of 2012 and 8 of our 9 health plans had higher medical margins in 2013 than in 2012. As Mario mentioned, our success in the other health plans has not been matched in California. While performance in California has been helped by a retroactive rate increase that we recognized during the first quarter of 2013, we do not believe the rates adequately reflect the cost associated with the benefits that we are required to provide to the aged, blind and disabled population. Now let me discuss another housekeeping issue. Medical margin is a metric that we have not talked about in the past but I think will be an important measure for the future. By medical margin, I mean the total dollar -- total amount of dollars from premium revenue excluding premium taxes remaining after we pay our medical care costs. The medical care ratio measures performance as a percentage while medical margin measures performance in dollars. As we take on members with more complex health care needs, we are also earning higher premiums for those members. States have realized that some administrative costs do not grow commensurately with the complexity of the patient needs. Therefore, states are increasingly setting premium rates that incorporate economies of scale on the administrative side. The result is higher medical care ratios for our members needing more complex medical care. Remember, though, that these members come with much higher premiums so the total dollars, what we call medical margin, that is left over after we pay for medical care is often higher than it would be for our traditional members. Medical margin then is often a better metric for measuring financial performance related to these members than the medical care ratio. In the future, we will be assuming responsibility for a growing number of individuals requiring complex care. So I'm spending time today to familiarize you with this metric, which will be increasingly important for the proper measurement of our financial performance as we go forward. While we may experience a higher MCR, more importantly, we may be more profitable on a dollar basis. Now let's talk about general and administrative expenses. These expenses increased during the second quarter of 2013 to 10.1% of total revenue compared with 8.5% of total revenue in the same period last year. Partially driving this increase is a provider settlement of approximately $3.5 million recognized this quarter. This settlement reduced earnings from continuing operations by about $0.04 for the quarter. Most of the increase in G&A, which we have talked about before, is a ramp up in administrative expenses as we make the necessary infrastructure investments to support Duals and marketplace program implementations without any offsetting revenue. Moving now to non-cash items. We recorded in the second quarter a one-time, non-cash charge of $3.9 million related to warrants issued in conjunction with the company's convertible senior notes offered in February of 2013. The warrants were reclassified to equity during the second quarter resulting in a mark-to-market adjustment that reduced earnings from continuing operations by about $0.08 for the quarter. No further mark-to-market adjustments are required. At our Investor Day in February of 2013, we talked about alternative financing options, including a potential sale leaseback transaction for our corporate offices. In June, this transaction became a reality as we completed a sale leaseback transaction valued at $158 million. You may recall we have paid approximately $90 million for both buildings. As part of the sale leaseback transaction, we sold our principal corporate offices in Long Beach, California, as well as an office building in Columbus, Ohio and entered into a 25-year lease arrangement for those same properties. We consider the sale leaseback transaction as a financing mechanism through which the company borrows $158 million for 25 years with an implicit interest rate of approximately 8%, which is an interest rate consistent with the market for a 25-year debt. The debt obligation, which is self-amortizing, provides a benefit of not requiring a lump sum payment of principal at maturity. The buildings themselves remain on our books, so depreciation and amortization will continue as it was before the transaction. This sale leaseback transaction, together with the senior convertible notes that we issued in February, increases our cash on hand, providing us with greater flexibility to fund future organic growth as well as strategic acquisitions like we did in New Mexico. As of June 30, 2013, the company had cash and investments of approximately $1.5 billion. Days and claims payable remain flat at 38 days when compared to the first quarter of 2013. Finally, the company announced that it expects net income per diluted share from continuing operations to be $1.55 for all of 2013 and net income per diluted share, including discontinued operations, to be $1.72 for all of 2013. As I noted a few minutes ago, income from continuing operations is the best metric with which to measure our financial performance. The back half of the year will be affected by a number of items. In the third quarter, these items will be: rate decreases in Ohio effective July 1; rate increases in Texas effective September 1; potential pent-up demand associated with the transfer of members from the Lovelace Community Health Plan to Molina Healthcare in New Mexico; potential pent-up demand associated with the statewide service area expansion in Ohio, which became effective July 1; increased payments for personal attendant services and adult day care in Texas effective July 1. And items affecting the fourth quarter or the entire back half of the year include: potential rate increases in California and Michigan effective October 1; continued infrastructure spending for marketplace, dual enrollment, Centennial Care and the Florida long-term care program; interest expenses associated with our recently completed sale leaseback transaction; anticipated effective tax rate on continued -- continuing operations for all of 2013 of approximately 45%. You will recall that the guidance of $1.55 per diluted share, which we issued previously for 2013, did not include certain administrative expenses associated with membership growth related to the marketplaces, Medicaid expansion and some Duals initiatives. At the time we issued our original guidance, we said we would update guidance at a later date and take into account these additional expenditures. Due to our improved operating outlook for the rest of 2013, I'm happy to report that we've been able to include these costs in our revised guidance without lowering our target EPS. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Justin Lake with JPMorgan.
Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: First question is on the California exchanges. So the rates are out there. You look like you're competitively priced in a number of markets. Just wanted to get your impression in terms of how you're positioned there, what you're thinking in terms of what '14 membership might look like there and margins.
John C. Molina: Justin, we're not going to talk about 2014 in terms of membership or revenue or anything like that. We'll do that when we issue 2014 guidance. But we are pleased with where we came out in terms of pricing. We're the second lowest silver plan, which is where we want to be.
Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. Maybe I can ask 1 or 2 other questions then. First, on premium taxes. One of your peers indicated that there could be some issues in terms of getting the deductibility or the non-deductibility of premium taxes back from the states in terms of Medicaid rates. So essentially, they would get the tax itself or the fee passed through but the nondeductibility could be problematic. Are you -- how do you feel about that right now in terms of that issue?
John C. Molina: Our position is that in order for the rates to be actuarially sound, we got to have the premium tax covered. And to the extent that there's a difference because it's not tax-deductible, it's got to be grossed out.
Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And do you feel like states see it that way as well, you're having those conversations, and do you expect to get that?
John C. Molina: We're having those conversations. We know that there are a number of trade groups that are also writing letters to the Medicaid directors, explaining the issues to them. But as of this time, we have not started rate negotiations relative to the ACA tax.
Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. Last question, just on SG&A. How should we -- I mean, SG&A was clearly a little bit higher in the second quarter, you are making investments there. How should we think about that in terms of that run rate into the back half of the year?
John C. Molina: I think that for the back half of the year, that will probably be in a stable point. And then as the revenue starts coming in, in 2014, it starts going down. But right now, I would expect the dollar amount spent for the back half of the year to be about what it is for the first half.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Following on the exchange discussions here, there's been some talk this earnings season around exchange risk adjusters lowering PMPM to what one of your competitors described as a challenging level if you end up with a very healthy book of business. And whether or not healthy members, even if they receive a subsidy, might be more attracted to bonds level plans with their 0 premiums, especially if they only plan to use this as a catastrophic coverage or default on paying their out-of-pocket expenses. So Molina has the lowest premiums for bronze in San Bernardino, Riverside and the second lowest in LA, and I was just wondering if you could speak to whether or not you see that scenario as a potential risk and if you guys are considering any additional reinsurance beyond what's in the 3 Rs.
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, Sarah, this is Mario. We're pretty happy with where we came out in the pricing. And I think in terms of speculating as to whether it's good or bad or what the enrollment is going to look like, it's really too soon to tell. I mean, I don't think anyone has any idea how this is going to turn out. We can look at what happened in Massachusetts, but for the most part, we really don't have very much information. We're just going to have to see how things turn out.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then maybe an update on your discussions with California as far as a potential settlement might go. I thought you guys were pretty far along in that process but no word yet. So just wondering if you could speak to an updated timeline on that or any information on what the cause of it taking so long might be.
John C. Molina: Well, the saga continues, and we're actually thinking of turning this into a miniseries.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Got it. So no final meeting in sight or planned on that?
Joseph Mario Molina: Not yet. We continue to have discussions with the state.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I think I want to follow-up on a miniseries that you guys are embarking on here. Has your attitude changed around whether or not you think that arrangement with the state around Medicaid margins would be attractive?
Joseph Mario Molina: No, we're continuing to pursue the settlement.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, so it sounds like it's more on the state side in terms of timeline as opposed to any change in what you guys are trying to do?
Joseph Mario Molina: I think part of the problem right now, Josh, is that we've just come through the budget season. And so we've had people on vacation, so we -- discussions have gotten stretched out.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: All right. So season finale is still pending, I guess.
Joseph Mario Molina: Correct.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Maybe we could talk -- one just quick one on cash flow. Were there any timing issues in the quarter that impacted the cash flow?
Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking. There were a couple of issues with just 2 states, California and Wisconsin, paying a month later, presumably as a result of their fiscal year ends. But we collected a bunch of cash in July in those 2 states that we'd have normally collected in June.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Do you happen to know what the total on those 2 payments was, Joe?
Joseph W. White: North of -- I'll have to dig that out and get back to you. It was pretty much a standard monthly payment.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got you, okay. And then just last question on the California Duals, as you're thinking about the opportunity, implementation, et cetera, you got a little bit more time, obviously, you got to spend in front of that. But any updates in terms of what you think share could look like next year? I know you're not giving guidance for '14 but maybe some parameters about how we should be thinking about how the Duals end up enrolled.
Joseph Mario Molina: I'm sorry, Josh. I didn't understand your question. Can you say that again?
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Dual -- California Dual membership in 2014. Basically, I'm looking for how we should think about the members rolling on and any parameters we should think about in terms of sizing the opportunity for you.
Terry P. Bayer: This is Terry, Josh. We do know that we won't get all the memberships at once, that it will be phased in as we experienced with the SPD, so it will be rolling in each month. But what we don't know, and I don't think anyone knows, is how many of these Medicare members may choose to opt out. They have the right to opt out. The Medicaid portion would stay with us, but otherwise, we don't know.
John C. Molina: Josh, this is John. I'll just refer you back to the last presentation we did when we talked about this. We haven't seen anything other than the delay that would suggest that those numbers are far off.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, so you're sticking with that, just let's think more about Jan 1 first [ph].
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Just wanted to come back to some of the comments about you maintained $1.55 despite all the incremental investment spending. Can you help us think about how much incremental spending there is relative to the prior $1.55?
John C. Molina: Incremental spend for the buildup is probably going to be about $10 million to $15 million.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay, even that -- I mean given where the G&A came out in the quarter, that -- is there anything else that would have increased the run rate relative to the first quarter that would be notable?
John C. Molina: Chris, let me back up. Maybe I misunderstood your first question. Are you asking in the fourth -- excuse me, in the back half of the year?
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: So in the back half of the year -- when I think about the investment spending that you need to prepare for next year, that wasn't in your prior $1.55, and you said earlier that you're maintaining $1.55 despite this incremental spending. I'm trying to figure out how much incremental spending is now in your current guidance.
John C. Molina: Okay, I'm sticking with that $10 million to $15 million.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And then I wanted to just understand, when you thought about your prior guidance of $1.55 and some of the charges that ran through this quarter on the litigation expense and the charge related to the warrants, was that in the prior $1.55 as well?
John C. Molina: No, it was not.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And -- just wanted to clarify. So I think you said the warrant cost or the mark-to-market was $0.08 in the quarter and that would imply something different, I believe, than the $3.9 million or a little bit above that.
John C. Molina: No, it's because it's not tax deductible.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.
Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: First question, just on reserve development. It looks like you had some pretty substantial gross reserve development of around $50 million in the second quarter. Did you reestablish all of that? Or did any of that accrue into the second quarter earnings?
John C. Molina: No. Right now, Scott, the data in claims table being flat. Also, we're pretty comfortable with where we are in terms of our reserve range. So we would say that we replenished it.
Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. Then just second question. Can you just update us on, again, the Ohio rate cut in the third quarter and then the Texas rate increase, what sort of those final estimated numbers are?
John C. Molina: We have not quantified -- we're not going to go into that level of detail in terms of the Ohio and the Texas rate increase. The Texas rate increase is effective 9/1. In Ohio, the rate decrease is partially based on changing to the risk adjusters. They reset the risk adjusters back to 1 for the third quarter. I think it was in large part because they want statewide contracts. We had a risk adjustor that was higher than 1, so that is effectively a rate decrease for us.
Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And that puts you on a really nice MLR in Ohio in the second quarter, 79.8%, was that benefiting from some of the -- where the risk adjusters were or were there some other factors that drove the really strong underwriting margins in Ohio in the second quarter?
John C. Molina: I think that the risk adjusters are part and parcel with some of the benefits and some of the medical margin that we talked about. Because the risk adjustor do help keep the premiums higher because we have a population that's perceived to be higher costs. They've done a nice job in provider contracting and utilization management in Ohio, which helps keep the medical care costs down.
Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. Then just one last question. It sounds like invitations to negotiate have been sent out recently to the plans for the Florida Acute Care re-procurement. I'm just wondering whether you can confirm that Molina did get one of those notifications or invitations to negotiate?
Joseph Mario Molina: Yes. This is Mario. We did get invited to negotiate, but we're not going to comment further until those negotiations are completed.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Can you talk a little bit about the Lovelace transaction and kind of how you think about the benefits of entering into that transaction? I guess, it sounds like you made at least some payment for this. I know you expect some integration costs or potentially pent-up demand in the second half of the year. But how are you thinking about the ability to retain that membership heading into next year when the new contracts come in place?
Joseph Mario Molina: This is Mario. This is a really nice transaction for us. We have a very high degree of overlap with the Lovelace provider network, including the hospitals. So what we see is a pretty seamless transition for the members, and we think that we should be able to retain a large percentage of the membership and maybe even grow that membership in the back half of the year. So -- and at the same time, there will be some administrative cost savings. So we think this is a pretty good thing for us, it's a good thing for the members, and I think it's a good thing for the state because it promotes continuity of care.
John C. Molina: And Kevin, this is John. Just to remind you, as we've seen with a lot of other acquisitions that we've done, there's often pent-up demand in the first couple of months because as 1 contract sort of rolls out, providers are reluctant to provide a lot of services for fear of not getting paid, the patients are concerned of getting into new aspects of care until they get the new health plan, et cetera. So we would not be surprised to see medical care costs for the membership that transitions to Molina be higher than it was historically for a few months, which is why we highlighted that when we talked about our guidance.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And because of that dynamic, do you expect that this has any impact, positive or negative, on your guidance when you think about your Q1 guidance versus your Q2 guidance now?
Joseph Mario Molina: We don't think it has a negative relative to the full year guidance, but we do think it will have a slight drag in Q3. But then once we get through the pent-up demand, if any, we hit the latter part of Q3 and Q4 very well.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then when you outlined the growth initiatives that were out there for you, I don't think you mentioned California bridge program. How do you think about that opportunity?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, we like the California bridge program and we have been enthusiastic about it. But I don't think it's in effect yet, right? This is still something that's being talked about. But we have been promoting this not only in California but in other states as well.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. So way too early to size that or think about that?
Joseph Mario Molina: Yes, I think the authorization was for the state to consider it but I don't think they've actually gone forth with implementation yet.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies.
David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: It's David Styblo, filling in for Windley. I had a question, just want to go back to the guidance and what was included. Kind of when I sized it out, it looks like there's about -- the guidance is absorbing $0.27 of new cost. The $0.12 you guys had spiked out from the one-off, and then it seems like about $0.15 more of incremental spending. Just want to confirm that, that's right. And then second of all, where is the out-performance coming from to absorb that? Is it in the second quarter alone, or something that's more forward-looking for the rest of the year?
John C. Molina: So this is John. So I think the number you scoped out are right. Where it's coming from, I think as we discussed, we got -- 8 of our 9 health plans in the second quarter had higher medical margins in Q2 versus -- Q2 of 2013 versus Q2 of 2012. We did also beat expectations for the first quarter. So underlying performance in the health plans is improving. California continues to be a laggard, but we think that additional efforts in California plus what we expect to be maybe a rate increase in California in Q4 will help improve California's performance. So really it's the underlying performance in all the health plans that's carrying us into the back half of the year with better expectations.
David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. That's actually a great transition. I'm going to ask about California. One of your competitors mentioned that they're getting a rate increase. Curious what sort of color you have on the rate increase that you might be getting, if you have one or if that's still in discussions, or if you can size that in anyway, that will be helpful.
John C. Molina: At this point, what we know is the budget that Mario mentioned past in June did include additional dollars for rate increases for health plans. We've also seen some preliminary numbers from the state, and I believe those preliminary numbers maybe on a county level but not plan specific. So until we actually get through the negotiation and the discussion process with the state of California, we won't know exactly what that rate increase is, but all the signs point to rates going up for California.
David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. If I could just squeeze one more in, on the parent cash, if you could provide an update there and just kind of what you are expecting that to roll forward through the year end.
Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking. Parent cash is about $525 million as of June 30. As far as year end, that's a little advance. We're not going to do visibility into that right now.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Can you go over how prepared you feel you are at this point in terms of systems for the exchange business given that, that involves enrolling individuals and collecting premiums from individuals and sending out EOBs and things like that. Can you talk about where you're in that process and how comfortable you are?
Terry P. Bayer: This is Terry Bayer. We're on track. We developed an elaborate plan both for 10/1 when the marketplace enrollment will begin and then 1/1 when we'll begin to serve those members. So our capacity in our health plans is geared up for the care management and network and then the administrative, our build out is occurring according to our plans for the premium billing and collection, et cetera.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And you're developing all of that de novo? Or how are you going about developing that?
Terry P. Bayer: To a degree, de novo, and we'd built on our existing systems and added the new functionality that we needed for the product where it is different from Medicaid.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then just kind of a follow up to the last question regarding the potential for rate increase in California. Is there any way for you to size for us what you think is in the budget for rate increases in California overall, perhaps even it's not at the plan level. Can you talk about where you might be in relation to that? And as we get closer to that, the competitor talked about the rate being maybe adequate and perhaps even seeing a reversal of the receivables being set up. So I'm wondering if it even makes sense for you to want to have the target -- the risk sharing target anymore going forward. Are you still pursuing that?
John C. Molina: Those are 2 separate questions. At this point, I know that we won't speculate on what our rate will be because there are many factors that go into the final rate development, number 1. Number 2, on the rate negotiation -- the rate settlement negotiations that we've been talking about, Mario's miniseries as it were, I think that, that's a good safety net to have. It beats the alternative of continuing to take the state of California to court. And so if we can reach the appropriate settlement, I think it's the right thing to do for the company.
Operator: And the last question comes from the line of Ana Gupta [ph] with Dowling & Partners.
Unknown Analyst: So the questions about the Dual Eligibles. I appreciate you having the medical margin as the metric of choice going forward instead of MLR, it makes sense. I'm just trying to understand who do you think has the competitive advantage on winning these Duals contracts across Medicare and Medicaid. It seems to me like an arms race that is going on. And Washington, as we found out, United and Regence won the contracts, and it felt like the Medicaid incumbents were sidelined to some degree in Florida. Now Humana is coming in with this acquisition of American Eldercare. It seems like it's targeted to Duals. So how do you see this all playing out in the states that still need to make their decisions?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, Ana, this is Mario. We feel very comfortable about this. We think we are very well positioned. We won 3 Duals contracts already, and there are a few more in the pipeline. I also believe that the Medicaid part of this is under -- misunderstood and underestimated. This is really not about managing Medicare patients. The Duals are very different than your typical Medicare beneficiary. And right now, we have a considerable number of Duals, one of the largest populations of Duals under management of any company in the country. So we think we're very well positioned to compete for these patients.
Unknown Analyst: So this is more you think about the reduction in institutional care costs relative to acute care costs? And then how does that play out into how the savings are being split between CMS and the state? And how -- is that part of the reason California continues to be more delayed relative to even states like Illinois which seemed to be behind California at one point?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, there are a number of important components. Certainly, decreasing hospital cost is an important component of this. Pharmacy is a large component of this, but so is long-term care. And the long-term care is more than just institutional long-term care. There are a lot of aspects to that as we'd learn from our experiences in Texas. So those I think are things that play into all of this. As far as why California is behind or ahead or which state is ahead or behind, it has a lot to do with factors behind the scenes between the state and between CMS and also the readiness of the state's infrastructure to handle the contracts. So I don't think we can read too much into that, and things can change over time. So I just want to urge everyone to be patient with the rollout of these contracts. They will come. It will take a little longer than we all thought but I think in the end, it's more important to do it right. And I just want to congratulate our staff on the terrific work they have done in getting ready for these contracts. We've got a couple of readiness reviews coming up here at the very near future, and we feel pretty comfortable about our ability to handle these contracts.
Unknown Analyst: Just one final follow-up on that, again, Mario. On SG&A, do you feel comfortable that what's being baked is consistent with your expectations for what the Duals SG&A load would be? And is there any -- are there any differences by state that concern you?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, I think as John pointed out, the SG&A load in terms of percentage may be a little less than what we've seen on the Medicaid side simply because the premiums are higher. And so I'm not really too worried about the administrative cost load at this point. Okay. Well, thank you, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for this call. It's been a good quarter for us, and I just want to mention in closing that the Dodgers are in first place.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Joseph Mario Molina: Thank you, Juan José. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining our discussion today. We're very pleased with our performance during the first quarter of 2013. The improved financial performance we achieved in the second half of last year carried over into 2013 as we continued to make improvements to our core operations. John will be addressing our financial results in greater details during his remarks. But first, I'm going to talk about a number of positive developments that bear noting. Let's begin with the quick review of events that have taken place since our Investor Day in February. On the dual eligible front, highly-anticipated memorandums of understanding, or MOUs, were signed for Medicare and Medicaid programs in both California and Illinois. Including the MOU in Ohio, this brings to 3 the number of Medicare and Medicaid MOU signed in Molina markets. Intensive efforts are underway across the company as we prepare to serve the new members that these programs will bring. All 3 MOUs have aggregate savings targets at or very close to the CMS rate setting process guidance of 1% in year 1; 3% in year 2; and 5% in year 3. This guidance confirms that the CMS commitment to the success of the Medicare and Medicaid programs by preventing overly aggressive savings targets. Now I will discuss some of the specifics regarding each state's Medicare and Medicaid program. California's implementation of its program, now called CAL-Medi-Connect, will start no earlier than October 2013. Implementation involves a 12-month phase-in period and passive enrollment of Medicare but it does not include an initial lock-in period, suggesting that Medicare beneficiaries will be able to opt out of the program or switch out plans at any time. As a reminder, the enrollment in managed care for the Medicaid portion of the benefits in our markets is expected to be mandatory. While the absence of the lock-in period may result in short-term variability in enrollment, the 12-month phase-in should produce a more orderly implementation by avoiding a one-time major influx of patients and providing more time to educate patients about the new program. As a reminder, the long-term revenue projections that we shared at our last Investor Day assumed that our California health plan will participate in Medicare and Medicaid contracts in San Diego, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Molina currently holds a primary Medicaid contract in each of these counties where 329 -- I'm sorry, 392,000 total eligibles reside. In Ohio, we will participate in that state's Medicare-Medicaid program in the Southwest, West Central and Central regions, where approximately 48,000 dual eligibles reside and where we will compete with one other health plan in each region. Dual Eligible beneficiaries will be able to voluntarily enroll beginning in early June with coverage starting September 1, 2013. After this initial voluntary enrollment period, Ohio will begin passively enrolling dual eligibles in the plans. The schedule for passive enrollment will vary by region, with the Southwest region beginning on November 1, 2013; and Central, as well as West Central, starting on December 1, 2013. Beneficiaries can opt out prior to the passive enrollment and may change plans or opt out of the demonstration at any time. In Illinois, Medicare-Medicaid plan passive enrollment is expected to begin October of 2013 with an effective date of January 2014. As discussed at our most recent Investor Day, we will be serving the Central Illinois region that has 18,000 dual eligible beneficiaries and we will compete in that market with one other health plan. Dual eligible beneficiaries will be able to voluntarily enroll for the first 3 months from October to the end of December. Program implementation also includes a 6-month phase-in passive Medicare enrollment period that includes monthly caps on enrollment. Under the passive enrollment mechanism, beneficiaries will be automatically assigned the plans by the state unless they opt out of the demonstration. Beneficiaries will always have the option to opt out of the demonstration or select an alternative health plan. Our Illinois award also includes extending Medicaid managed care to 13,000 aged, blind and disabled beneficiaries in Central Illinois, as well as 7,000 eligible beneficiaries in East St. Louis. Our Illinois ABD contracts are slated to begin ahead of the duals with expected dates of June 2013 in Central Illinois and July 2013 in East St. Louis. Of course, as we have experienced across various state Medicare programs, the dates are always subject to change and can sometimes be extended. With these significant expansions fast approaching, the decision to raise $550 million in convertible debt in February gives us added comfort that we have additional resources to manage through a period of strong growth. We are now better positioned to fund extra requirements and to manage to the temporary pent-up demands and higher medical costs that we may experience while transitioning fee-for-service patients into managed care. Another recent development involving our fiscal agent services business in Louisiana. As you may recall, in 2011, we received notice that the state intended to award the contract for replacement Medicaid Management Information System, or MMIS, to a different vendor. However, in March of this year, the State of Louisiana canceled its contract award to that vendor. That vendor is currently challenging the contract cancellation. The state has informed us that we will continue to perform under the current contract until the successor is named. Subject to the pending challenge, it is currently uncertain when a new RFP will be issued and, if so, when the award will become effective. If a new RFP is issued, we intend to participate. In the meantime, we will continue supporting the state during this period of transition and we'll closely monitor any developments on this front. Now let's turn to the results of our core health plan business. As I mentioned earlier, the operational results were strong across the health plans and we continue to see improvements despite difficult market conditions in Texas and Wisconsin. At our Texas health plan, we are pleased to have achieved our stated goal to reach financial breakeven by the end of the fourth quarter of 2012. However, I would like to caution investors that, given a variety of problematic changes in Texas over the past year, profitability between the first quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 is difficult. By problematic changes, I'm referring to managed care expansions, rate adjustments and benefit carve-ins that we have highlighted during our previous calls. Now looking ahead in Texas, we believe that the stabilization of that business now enables us to better understand the distribution of services. As a result, we will increase payments to personal attendant services and day activity and health services providers effective July 1, 2013. John will talk about expected financial impact of this increase on our projected 2013 results. Last quarter, we talked about our progress in improving the financial performance of our Wisconsin health plan. We are cautiously optimistic that our Wisconsin health plan is, indeed, turning the corner. Contracting efforts and a small rate increase that became effective in July have led to improved financial performance. Our membership has grown from approximately 46,000 members at the end of the fourth quarter of 2012 to approximately 86,000 members at the end of the first quarter of 2013. Member growth is primarily in Milwaukee and surrounding counties, stemming from UnitedHealthcare's exit from the Southeast Wisconsin. And at this point, it is too early to say what the impact of the additional membership will be on our Wisconsin health plan performance. Additionally, we experienced improved financial performance in this quarter at our Florida and our Ohio health plans. On another front, I'm pleased to announce that we've expanded the size of our Board of Directors at Molina from 8 to 11 members and added Steve James, Daniel Cooperman and Dale Wolf as new independent non-executive directors. Steve James is a former audit partner with Ernst & Young with 30 years of experience, providing accounting, auditing and consulting services to health and managed care companies. Daniel Cooperman is an attorney with the law firm of Bingham McCutchen. He has served as a Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary at both Apple and Oracle. Finally, Dale Wolf served as Executive Chairman of Correctional Healthcare Companies. He also previously served as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of Coventry Health Care. We welcome Steve, Daniel and Dale and look forward to their contributions. In summary, during the first quarter, we solidified the progress we made during the second half of 2012. We strengthened our capital position and we continue to prepare for the opportunities and challenges of the next several years. I would now like to turn the call over to John.
John C. Molina: Thank you, Mario, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported net income of $30 million or $0.64 per diluted share compared to $0.39 per diluted share reported in the first quarter of 2012. We are also increasing our previously issued guidance to reflect improvements in anticipated earnings per diluted share from $1.45 earnings per diluted share to $1.55 for 2013. I will come back to guidance after reviewing the results for the quarter. Overall premium revenue grew to $1.5 billion, representing a 17% increase over the first quarter of 2012, mainly due to a shift in member mix, resulting from the growth in our aged, blind and disabled, or ABD programs, which generate higher premium revenue per member. Pharmacy benefit expansion at the Utah health plan and the inclusion of inpatient and pharmacy benefits at our Texas health plan also contributed to our revenue growth. Medical costs were higher during the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to the shift in patient mix associated with the growth in our ABD patients, as well as the benefit expansions that resulted in higher revenue in Texas and Utah. More importantly, our medical care ratio decreased to 86% when compared to 88% in the first quarter of 2012. The main drivers for the decrease in medical care ratio included retroactive rate increases for the California health plan and increased margins at the Texas health plan, as well as stable inpatient utilization. As it relates to rate adjustments in California, you will recall from previous conference calls that we've been reserving a portion of premiums received every month since July 2011 for the premium impact of the provider cuts called for by California Assembly Bill 97. This quarter, we received confirmation from the State of California that it would not be seeking to recover those amounts. As a result, we recognized premium revenue previously reserved at the California health plan, which contributed approximately $18 million to pretax income or $0.24 per diluted share related to 2012 and 2011 periods of service. In Texas, although the quarter reflects significant improvements to margins compared to last year, a year-over-year comparison is made difficult by significant programmatic changes implemented by the state. Among these changes were the expansion of Medicaid managed care into newer higher-cost regions; the extension of inpatient and pharmacy benefits carved into health plans; and a 4% rate increase, which was effective September 2012. All of these changes occurred after the first quarter of 2012 but before year-end. During the first quarter of 2013, we also recognized 2 out-of-period accounting adjustments that resulted in a lower reported medical care ratio from the Texas health plan. First, there was a $6 million out-of-period benefit related to performance measures for fiscal year 2012. Second, a $14 million benefit from favorable development of claims liability established for the health plan at December 31, 2012. Absent these adjustments, our medical care ratio in Texas would have been approximately 86.6%. General and administrative expenses were flat quarter-over-quarter. However, as Mario mentioned, the company issued $550 million of cash convertible senior notes in February of 2013. The coupon on these notes is 1 1/8%. The issuance resulted in a recognition during Q1 of approximately $6 million in debt issuance fees recorded as part of interest expense. The remainder of those issuance fees will be expensed over the 7-year life of the notes. In addition to providing greater flexibility on statutory equity requirements, issuance of the convertible notes also provides a payoff vehicle for our convertible notes issued in 2007, which mature in 2014. As of March 31, 2013, the company had cash and investments of approximately $1.6 billion. Our parent company had cash and investments of approximately $450 million. As I mentioned earlier, in light of our strong first quarter results, the company is increasing its previously issued guidance from $1.45 to $1.55 in diluted EPS. We believe the increase to our 2013 guidance of $0.10 per diluted share is a reasonable estimate in response the positive operating improvements we're seeing across-the-board, balanced by other factors that we anticipate will affect us during the last 3 quarters of the year. These factors include an increase in payment to certain providers in Texas that Mario mentioned and higher performance-based equity compensation. As Mario mentioned, we will be increasing payments to certain providers in Texas effective July 1, 2013. We expect these payments will increase medical costs during the second half of 2013 by approximately $10 million or $0.13 per share. Like we discussed in our proxy statement, the company will be increasing its performance-based equity compensation. As a result, we expect to incur approximately $13 million or $0.17 per diluted share of additional performance-based compensation. We believe that performance-based equity grants better align management with a long-term interest of investors. Again, both the payment of the increases in Texas and the performance-based equity compensation are included in our revisions to guidance of $1.55 EPS, as we are -- now have better visibility into those items. However, there are still a few items that are excluded from guidance. For example, we have also noted that certain administrative costs associated with membership growth related to the Affordable Care Act in various state duals initiatives were not included in our original or our revised 2013 guidance. Guidance still excludes these costs due to a lack of current visibility and so the size of membership and the exact timing of the expected dual enrollment start dates. As we learn more, we will update. We also anticipate that at some point in the near future, we will reach resolution with the California Department of Health Care Services on our other rate disputes in California associated with premium rates dating back to 2003 and 2004. However, we currently do not have enough information to predict the financial impact of any settlement. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I guess just a first real quick one. Just to be clear, in terms of the guidance of $1.55, is that going off the assumption of the $0.64 number in 1Q?
John C. Molina: Yes, it is, Ralph. And again, what we wanted to do here is provide a balance for a better underlying operating results, some one-time benefits and some of the additional charges that we know are coming in for the balance of the year.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then I guess I just wanted to -- I was hoping you could help me deal with some more context around the Texas provider payments. Some more details on exactly who that's going to and just the rationale around that.
Terry P. Bayer: This is Terry Bayer. We are making a payment adjustment in the form of an increase to both the traditional caregiver providers, the personal attendant services and then the adult day health. Those are the 2 categories, chiefly. There may be some additional homecare providers as we go through the details. And the rationale is simply a better understanding of our underlying service bases and the cost structure on the plan. Last year, we were hit with a significant enrollment when we first started out and we wanted to be very cautious as to how we spent the revenue we were given by the state. And as the rate increase came in and our experience gained, we were able to make an increase.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And if I could sneak one more in. Maybe just an update on where you stand in terms of the exchanges, how much you would expect to participate? How your negotiation with providers is going and the rate you expect to get?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, Ralph, this is Mario. We do intend to participate in exchanges in those states where we have Medicaid contracts. We're making good progress. I think the provider contracting is going fairly well. And we anticipate being ready to participate in those programs on time.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I want to ask the same question, just maybe getting back to Terry on the Texas providers. So I understand you have a better understanding of your cost structure and you got the rate increases. But what's the business rationale? Were you having trouble keeping docs in the network? And were there access issues or why -- sort of why not just wait until, I don't know, the end of the year or something for annual negotiation?
Joseph Mario Molina: Josh, this is Mario. It's a combination of things. First of all, as we have a better understanding in the patterns of utilization now, we can see where the costs are. The other problem is that in some of those -- in some cases, we are actually paying providers more than what they would've been paid under Medicaid. So we're trying to come back to a more rational payment system that more fairly compensates the providers for what they're doing and aligns with traditional patterns. So it's really a function of the experience that we've gained over the past year. We have plenty of providers. In fact, I think, we probably have more homecare providers now than we did a year ago, so getting more contractors has not been a problem.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So is it more you were denying certain requests for home health and now you're expecting a higher level of utilization of those services and that's what that's selling to or...
Joseph Mario Molina: No, I think it's more the case of getting it all rightsized. Again, as I pointed out, in some cases, we're actually pretty providers too much; other providers may have been paid too little. Now that we see where the actual utilization is, we can adjust the payments accordingly and that's what we're doing.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. I guess next question, any progress in terms of discussions with the state in California around a potential deal, sort of like what HealthNet did with their Medicaid program.
Joseph Mario Molina: Yes. Our next meeting to negotiate with the state is scheduled in about 3 weeks.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. Do you would expect -- is that meeting in terms of you would expect some resolution at that point? Or is that just another in the series of meetings?
Joseph Mario Molina: I think we're very close to getting a resolution.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. Got you. And just last question. On MMIS, I know it's a tough quarter in the fourth quarter. Do you guys have an operating income number for that segment in the first quarter? I know you don't break it out in the press release anymore.
Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking. You can lift it from -- it was what we expected, pretty much. You can lift it from the -- you can lift it from the income statement. It's a revenue of about $50 million, expense of $40 million, so about a $10 million operating revenue.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: All right. So that's actually a lot...
Joseph W. White: Observing the service revenue percentage.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So that's a lot better then, right? I mean, I think you guys had $8 million or so last year in the first quarter and then $0.5 million or so in the fourth quarter and so, sequentially, were up to $10 million?
Joseph W. White: Well, fourth quarter, remember, was hit by a lot of -- fourth quarter was hit by a lot of one-time charges. I think overall, we're expecting, if you were to remove those fourth -- and we went through this in guidance in New York, if you were to remove those fourth quarter charges from 2012, we're going to see a little bit lower performance in 2013, just getting some contract changes. But it's, suffice to say, it's moving along just like we expected when we gave guidance back in February.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sarah James with Wedbush.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: I hate to keep going back to this but I'm still just a little bit confused about the voluntary payment increase in Texas. So I'm just wondering if this is just a straight-up unit price increase for what you're paying per hour. Or if maybe there is a shift to a different cost structure here, like a flat per week or per month that you think, in the long run, will benefit you. And I guess what I'm trying to get at from that is also if it is just hourly increase, if you're going to see these personal attendants starting to persuade the people they care for to switch over to Molina and if that may drive some sort of negative selection.
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, again, this is about paying the providers correctly, based on the utilization of services that we're seeing in the distribution. And I don't think that we expect to see any shifts in the patient population. Likewise, I don't expect to see much of a change in our provider network. I think this really reflects having a year's worth of data under our belts. And I think that we made some incorrect assumptions initially when we started paying the claims and we were able to correct those.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Got it. And could you guys update us on the impact of the Medicare risk model update? And how do you see that impacting your payments?
Terry P. Bayer: On Medicare? With the current? Sarah, just sort of flesh out that a little bit more. You mean in terms of the sequestration cuts? Or just in general Medicare advantage pricing?
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: In the updates to the risk scores, United had talked about it being maybe 200 basis points based on their book. WellPoint had said it was closer to -- or sorry, United is 250 and WellPoint, 200. So I know it hits every company different based on what the risk scores of your book is and what the health conditions are. So if you guys could just talk a little bit about how you're seeing it working through based on...
Terry P. Bayer: Well, let me just back up. We're not prepared to really quote any direct impact from risk scores. There were some cuts to the Medicare rates by -- as a cause of sequestration and we have passed those onto the providers. That's separate. Now when you start talking about risk scores, we are still submitting additional information to CMS and waiting for information that we will receive sometime in June, which will reset our rates considering our risk course. That'll be a retro back to January and then going forward from July. But we don't yet have the results from our more recent submissions. And by that, I mean, we seek additional information from the medical records to ensure that we've appropriately documented the diagnoses. We get them into CMS and then they award us associated revenue.
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: The California subcontractor relationships that exist between yourselves and other Medicaid plans, have you furthered the conversations with those regarding the duals if that will carry to the dual eligibles? Where does that stand at this point?
Joseph Mario Molina: That issue is currently is ongoing.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: So there's no further view on your part as to whether that will continue or not?
Joseph Mario Molina: Not at this point. We're not prepared to comment any further at this point.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And in terms of the settlement with California. One of your competitors has already done that settlement and then gave them a rate going forward. You talked about settlement regarding historical issues. Do you expect to be paid any amount historically? Or do you think that'll all be resolved, more or less, in a rate structure going forward?
John C. Molina: It's our -- this is John. It's our assumption that the State of California is going to want all the settlements to be on the same construct.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And given that they already have that and have for some time now, almost 2 quarters now, with one of your competitor plans, what is the holdup? Do you perceive their contract to be somehow not as good as what you're looking for? Or does the state want to give you a different contract for some reason? What exactly is the holdup at this point?
John C. Molina: I think the biggest holdup is that there's an awful lot of stuff going on right now at the Department of Health Care Services, trying to do Medicaid expansion, moving with a bunch of the -- to shift members into the Medicaid program, trying to get duals off. So it's more of a factor that they've got a lot of competing priorities, then there's any adverse discussions going on with us.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then just a last question, if you don't mind. Help me out with the math a little bit on the fees on the debt going forward. $6 million this quarter, just a straight 1 1/8% would be like $1.5 million in future quarters. But I know there are some fees and other things that affect the actual expense line. Can you help us understand impact quarterly?
Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking, Peter. We recall the expenses on the offering were about $16.5 million or $17 million. There's a proration of those expenses between the convert and the elements of the call spread. That pro-debt, that's proration. What is assigned to the call spread gets expensed immediately, which is why we mentioned that calling at about $6 million of expenses tied into the -- for fees for the first quarter. So the remaining $11 million -- $10 million to $11 million or so were amortized pro rata over the life of the notes.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Great. That's the only other impact to -- besides the interest itself?
Joseph W. White: Correct.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.
Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: First question, just if you have any updates you can give us on how the conversations are proceeding with the states around the industry tax for 2014 and feedback from the states on how they plan to build that into the rates. Obviously, there's already been a lot of focus on Florida with that, but just interested if any of your other states has given you any feedback yet so far.
Joseph Mario Molina: This is Mario. We have not gotten a lot of feedback on that issue but I think that, perhaps, the best piece of information we have is a letter that was written by the Republican Governors Association, acknowledging that this is a tax that's going to affect state Medicaid programs.
Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. Then just wanted to return just to the Medicare question, I think that Sarah had asked. And I think, Terry, you talked a little bit about the 2013 impacts. But just interested if you've been able to do the analysis, the company's been able to do analysis yet on the proposed change to the risk adjustment model, the HCC model that starts in 2014 with the 75% phase-in, just given particularly some feedback that's been out in the industry about those changes to the risk adjustment model, having a more significant impact on higher acuity members with higher frailty. So just interested if you're thinking there could be a more significant impact to Medicare SNP plans, granted, though, that Medicare is a pretty small amount of your overall revenue.
John C. Molina: You're right. Right now, Medicare is a smaller portion of our revenue and we're still looking at what we think the projected impact will be.
Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. Then just last question. Can you break out what the revenues are that you're accruing from the Louisiana MIS contract? Just interested in what the overall mix of revenues from that contract is relative to the total MIS book.
John C. Molina: I think it's around $35 million a year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carl McDonald from Citigroup.
Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: To help with the -- just understanding the run rate in the first quarter. Was there any impact from the flu? I know it didn't have much of a hit in the fourth quarter.
Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking. Certainly, the external indicators indicate that flu was more prevalent in our parts, at least in our states. I won't say our markets. We saw more TAMIFLU utilization. But overall, we just didn't see anything this quarter that would indicate it was anything out the normal in terms of the flu season. We haven't quantified anything for the simple reason we haven't seen any indication there's a whole lot abnormal to quantify.
Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then it's a smaller market for you, but you talked about in Utah a 16% rate increase. The loss ratio in the market certainly picked up a little bit in the first quarter but not nearly as much as what a 16% rate cut would imply. So just be interested in whether that cut didn't go through to the full effect or if you were able to offset the bulk of it and, if so, how?
Joseph W. White: Well, there's a lot to -- it's Joe speaking. There's -- bear in mind, there's a lot of factors in Utah beyond that Medicaid rate cut, which was -- it was a cut of 16%. Utah has a high percentage of Medicare membership. Among our states, it's the highest with Medicare membership selectivity. And that Medicare business is going to be factored into the MCR you've seen in the financials. We also have a pretty strong, a pretty hard CHIP product there, it's a pretty strong CHIP membership. And lastly, we had the pharmacy benefit carved in this year. And then we relay onto that, I think the team there has done some very good work with patient care that has positively impacted both patient care and medical costs. So I think you have to look at the context of all of those other factors there. And it was a 16% cut but it's -- when you layer it with 3 or 4 other factors, it ameliorated that in the consolidated results.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Baker with Raymond James.
Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: I was wondering if you could update us with respect to your strategy around behavioral health management in light of, over time, you addressing or managing the duals. Trying to get a better sense for whether that will vary market by market, if there are plans, at this point, to insource some of the capability. Just trying to get a general sense of your thoughts on that part of the business.
Terry P. Bayer: This is Terry. Yes, we are insourcing our behavioral health management. And over time, we've been doing that for a number of years as contracts with outside vendors expired. We have recently hired a new physician leader for our behavioral health initiatives company-wide. And we have an overall philosophy on the integration of behavioral and physical health, as well as extensive community-based social support system. So that's the overall philosophy. It will be tweaked state-by-state because there are varying state regulations that often play into the fold, as well as an incorporation of the pharmacy benefit. So in general, insourced and same philosophy.
Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: So can you give us a sense on which markets are still outsourced?
Terry P. Bayer: No.
John C. Molina: And we don't want to provide that level of detail.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I guess it sounds like California, I think, gave the plans, the dual rates, a couple of days ago. I don't know if you had any initial views on those rates.
Joseph Mario Molina: And we received the rates night before last. We're still analyzing them.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. So it's too early to have any kind of initial view on it?
Joseph Mario Molina: Correct.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then I guess you mentioned that the California settlement, the prior period, fortunately, had some costs associated with it. But then you mentioned an ongoing $400,000 benefit per month to premium. Are there any costs associated with that? Or is that a good number to think about as a net number as well?
Joseph Mario Molina: It's Joe speaking. There'll be a small number of costs associated with that, but very small. So we'll keep 80% or 90% of that amount.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then this $0.06 performance bonus related to Texas. So it sounds like Texas has changed the methodology for performance bonus for 2012. Is that change going to maintain in 2013? Therefore, is there a view that, that $0.06 is now recurring? Or are you kind of booking that more normally going forward?
Joseph W. White: No, the state -- it's Joe speaking. The state changed the metrics in 2013. So this will have no impact in 2013.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: No impact in 2013. Okay. And then any update on the Medicaid-Medicare parity for physicians? How are you incorporating that in your guidance? And did that have an impact on your numbers?
John C. Molina: You mean that program that went into effect on January 1?
Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Yes.
Joseph Mario Molina: No. No update yet. We're still waiting for the states to give us guidance on how to pay that and get those state plan amendments done.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. Is that supposed to be a net neutral to you? Or is there an impact either way?
Joseph Mario Molina: It should be, more or less, neutral to us, although because we have to staff model clinics, there may be some positive impact because as we employ these physicians, some of that money will remain with the company.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then last question, just trying to understand the 2 data points that you mentioned as headwinds to the guidance for this year. So if I think about that the Texas provider rate increase, I guess that's about $0.13 this year. But I guess it will be $0.26 for the full year next year? Is that the right way to think about that?
Joseph W. White: All things being equal, that's correct.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Is there any thought that your paying them more might result in a better rate increase, prospectively, and that the net number for next year might be less than the annualized second half of this year?
Joseph Mario Molina: I don't think so. I think the rates are going to be based on utilization and based on risk adjustments. So I don't think paying the providers more is necessarily going to lead to us getting a greater rate increase.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then as far as the executive incentive comp number, it sounded like that only was in place for March. So that $13 million, which might be $0.16, $0.17, that number is going to be more like $16 million next -- for the full year next year?
John C. Molina: It probably depends on when the performance measures are met. And let's face it, if the performance measures are met, that means we're doing a great job with our -- executing our strategic plan. So let's hope that gets fully expensed.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. But I guess all else equals, I mean, assuming you hit it this year and next year, the number next year will be about $3 million higher than the number this year?
Joseph W. White: Well, it's Joe speaking. Those -- the compensation committee, the company revisits those measures and that compensation every year. So it's a little bit premature to speculate on what that would mean for next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Wright [ph] with Monte Press [ph].
Unknown Analyst: Real quick. And I apologize if I may have missed this. But the midyear RSA proposed rate increase in Texas, is that included in the numbers? Or are you going to benefit from that at all?
Joseph W. White: There was a slight adjustment to our rates, Brian, but for the most part, those were targeted at service areas that we don't participate in.
Unknown Analyst: So nothing for Hidalgo then?
Joseph Mario Molina: We're not expecting to see much of a rate increase as a result, no.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Windley with Jefferies.
David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: So I believe that you're continuing to not include in guidance an amount of admin spend to prepare for what I think is Medicaid expansion 2014. I guess I wonder, a couple of things: one, what elements of visibility are you still waiting to get to be able to quantify that; and then, two, is that essentially an onboarding expense that would be somewhat one-time? Or is that a step-up to a higher level of expense for an admin standpoint for that amount?
John C. Molina: This is John. If you recall with our Investor Day, we sort of broke our rate in this class into a couple of buckets. One was just the basic infrastructure that we've got to do regardless. That's setting up the new benefit packages and the IT systems, getting the provider contracts written for things like exchanges, et cetera. And then the other piece was that variable piece, really tied to the membership increases. And it's a latter piece that we don't have great visibility on yet with respect to some of the Medicaid expansions, some of the exchanges or insurance market prices and some with the duals. And these are programs that we think will take flight in 2014. But in a number of our states: Texas; Florida; Ohio; Michigan, we don't know as of today what the Medicaid expansion is going to look like. We don't know if they're going to be ready to start marketing their insurance marketplace in October. So we have the basic infrastructure piece but it's the variable piece that the additional employees that we have to hire to handle a membership that we don't quite know yet. And as soon as we get some information on when these programs are expected to start and how many people they're expecting to cover, we can then adjust our guidance and give you folks additional information.
David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Got it. And so your description, that answers the second part of my question, which is that should be an ongoing expense. Once you ramp that up, that will be in place to service that higher membership.
John C. Molina: Correct. But it will be ramped up because of the higher membership.
David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Right. Right. Coming back to just earnings and wanting to make sure I understand and reconcile some of the pieces. So in the first quarter, the $0.64, relative to Street 25, am I right that about $0.24 is California retro rate? Texas retro is about $0.08? And then on the flip side, your additional carrying costs for debt are about $0.08 as well? Is that pretty close?
John C. Molina: Yes. I've articulated the main sort of one-time items in the quarter. However, as you've listened to our calls, we're really hesitant just to focus on a few one-time items. There's lots of stuff happening in the business, up and down, that we don't point out. So that's why we hate to just look at a quarter isolation and say, "That's a run rate." That's a point, not a run rate.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.
Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: A question on the -- just right back on the earnings trajectory. The $0.08 that you referenced, wasn't that already reflected in the Investor Day guidance when you brought -- when you did the new debt issuance? Maybe...
Joseph Mario Molina: I'm sorry, it's Joe, the $0.08, a portion of it was, yes. We fine-tuned our calculation of expense for the year and I think there's about a -- I think expense recognition for the year is going to be about $3 million, $2 million or $3 million more than we anticipated back in New York.
Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: All right. I get it. I get it. Because it just looks like your outlook for the back 9 months is maybe somewhat conservative in light of some of the margin improvement that you're seeing. And I know you're not giving quarterly guidance but, I mean, is the trajectory going to be sort of $0.20, $0.30, $0.40, as we look ahead? Or is it going to be less sloped?
John C. Molina: This is John, Matt. Again, we had -- we've had a good first quarter. I think the last 2 quarters, what we're seeing is the operational improvements taking hold a bit faster than we anticipated. But the last thing we want to do is start to run ahead of ourselves. And so you know how volatile this business is, so we tried to paint a nice middle path until we get another quarter to it under our belts.
Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Yes, yes. That makes sense. And coming back to the additional provider payments in the back half with -- am I correct in sort of understanding that what you're taking a longer-term view here and you're saying you had these providers who were making up for a very low or, let's say, on the low side unit payments by making it up on volume, if you will. And you're bringing them into a program where they're doing volume in a more appropriate level and you want to pay them more per unit? Is that correct, or partly correct?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, if you recall last year, we made some cuts to the provider payments for the personal attendant services and the day healthcare services. And we also -- so we are restoring some of those cuts, but it's not an exact restoration because the increase in payments is going to more closely match the distribution of the utilization of services. When we set up our payments last year, we made certain assumptions about the utilization of services, which turned out not to be correct. Now that we have a better picture of the pattern of utilization, we are increasing the payments to the providers to reflect the services they're providing. So it is an increase in unit cost but it's also a change in the distribution of utilization in connection with that.
Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. Got it. Okay. That makes sense. And I guess the last question. Anything to note on the longer-term growth pipeline that may have changed from the Investor Day view?
Joseph Mario Molina: No, I don't think so. We continue to think that there is a good opportunity for growth in these Medicare-Medicaid contracts. We think there will be some expansion to Medicaid. It's become more complicated now with the politics that are involved, with governors proposing to increase enrollment and legislators pushing back with this concept of the Arkansas experiment, which we are not in Arkansas and we're not sure how widely that will be adopted. But overall, we still feel confident about the opportunities and the numbers that we've quoted and we're feeling more comfortable about exchanges as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I just wanted to come back to the guidance for a second and the other revision here. And I apologize if I missed it. But there is sort of 5 major items that you guys piped down. The AB 97 of the Texas performance base change, the Texas PPD, then the Texas provider payment in the performance-based comp. Can you -- what was in the prior guidance and what's new?
John C. Molina: The California ABD increase was in guidance. We just didn't have a really good, specifically quarterly, we didn't have it specified in any particular quarter. The increase in the equity comp was not in. The increase in the Texas provider rates was not in. And the -- what was that?
Terry P. Bayer: I think the performance...
John C. Molina: I think the performance was not in.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. So California was in and, basically, everything else was not?
John C. Molina: Correct.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And then, I guess, outside Texas, is there any notable development? Was there any notable development in the quarter?
John C. Molina: Outside Texas?
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Yes.
Joseph Mario Molina: Prior to the development?
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Yes.
Joseph W. White: No, no, it was pretty consistent.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And then I guess last question, somewhat philosophical and then also quantitative in a way. I guess, when we think about the California duals, I guess sort of philosophically, I mean, not being able to sort of mandate the Medicare side of the payment, does that at all change sort of the attractiveness of the market, meaning that you have less ability to sort of manage the overall costs? And then, two, if you exclude the Medicare portion, what do you think that does to rates on a relative basis? I know you don't want to give a sort of specific numbers, but does it drop the rates? How much percentage-wise?
Joseph Mario Molina: I love this. So you're asking us to give you a philosophically quantitative answer.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Exactly.
Joseph Mario Molina: The duals' opportunity in the counties that we're in, in California, is roughly almost 400,000 beneficiaries. There's a huge opportunity. Especially when you compare it to states like Ohio and Illinois where we're also participating. So you see that California really dwarfs most other states and roughly 11% of all the duals in the country reside in California. We have participated in this program as a Special Needs Plan. We're the seventh largest Special Needs Plan in the country by enrollment. And that has all been voluntary. So no, I don't think the fact that they're going to be able to opt out deters us in any way because enrollment in these plans, as far as we're concerned, has always been voluntary. And so our goal is to try to convince the beneficiaries that there is a benefit to them to remain with us. But we've always assumed that, I think in our assumption, about 40% to 50% were going to opt out. So no, I don't think it changes anything.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And then just on the latter part, any way you can directionally sort of guide us if you're expecting $1, if you're getting both portions, what that $1 would be if you're just getting the Caid component?
Joseph W. White: No, Chris. We're still looking at that stuff.
Operator: Our last question comes from Tom Carroll with Stifel.
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: So I jumped on late as well. I apologize. A question on Texas and the favorable development that you said related to the liability, the claims liability that was established at the end of last year. I guess just 2 questions on that. Did all of that support first quarter earnings? And secondly, how much remains on that reserve that you established for future periods?
Joseph W. White: Okay. So Tom, you know how much we love to talk about reserves and roll-forwards. $16 million was what we had accrued -- what we took in the income in Q1 based on the liability we established at 12/31. So that whole $16 million benefited Q1. What we didn't talk about and we have no way to know just yet is how much of excess reserves have we built in as we put in the reserves for Q1. It's always a matter of taking excess out from the past periods and building up the current period. So we don't know to what extent future periods will continue to have a prior-period development in Texas on a favorable basis.
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I guess I'm referring to this -- I'm referring to this [indiscernible] $5 million.
John C. Molina: He's talking about the premium sufficiency reserve we took, I think.
Joseph W. White: No, no, right. It's Joe speaking. I know -- John, to confirm, he's talking about payable prior-period development primes. So Tom, I can't do anything other than reiterate what John said. It was certainly more favorable prior-period development that we typically see in the health plan, hence we've called it out. We try to set the reserves as accurately as possible every quarter. So all things being equal, there would be much less favorable development in future periods.
Operator: That was our last question. I'll return the call back to you, Mr. Orellana, for your closing remarks.
Juan Jose Orellana: Well, thank you for joining us during today's call and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Molina Healthcare Fourth Quarter and Year-end '2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] A quick reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, February 7, 2013. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Juan Jose Orellana, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan Jose Orellana: Thank you, David. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare's financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2012. The company's earnings release reporting its results was issued today after the market closed, and is now posted for viewing on our company website. On the call with me today are Mario Molina, our CEO; John Molina, our CFO; Terry Bayer, our COO; and Joseph White, our Chief Accounting Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call and take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our comments today will contain forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act including without limitations statements regarding our ABD and duals membership in Illinois, growth and enrollment associated with the Medicaid expansion, our projected revenue growth over the next several years, our accreditations and quality ratings, our medical care costs and our financial guidance for fiscal year 2013. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K annual report, our Form 10-Q quarterly reports and our Form 8-K current reports. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab of our company website or on the SEC's website. All forward-looking statements made during today's call represent our judgment as of February 7, 2013, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements except as required by securities laws. This call is being recorded, and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available at our company's website, molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina.
Joseph Mario Molina: Thank you, Juan Jose. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining our discussion today. Let me start by saying that we are proud of our strong fourth quarter operational results, which reflect solid growth in our revenue and considerable improvement in our margins. Our performance in the fourth quarter is a strong finish to 2012, a year in which we successfully managed through a difficult operating environment resulting from margin pressure at our Texas, Wisconsin and California health plans. We are especially encouraged by the traction we are gaining with our operational and strategic initiatives that we have outlined in the past. The overall result was a record year for our company, with revenue totaling $6 billion. In 2012, our company revenue grew by nearly $1.3 billion, while our enrollment grew by an additional 100,000 members. To put this in perspective, our annual revenues have increased by over 50% in the last 3 years, and nearly all of this increase has come from organic growth. As we've talked about during previous presentations, our strategy calls for us to double our annual revenues in the next 3 years. As we begin looking forward at 2013, I thought it would be worthwhile to think back on some of our accomplishments in 2012 and consider the solid foundation on which we can build in 2013. Our health plans in Washington and Ohio had successful Medicaid contract bids. Our Ohio health plan will expand to serve the entire state and was selected to participate in the new contract for the dual eligibles. We helped to transition thousands of aged, blind and disabled or ABD members from fee-for-service into managed care in Texas, Washington and California. We experienced considerable growth in Texas as we implemented new contracts for ABD members in the Hidalgo and El Paso service areas. Our Utah health plan celebrated its 15th anniversary of serving that state's Medicaid program. It was in Utah that we first demonstrated that our business model could be replicated in states other than California. In Wisconsin, we made great progress in lowering health care cost by entering into new contracts with the major hospitals in our network, and we received a premium rate increase. Performance of the Florida health plan has improved as medical cost decreased, resulting from reductions in unit costs and utilization. Illinois is a new market for Molina Healthcare. We're excited to have been selected to serve members in the Central Illinois region. Starting in the second quarter of 2013, we will begin serving seniors and persons with disabilities in the Medicaid program, as the state expands its integrated care program. There are approximately 20,000 ABD patients in the central region. In the fall of 2013, our Illinois health plan will also begin serving duals in central Illinois under the state's Medicare-Medicaid Alignment Initiative. There are approximately 18,000 dual eligible beneficiaries in this region, and Molina Healthcare will compete against only 1 other plan. Our participation in Medicare is now entering its eighth year, and we are now the sixth largest Medicare Special Needs plan in the country. All of our eligible plans have achieved 3 Star ratings. We opened new clinics in California, Florida and New Mexico this year, with more to come in 2013 to supplement our direct delivery footprint, which already included a presence in California, Virginia and Washington. As I've said before, our direct delivery strategy does not replace our contracted physician network. Instead, it supplements access for patients in areas where access to primary care is a challenge. Molina Medicaid Solutions achieved improved financial performance overall. With the CMS certification of our Medicaid Management Information Systems in Idaho in 2012, all 5 of our Molina Medicaid Solutions states now operate systems certified by CMS. In addition, we also attained a 1-year contract extension in Louisiana and were awarded a contract to use our West Virginia system to serve the U.S. Virgin Islands. Next year, in 2014, the Affordable Care Act will continue to be implemented, and with it, expansion of Medicaid coverage to newly eligible beneficiaries. At this point, the governors of California, Illinois, New Mexico, Ohio, Michigan and Washington have announced they intend to proceed with expansion. In those states, expansion could add up to 4.3 million new beneficiaries. Florida, Utah and Wisconsin are still undecided. Should these states elect to expand Medicaid, the potential market could increase by an additional 1.3 million new beneficiaries. Over the next 3 years, we expect to double our annual revenue from $6 billion to $12 billion, while at the same time improving our profitability and enhancing our reputation for quality. We intend to accomplish this through contracts for dual eligible members in the markets we currently serve, and through increases in Medicaid enrollment in our present states. We expect to maintain NCQA accreditation in all states, and it is our goal to achieve 4-star ratings for our Medicare products. For Molina Healthcare, 2012 was a year of opportunity, challenge and validation. As more states moved beneficiaries of government programs into managed care, our experience and track record continued to open new doors of opportunity for our company. We will continue to execute on our strategy and remain true to our mission to bring quality health care services to even more of those who need it most and are least able to afford it. Thank you. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John.
John C. Molina: Thank you, Mario, and hello, everyone. As Mario noted, this year we faced some challenges, but have made great progress, which is reflected in our fourth quarter results. Today, we reported earnings of $26 million or $0.54 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2012, a substantial improvement over the earnings of just $0.07 per diluted share that we reported in the third quarter, and the loss of $0.72 per diluted share for the same period last year. There was a lot of ebb and flow in this quarter: a $12 million benefit from a retroactive rate increase in California, a $30 million benefit from a prior period claims development in Texas, and a $14 million expense for potential settlements. Had we not incurred these items, earnings per share would have been about $0.26 for the quarter. But the real story of this quarter is that we have demonstrated an ability to work with our state partners to get rates right as we increase value by encouraging members and providers to access and provide care in a more cost-effective manner. That's a reassuring message as we prepare for 2013 and 2014. In the interest of time, I'm going to focus on Texas and California, but I want to point out to everyone that 7 of our 9 health plans reported a decrease in their medical care ratios from the third quarter of this year to the fourth quarter of this year. As we've discussed in the past, we usually see an increase in medical care ratios from the third to the fourth quarters. But Texas is, of course, the big story. When we reported results in the third quarter, we felt that Texas was on the right track, but we didn't yet have enough information to be certain. Today, we have that information. With the benefit of the last 3 months of the year, we are now able to review the Texas health plan's performance over the entire 10 months that have passed since the expansion took place effective March 1, 2012. In the fourth quarter, we were able to reap the benefits of our approach to patient care and provider contracting. We also recognized more revenue due to increased premium rates that more closely matched the high costs of our ABD members. The result is that our Texas health plan reported a medical care ratio of $0.78 -- 78% for the fourth quarter, with a benefit of about $30 million of lower medical cost that related primarily to the second and third quarters of 2012. However, to understand the Texas performance in the proper context, we have to assign all revenues and medical costs to their proper periods. When we do that, we can see that the medical care ratio of the Texas health plan declined from 99% in the first and second quarters of 2012 to 90% in the third quarter and 89% in the fourth quarter. This represents solid improvement that gives our shareholders a fair return, while also providing value and quality to the state of Texas. For the fourth quarter, again adjusting for a favorable out of period claims development, the Texas health plan reported pre-tax income up $4 million. We have made good on our commitment to reach breakeven by the end of 2012. While we are proud of our accomplishments in Texas, I want to be clear that we are not going to maintain a 78% medical care ratio you see reported in this fourth quarter. The adjusted medical care ratio of 89% for the fourth quarter that I mentioned a minute ago is a good starting point for 2013. California is another example of where our perseverance has paid off. You will recall that on our third quarter call, we talked about our efforts to demonstrate to the state that higher premiums for ABD members were appropriate. In the fourth quarter, we received a cumulative retroactive rate increase of approximately $12 million for our ABD members. About $4 million of this rate increase related to 2011, while about $8 million related to 2012. So just like with Texas, the medical care ratio of 89% that we reported in the fourth quarter is not indicative of where we are on a run-rate basis. When we push back the retroactive rate increase to the proper time periods, we have an adjusted medical care ratio of 94.5% for the fourth quarter. The situation in California is analogous to our situation in Texas. Our greatest challenge is among our ABD members. After adjusting for a retroactive rate increase in California, we still had a 103% medical care ratio for the ABD members in the fourth quarter of 2012. We did achieve a 10% decline in inpatient utilization between the third and fourth quarters of 2012. This activity, coupled with the rate increase, shows we are making good progress towards improved financial performance. General and administrative expenses grew to 9.7% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2012 from 8.3% in the third quarter. Absent $14 million of expense recognized for potential settlements in the fourth quarter, our administrative expense ratio was 8.8%. We will also continue to make the infrastructure investments necessary to support the growth opportunities we've previously identified. As of December 31, 2012, the company had cash and investments of approximately $1.2 billion. The parent company had free cash and investments of approximately $45 million. Moving on to guidance, a more comprehensive list of guidance components for our 2013 guidance can be found in today's press release. The following are some highlights, and as a reminder, all numbers are approximations: total revenue, $7 billion; medical care ratio, 88%; G&A ratio, 8.6%; income before tax, $128 million; net income, $74 million; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA, $245 million; diluted EPS, $1.55; and effective tax rate, 42%. Let me speak about our tax rate for a moment. Although we have historically experienced and guided to a tax rate of about 38%, we expect that limits in compensation deductions for health insurers as a result of the Affordable Care Act will increase our tax rate. These changes to the Internal Revenue Code apply to all health insurers beginning in 2013. For our 2013 guidance, we estimate that the impact of a change in our effective tax rate from 38% to 42% results in a reduction to earnings per share of about $0.10. I also want to point out to everyone that we are now calculating our medical care ratio by dividing medical cost into revenue exclusive of premium tax. We made this change to allow for better comparability of the medical care ratio between periods for health plans operating in states where premium taxes have changed. Michigan and California reduced or eliminated their premium taxes during 2012. A complete discussion of our assumptions and risk factors associated with our guidance will be discussed at our upcoming Investor Day on February 21. So I would ask that you defer your guidance questions until then. This concludes our prepared remarks. David, we're now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of Sarah James from Wedbush.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: I appreciate all the detail on the California MLR, but I wanted to narrow in on the 103% ABD MLR post the retroactive timing of rate increase adjustments. So when you think about bringing that down, how much progress would be driven by rates versus medical management? And then maybe in terms of inpatient, since that's the metric that you chose to highlight in the prepared remarks, if that went down 10% for the fourth quarter, how much further is there to go until you get to a range you're comfortable with?
John C. Molina: That's a multiple-choice question there. A lot of detail in there, Sarah. I think that we've gone back and talked to the states about the rates again because we think that even though they have looked at rate adequacy, we believe and some other health plans believe that perhaps we're not quite where we need to be in terms of the rates. So part of this may come from additional rate relief. Our medical directors have done a very good job of working on getting utilization down in terms of inpatient. And inpatient for the ABD constitutes, I would say, about 30% to 35% of all medical costs, so we would expect to gain some further decreases because of continued decreases in utilization. 1 month, again, doesn't -- or 1 quarter doesn't make a trend. We also have a new pharmacy contract that took effect January 1 of this year, which we expect will help with those costs as well.
Operator: Our next question today comes from the line of Justin Lake from JPMorgan.
Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just looking ahead, can you talk a little bit about how you see the rate environment shaping up going into 2014 and specifically on the industry tax? Can you tell us any of the conversations you're having with states and your confidence in the ability to pass that through?
John C. Molina: Well, Justin, on the rate environment, we're going to go through a lot of detail in a couple of weeks on the rate increase -- increases or decreases or flat. We think that by and large rates are going to be sort of flat again this year, state budgets are not. They're improving, but still not in great shape. As far as the premium tax goes, I'll let Mario speak to our efforts there, but we have seen some actuarial white papers on other sorts of premium taxes. And since it is a discrete item, we believe there is a very good argument, if it's not repealed, that it is paid for as a discrete line item.
Joseph Mario Molina: This is Mario. We continue to advocate for repeal of the tax. We believe that this excise tax really does not generate new revenue for the government because our premiums are paid for by the government, so you're really just robbing Peter to pay Paul. However, as with other premium taxes we've seen in the past, we expect this to be passed through. So if there is a tax like this, we would expect that the states would increase our premium revenues accordingly, and that's consistent with actuarial practices and our previous experience on premium taxes.
Operator: Our next question today comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Barclays.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Texas. I'm just looking at the change on a sequential basis, and I understand the rates added $9 million and the PPRD was $30 million. So I'm kind of backing into a medical cost improvement of like $3 million, maybe something in the ballpark of $1 million a month of improved medical costs. So I'm curious, did that continue to ramp through the quarter? Is that a decent run rate? Or is this just the tip of the iceberg, and you guys are still making significant changes in that market that you think would improve even further?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, what we said, Josh, was that we're starting at about an 89% medical care ratio for Texas, and we think that, that is a good baseline going into 2013. Of course, we're going to continue to try to work that down. We've made a lot of improvements in terms of our contracts, and we'll continue to work on utilization management to see if we can push that a little bit lower.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg from Susquehanna.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I guess I'm just trying to figure out when I look at the EBITDA guidance for this year of $245 million. If you look at sort of the run rate of below-the-line items, D&A, investment income, rental, interest expense, et cetera, is there some big step-up assumption for 2013 relative to the fourth quarter? Because it looks like the bottom line got --
Joseph W. White: This is Joe speaking. We don't want to go into too much on guidance, obviously, on this call. We'll save that for New York. But fair to say, we've been ramping up a lot of our infrastructure investment in anticipation of entering new markets, which inevitably has been pushing the depreciation line up.
Operator: We'll move to our next question coming from the line of Tom Carroll from Stifel.
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I wonder if we could just walk through some of the moving pieces here. And, John, I think you said if you carve them all out, you get to a $0.26 number for the quarter. So maybe we could just start with your $0.54 reported number and work your way to the $0.26 for me on a per share basis?
John C. Molina: Go ahead, Joe.
Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking. It's really the 3 items John called out to get there. The first item being the abnormally high prior-period development number in Texas of $30 million. There's always a degree of prior-period development, usually favorable in our case. We just call that number out because it's particularly big this time. So you could back that out or you could back out the majority of that, and translate that into a per share basis. And I think it's -- I think on a per share basis, it's about $900,000 pretax equals about $0.01 a share after tax. So you would just back out that $30 million. We talked about the retro rate increase in California of about $12 million for the ABDs in California. About $2 million, or $2 million to $3 million of that relates to fourth quarter. The rest of it is either in earlier parts of 2012 or 2011. So again, you could subtract out $10 million for that. And then we talked about $14 million of accruals related to settlements in that kind of item, which are unlikely to recur. So that would go back the other direction. So if you price all those out at around $900 pretax equals $0.01, you'll get around $0.25, $0.26, $0.27. It's a rough cut, but that'll be -- it's in the ballpark. Did that help? [Technical Difficulty]
Operator: We'll move to our next question coming from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Credit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I was hoping maybe you'd talk about another state. Wisconsin, I think, was a little bit problematic sort of earlier in the year. Can you maybe just talk about what you're seeing in that market at this point?
Terry P. Bayer: Sure. This is Terry Bayer. The story in Wisconsin is not unlike we've shared with you on other states where we've identified higher costs and premium shortfalls. So we embarked on a plan there to renegotiate primarily our hospital contracts, which are major driver of cost, to beef up our utilization management efforts. We brought our behavioral health management in-house in late summer, and we began to see improvement there. And finally, we presented our case to the state of Wisconsin and worked with them very closely to obtain a rate increase that took us in the right direction. So it's very basic. It's not completely over the hill. We've got continuing work to do there on all of those fronts, on rates, as well as on utilization management, but we're in better shape now than we were a year ago. Did that help?
Operator: We'll move on to our next question coming from the line of Michael Baker from Raymond James.
Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: I was wondering if you could give us a sense for how the flu progressed during the fourth quarter and post the quarter how it's trending in the first quarter.
John C. Molina: Sure. I think we tried to scope out and put about -- I think it was $5 million is what we attribute to flu cost during the fourth quarter. As the flu sort of moved out West, we're seeing a bit of a ramp up in January. But again, nothing very significant, nothing materially significant, I would say.
Operator: Our next question today comes from the line of Carl McDonald from Citigroup.
Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I'm going to ask the EBITDA to pre-tax question again. It looks like the -- to make the numbers work, assuming that investment income and interest expense are roughly stable, you'd need to see an increase in the D&A from $64 million this year to over $100 million in '13. Is that the expectation?
Joseph W. White: No, that's not the expectation. I'll have to take a look at that, Carl. I'll have to take a look at that.
Operator: Our next question today comes from the line of Scott Green from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Scott J. Green - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I had a couple of questions, if we're allowed to ask more than 1. First is on the Texas MLR. You talked about 89 being a good base. I'd appreciate your perspective if you've had any communications with the state leading you to believe there might be some sort of off-cycle either rate increase? I know you're in Hidalgo STAR, and Santino has talked about higher cost there. Or maybe some decrease in Hidalgo STAR+PLUS based on changes in your member mix?
Joseph Mario Molina: No, we're not anticipating any off-cycle rate changes.
Scott J. Green - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And secondly, last month you hired a new plan president in New Mexico. Is there any -- does that demonstrate your confidence in being able to win that RFP rebid?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, Scott, we need a plan president there whether we win the RFP or not. So that had nothing to do with it.
Scott J. Green - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And lastly, I had a question on duals. If you've been working in any of your markets to expand your provider network to incorporate maybe more Medicare providers, I was curious if you were able to contract with them on a unit-cost basis that's equivalent to the Medicare fee schedule or maybe lower or maybe higher?
Terry P. Bayer: Scott, this is Terry Bayer. We already operate Special Needs plans in the markets where we are expanding our duals, except for Illinois, which is new. So we have not had any need yet to change any of our reimbursement methodology than what we've experienced in the past.
Operator: Our next question today comes from the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Curious about the status of the subcontracting arrangements for the California Coordinated Care duals program between you and other health plans, have you signed any of those contracts at this point, whether you as a subcontractor or subcontractors to you and your regions?
Joseph Mario Molina: Yes, that's a very interesting question. We have a subcontract relationship in Los Angeles County for the Medicaid program. We have not signed any new or additional contracts with HealthNet, and we're all waiting for further information on how the program is going to roll out in California. So until we have more information, there's not much to add to that other than things remain status quo.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: We're getting kind of close to when we would expect to have actually, sort of, this all taken care of and understanding rates and rolling the program out. Do you believe at this point the contracting will look similar to the way the contracts have been for the typical Medicaid business? Or do you think that there'll be substantial changes?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, I think the first thing we have to see is what the contract between -- for the 3 party agreements going to look like between the state, the federal government and the health plans, and we haven't received that yet. So until we know more about what the underlying contract looks like, I think it's too early to say what subcontracts will look like. But we imagine it's going to simply be an extension of our current agreement with HealthNet.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then just 1 last question, if you don't mind. Can you talk about the Florida long-term care bids? And you were invited to negotiate and didn't end up agreeing with the state. Can you describe what exactly caused you to not agree with the state? Do you think that, that will have any implications for your ability to win Florida business down the road in terms of the TANF business when that is moved to managed care, if that's moved to managed care?
Joseph Mario Molina: Those are under protest right now, and so we can't comment.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: You won't even discuss what exactly the issues are around your protest?
Joseph Mario Molina: At this point because the protest is ongoing, we don't want to comment any further.
Operator: Our next question today comes from the line of Matt Borsch from Goldman Sachs.
Sam Wass - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: This is actually Sam Wass on for Matt. I was wondering if you could give any comments on rate negotiations for your duals contracts in Illinois and Ohio. I was particularly interested in any sort of savings assumptions that might be factored in.
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, we have seen some preliminary numbers, and I think it's safe to say that consistent with what we have said in the past and what we have seen from that -- the savings assumptions are going to be on the order of 1% to 2% in the first year of the program.
Operator: We have a follow-up question from the line of Sarah James.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Continuing on my earlier question of California MLR, you guys mentioned that there was a 5,000 member exit. So what product were those in? What was MLR running on that book, so we can get an idea of how it may have skewed the fourth quarter as opposed to really the run rate?
Joseph Mario Molina: We exited a region in the northern part of Los Angeles County, and the medical costs there were high in large part because there's only a single hospital in the region, and we've had a great deal of difficulty as have other health plans in negotiating with them. This is an ongoing problem in -- especially in rural areas with the Medicaid program. And I hope that in the future we'll get more support from the government, both in terms of the states and perhaps looking at antitrust issues, to prevent certain hospitals from holding health plans hostage. But we had no choice but to exit that region as a result.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: But no specific amount that you're willing to talk about, about how it may have skewed your fourth quarter MLR or what MLR they were running at?
Joseph Mario Molina: We're not going to get into that level of detail.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Then another membership question. In Ohio, you guys had a 28,000-member loss because of eligibility errors or changes. Can you just remind us what that was? And if there's any premium give back associated with that?
Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking. The state had some issues with eligibility that first started surfacing, I think, around July and August. They spent a couple of months fixing it, and they've gotten it fixed now. While there might be a little bit of true-up back and forth, it won't be material at this stage.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We have a follow-up question from the line of Chris Rigg from Susquehanna.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I did want to follow up on the G&A expense. What is the onetime in there? Maybe I missed it, but just some more detail would be helpful.
Joseph Mario Molina: Yes, the G&A, we had a number of settlement issues. They are onetime in nature. They're about $14 million, and we don't expect those things to recur.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: And what's behind the $14 million?
Joseph Mario Molina: Some litigations, prior settlements. Some of this goes back to 2011.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: So it's a bunch of little things or is there 1 charge that makes up a majority of it?
Joseph Mario Molina: No, it's a number of little things, I mean if you can call $14 million little. But it's a number of little things.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Right, right. And then on the Texas -- obviously, that's a fairly big number. And I know obviously it takes time in the claims submittal process to see where things shake out, but I guess is there anything -- I guess what led to sort of the big favorable adjustment in the fourth quarter relative to Q2 and Q3?
John C. Molina: Well, we were pretty conservative in Q2 and Q3 when we did our IBNR reserves. And I think what happened is the changes we made to provider contracts and to some of the utilization management caused those trends to go down faster than what our actuaries predicted, and so that's what the big delta was for.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And then one last follow-up on the guidance, and I know you guys are trying to not talk about it too much, but is it primarily on the D&A side or is there an assumption there on the interest side in terms of raising some money you're earning that, that might be worth highlighting? And we'll leave it at that.
John C. Molina: No, we've talked about a big ramp up that we're going to be experiencing over the next 3 years. And so that's what you're seeing in the D&A. There's nothing in there in terms of interest expense, et cetera.
Joseph W. White: We'll have to talk off-line with people who are having issues getting their -- the model essentially envisions about $20 million of increased depreciation expense over 2012. So I'll have to talk to you about why they're sort of struggling to get to our number.
Operator: And at this time, we have no further questions registered. I'll turn the call back to Dr. Molina.
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, thank you, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call. It's been a good quarter, and we look forward to seeing you in February on the 21st in New York for our Investor Day.
Operator: And, ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect your lines.

Operator: Welcome to the Molina Healthcare Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, October 23, 2012. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Juan José Orellana, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Joseph Mario Molina: Thank you, Chantal. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare's financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2012. The company's earnings release reporting its results was issued today after the market closed and is now posted for viewing on our company website. Participating for Molina today will be Dr. Mario Molina, our CEO; John Molina, our CFO; Terry Bayer, our COO; and Joseph White, our Chief Accounting Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our comments today contain forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act regarding our Texas cost-containment efforts and year-end profitability, our Ohio Duals expansion, our transition of ABD members into managed care at our California, Washington and Texas health plants, our MMS operations and other matters. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K annual report for fiscal year 2011, our Form 10-Q quarterly reports and our Form 8-K current reports. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab of our company's website or on the SEC's website. All forward-looking statements made during today's call represent our judgment as of October 23, 2012, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements. This call is being recorded, and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available over the Internet through the company's website at molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina.
Joseph Mario Molina: Thank you, Juan José. Hello, everyone. Today, we reported earnings of $3 million or $0.07 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2012. We are pleased with the progress we made during the third quarter. Both revenue and enrollment were strong, which bodes well for our company's future as we improve our margins. More importantly, in Texas, we saw incremental improvement this quarter as the implementation of our utilization and unit cost initiatives gained momentum. We are seeing continued stability in our Molina Medicaid Solutions business, and it is making the kind of contribution we expected when we made the acquisition. So let's start with Texas. Since reporting our second quarter results, we have made considerable progress toward achieving our objective of reaching a breakeven run rate by the end of the year. Our medical care ratio in Texas decreased from 109% in the second quarter to 90% in the third quarter. This improvement is even better than the medical care ratio we reported in Texas for the second -- third quarter of 2011. However, we are not yet out of the woods. There is still a considerable amount of work to be done and we must remember that this early success does not constitute trend. The improvement in our Texas medical care ratio was due to the implementation of initiatives aimed at reducing utilization and unit costs. As Terry Bayer outlined at our Investor Day in September, this included changes to contracts with providers to lower unit costs and the implementation of state-required changes to fee schedules. In addition, a blended 4% premium rate increase that went into effect on September 1 also contributed to the improvement. Ohio was also in the headlines this past quarter. Molina Healthcare Ohio was selected to participate in Ohio's Integrated Care Delivery System for dual eligibles. As a reminder, we were awarded the maximum number of regions allowed per health plan and the awarded regions are within our existing service areas. This service area overlap is important during a transition from fee-for-service to managed care. If we assume that premium rates are set adequately to cover medical costs, then having an established provider network and experience in a given market can ease the transition to managed care for members. In addition to Texas, Washington and California are the 2 other states where we continue to transition thousands of ABD members from fee-for-service to managed care. In California, our health plan has experienced a considerable change in our member mix, adding about 20,000 ABD members over the past year and nearly doubling our ABD enrollment. Accordingly, our medical care ratio also increased during the same period because these members require more medical care. The California Department of Health Care Services recently asked for health plan input in a review of premium rates for ABD members. Our California health plan has already provided input in support of that review. In addition, we will be exiting an area in Northern Los Angeles County where there is only 1 hospital and costs are extremely high. We expect this will reduce our enrollment by about 6,000 members, but lead to lower medical costs. In Washington, we added nearly 19,000 blind and disabled members since July of this year. Unlike California, the influx of these members has moderately increased our Washington health plan medical care ratio when compared to the second quarter of this year. Our initial data related to these new members in Washington is promising, but I caution you, the claims data will take some time to develop fully. There are a few developments since our Investor Day presentation that I would like to bring to your attention. On October 12, Governor de Jongh of the U.S. Virgin Islands announced a partnership between the Virgin Islands and the state of West Virginia in which Molina will provide our Medicaid Management Information System to the U.S. Virgin Islands through our West Virginia fiscal agent operation. The contract outlining the sharing of the Molina platform went through several rounds of review at the federal level and has been approved by CMS. The partnership will benefit both the Virgin Islands and taxpayers by avoiding the cost associated with the design, development and implementation of a new system, while gaining leverage from operating on a common platform. This partnership can serve as a model for the country by demonstrating that states and territorial governments can reduce their costs by sharing such technologies for their Medicaid programs. Molina System in the West Virginia is a fully-certified system by the federal government. And as a result, the Virgin Islands will be the first U.S. territory to have a certified system. It is important to note that West Virginia system is the first to be certified under the Department of Health and Human Services' 7 Conditions and Standards for Enhanced Funding. Although the revenue associated with this partnership is small, the precedent established by this partnership is significant. In our health plan business, we are especially proud that our focus on quality continues to attract national attention and recognition from Consumer Reports and the National Committee for Quality Assurance, which ranks the top Medicaid health plans in the country. 8 of our health plans are accredited and have been nationally ranked for the 2012, 2013 cycles. We are especially proud that our New Mexico, Utah and Washington health plans were ranked the top Medicaid Health Plans in their respective states. Our health plans are also gaining recognition for innovative partnerships and programs. For example, Molina Healthcare of California and Sacramento County joined forces to launch the Low-Income Health Program. This program, a safety net managed care health plan administered by Molina, will allow uninsured low-income Sacramento County residents who do not qualify for Medicaid to receive health care. The program is a precursor to the Medicaid expansion in California and the implementation of an insurance exchange pursuant to the Affordable Care Act. It will ensure continuity of care and reduce stress and confusion among members by allowing them to keep their providers when the Affordable Care Act is implemented. Many of our clinics in the Sacramento region will participate as primary care providers. The new plan goes into effect in November of 2012, and up to 14,000 childless adults whose income is less than 67% of the federal poverty level will be enrolled in the Low-Income Health Program. We've also joined forces with America's Health Insurance Plans and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to implement the National Diabetes Prevention Program. As part of this initiative, Molina Healthcare will implement the program to prevent type 2 diabetes in individuals who have prediabetes, a condition of elevated blood sugar that may lead to type 2 diabetes. By developing innovative partnerships with local and regional organizations, Molina Healthcare will be able to leverage existing competencies and resources to provide a National Diabetes Prevention Program to our members in Florida and New Mexico. Molina's involvement in this program also happens to be personally rewarding for me. This positions our company as a national health care leader focused on prevention of a disease that affects nearly 26 million Americans. As an endocrinologist, the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes was the focal point of my medical education, training and research. As we move into the fourth quarter, today's results give us confidence that we're on the right path toward improving our profitability. The combination of our short-term tactical actions, coupled with the experience we are building from the long-term, bodes well for our future. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John, who is celebrating his birthday today with us. Happy birthday, John.
John C. Molina: Thank you, Mario. It's always a pleasure to celebrate your birthday with 58 of your analytical friends. Hello, everyone. As Mario pointed out, today we reported net income of $3 million or $0.07 per diluted share, a substantial improvement over the loss of $0.80 per diluted share that we reported in the second quarter. Of course, our turnaround in Texas is the big story for this quarter. Our medical care ratio dropped from 109% in the second quarter to 90% this quarter. I want to be clear that we still have work to do in Texas. But we are delivering on the commitment we made 3 months ago that Texas would be breakeven on a run rate basis by the end of 2012. It is my belief that we will be able to report success in reaching that goal when we announce our fourth quarter results. With that said, I want to talk for a moment about our third quarter results from my broader perspective. Premium revenue for the third quarter grew to $1.5 billion, representing a 31% increase over the third quarter of 2011. All of the key factors driving our business forward position us well for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Revenue grew due to membership increases, more ABD members and the addition of more benefits into managed care. And the growth in our business is not just year-over-year. We can actually see the changes happening from last quarter to this quarter. We were able to maintain revenue between the second and the third quarters despite the loss of our contract in Missouri. Put another way, our growth in Washington this quarter was enough to offset the loss of all of our membership from Missouri. The growth in Washington came from 2 initiatives, the transition of ABD members into managed care and the transition of additional TANF members to Molina as a result of market consolidation. Our ABD enrollment has grown to 15% of our total membership, representing about 1/3 of our revenue. Our experience managing these chronically-ill and complex members is important because this is a significant area of future growth. Our consolidated medical care ratio decreased sequentially, from 92% in the second quarter to 88% in the third quarter. This decrease was the result of substantial improvement at the Texas health plan, which contributed nearly 1/4 of all premium revenues in the third quarter. And therefore, the medical cost improvements in Texas had a disproportionate impact on our consolidated results. I want to also talk about the traction we're getting in Texas. Now let me provide you with more detail. The medical care ratio for the Texas ABD membership declined to 94% in the third quarter of 2012 from 119% in the second quarter. ABD membership overall constitutes approximately 67% of all Texas health plan revenue. Turning to California, the increase in the medical care ratio year-over-year was primarily due to the mandatory assignment of ABD members previously served under fee-for-service arrangements. Generally speaking, individuals who are new to managed care have higher utilization of medical services upon enrolling into managed care. Our internal data and experience with this population suggest that medical care costs will decrease for the ABD members over time. In California, ABD enrollment was spread out over a 12-month period beginning in June 2011 and ending May of 2012. We have seen utilization decline for the members enrolled early, but are experiencing the expected higher costs from members more recently enrolled. As Mario pointed out during his remarks, we are working with the state by providing input into their review of ABD premium rates in California. We are also exiting a high-cost area with about 6,000 members and a medical care ratio well in excess of 100%. We continue to accrue for the premium impact of the provider cuts called for by Assembly Bill 97 in California. As of September 30, 2012, we have accrued approximately $15 million to pay back to the state as a result of these provider cuts. Because we have not passed on these cuts to providers, this accrual have resulted in a higher medical care ratio at our California health plan since July 1, 2011. General and administrative expenses for the quarter were essentially flat sequentially and year-over-year, at 8.3% of total revenue. Cash flow provided by operating activities grew to $264 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2012, compared with approximately $155 million for the same period last year. This is a 70% higher than it was last year. Similar to last quarter, higher medical claims and benefits payable, mostly in Texas, were the main reasons for the increase in cash flow provided for operating activities, followed by an increase in deferred revenue. We reported a tax benefit in the third quarter. This is the result of a true-up of our year-to-date effective tax rate to reflect the impact of a lower net income, including the effect of nondeductible expenses. The company had cash and investments in excess of $1 billion. Our parent company had cash and investments of $41 million. Days in claims payable increased sequentially by 1 day to 45 days. Year-over-year, days in claims payable increased from 39 days to 45 days. I'm also pleased to report that we had another strong quarter at Molina Medicaid Solutions. We reported operating income for MMS of $8 million for the quarter and $23 million year-to-date. Operating margins for MMS were 17% for the quarter and 18% year-to-date. As we expected when we acquired MMS, the long-run consistency of operating margins in this business counteracts the unevenness that we often observe in the health plans. We have made great strides in improving our operations, which are reflected in the improvement of our third quarter results when compared to second quarter results. But we still have a ways to go until we are satisfied, as the year-over-year results still show a gap. As such, we will not be providing EPS guidance until we are confident that the operational improvements made in Q3 have gained traction for the long term. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. We're ready to take calls.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So Texas question for you. It sounds like the 90.3% MLR would have been -- if you would have the rate increase for the full quarter instead of just 1 month, I'm calculating about 88% and I'm getting a profit for September. So it sounds like your goal of breakeven by year-end, is it fair to say you're kind of already there? Is there something that you're anticipating in the fourth quarter? Is it seasonality of costs or something that could potentially bring you back under that?
John C. Molina: So Josh, this is John. As Terry Bayer likes to say, "One point doesn't constitute a trend, but every trend starts with one point." We had a good September in Texas. I think you calculated it correctly. We do have issues such as seasonality that will creep up in the fourth quarter, so we're not ready to say that Texas has reached our goal, but we're confident that we can get there.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, so not declaring victory I guess. Second question, just around capital needs and stuff. And I guess the first question, just around Missouri and the exit there. The claims runout, is that in line with expectations? And are you expecting any additional capital freeing up over the next, I don't know how long it takes, 6, 9, maybe even 12 months? And then maybe you could just update us on your overall thoughts around capital adequacy and any potential needs for additional capital as you continue to see the top line accelerate?
Joseph W. White: It's Joe. In terms of Missouri, it's playing out essentially as we expected it would. And, yes, sometime between now and first half of next year, we'll be able to withdraw -- I think we've talked about there's somewhere between $20 million and $25 million for Missouri. Regarding overall capital, I think John talked about that in New York quite a bit. I don't know if John wants to add anything.
John C. Molina: Josh, I mean nothing has changed in our thinking right now.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, okay. I would have thought the quarter obviously -- that's positive, but it sounds like the growth is coming in a little bit stronger. So net-net, sort of no change to the overall thoughts around capital?
John C. Molina: Correct.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with JPMorgan.
Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just first in the -- obviously the Texas improvement is fairly dramatic there. I know the rate helps in September, and -- but can you talk us through a little bit about what -- maybe a few of the drivers that you saw in the quarter in terms of what you were able to implement that got that MLR to improve so much. And what you still have left to put in place, maybe in terms of further cost and medical management?
Terry P. Bayer: This is Terry. We always share with you that we use a very basic and simple formula to improve our medical costs. We had unit cost changes, we had utilization changes, we had claims processing changes, and then we had a rate increase. And all of that combined came into play to bring down that MCR. I think the details are simply that we looked at our highest cost providers and we brought them back closer to the Medicaid fee schedule or made the adjustments we needed to there. We greatly enhanced our active utilization management and increased our activities so that only appropriate care was being authorized, and we did implement a number of claims processing changes that relate to implementation of state fee schedules. So you're quite correct that the rate increase helped. At this point, we continue on as we do in all of our markets, we'll continue to monitor our unit costs, we'll continue to manage the utilization and implement other changes as they come. So there's nothing dramatic to share with you except a continuation of the same.
Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Can you delineate for us what the unit cost versus utilization, just to give us some idea of where the bigger --
Terry P. Bayer: We haven't looked at it in that greater detail.
Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. Just a follow-up then on the California dual rollout and kind of what you're seeing now at ABD. So first, can you remind us what the -- when the ABD rates were set here, and as you're kind of relooking at them now, what was the assumed savings versus fee-for-service in these rates?
Terry P. Bayer: We've heard -- this is Terry again. We've heard that the state was looking upwards of 20% to 30% for savings, but that was not shared early on with us as overtly as it was for instance in the Texas market. So there was a cost savings embedded there, and all of the health plans have -- brought together their combined experience and are working with the state actuaries at the state's recognition that they're going to reevaluate the rates now that we are post-16 months into that population rollout.
Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay and just -- and then thinking about the California dual rollout, any update there on timing? And what kind of savings that California might be looking at with the duals? Would it be similar? Would it be materially different there?
Joseph Mario Molina: The state had not updated us beyond what we shared with you folks in September.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Just to come back to California real quickly. On the 6,000 members in the unprofitable service area, what will that do to the MLR perspectively? Or I guess, at a minimum, can you give us a sense for how much of a drag they were on the current quarter?
John C. Molina: Chris, this is John. We didn't separately quantify what the profitability was for those members. It's a relatively small number out of the 350,000 that we've got. Suffice to say that, for that group though, on the MLR side, the medical care costs were exceeding 100% of premium.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: How many of the 6,000 were ABD? Or any of them ABD?
John C. Molina: I couldn't tell you. I would imagine that some of them probably were, but I couldn't tell you how many of them were.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And then more broadly in California, on the rate side, I believe a portion of your membership was supposed to receive a rate update October 1. Did that happen? Or have you been given any color as to what that rate change might look like?
John C. Molina: The 2-plan model contracts, L.A., Riverside, San Bernardino, have an October 1 rate year. I think the state has given out draft rates that folks are looking at and looking at the methodology and commenting on. They're not final yet. And so we don't typically comment on draft rates.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I mean anything directionally? Or are you expecting a positive rate update?
John C. Molina: Right now, I think that they are still in negotiations. If it was dramatic, I think we would have said something. Other plans would have said something. But the fact that no one is doing much in the way commenting would suggest that it's probably what we expected. If you recall at the January Investor Day, we're talking about rates flat to slightly down.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And then changing gears. I know you don't have a lot of members in Wisconsin, and it's not a big part of your business right now, but obviously United has left there. And you saw a pretty big sequential drop in MLR. Is this now a business that you would be actively soliciting? Or any color on what's going on there would be great.
Joseph Mario Molina: This is Mario. No, we're not actively soliciting any of that business. The state will reassign those members beginning, I believe, in February, we are still working with the state trying to determine what the rates will be for next year. We don't yet have the rates. And that's going to have a big impact on our decision whether or not to stay in Wisconsin. Obviously, we would pick up a portion of those members. And unless we get an appropriate rate increase, we probably will not be able to remain in Wisconsin.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Seems like you've done well with Washington considering bringing on the ABD population, is this a situation of familiarity with the state and population that kind of helped you manage it out of the gate? And I guess your comfort level, just in terms of the unlikeliness of seeing any hiccups there, relative to maybe some of the other states where you have seen issues within this population?
Joseph Mario Molina: Yes, this is Mario again. I want to go back to the comments I made earlier, and that is that having an established provider network and experience in the market is really helpful when you're transitioning new populations. We have a very strong provider network in Washington. It's a plant with a lot of experience. We've been operating there since 2000. Good reputation, good relationships, and that has made a big difference. I think that any time we're in a situation where we can transition members to an existing service area, like the upcoming situation in Ohio, that's certainly our preference.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just going back to California sort of higher MLR there, and state to review the premiums. Does that -- I guess does that give you any pause around the duals? Or how you think about the ability to manage that population at all? And then how do we think about startup costs and initial MLRs for the California duals?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, first of all -- this is Mario again. I think everyone has struggled in California with the implementation of the ABD patients, and that's why there's been a lot of discussion back and forth with the state over the rates. The other thing to remember, as John pointed out, that, that these patients were rolled in 1 month at a time over a 12-month period. And while the costs have been lower for those that entered early, as they've come down, we still have -- of patients that came in later and we're still experiencing higher medical costs. If you look at all the states though, one of the things we've pointed out is that the ABD patients have pushed up the medical costs somewhat. And that's to be expected, when you got relatively sick patients who are higher utilizers than the TANF patients, and these are patients that are new to managed care. I think the same applies for the duals. And when we get the ABD members in who are duals, we're going to have similar issues and it's going to take time to work down the medical costs. So we have said before, we expect higher medical costs for certain populations in the future. We think we can bring them down over time. And we also think that a big key to managing the duals is going to be managing the long-term care benefits, which are less medical and more social and supportive in nature.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Carol with Stifel.
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Sticking with Washington state, enrollment was much higher there than we expected. I guess 2-part question. Did you retain more than you expected? Or did members voluntarily stay with Molina, given your presence in the state? And secondly, is there anything to suggest that this enrollment will become more costly as claims mature a bit more over the next couple months?
John C. Molina: Tom, this is John. With respect to your first question, we did get a greater retention and we did get greater new enrollment, which is why enrollment is higher than what we had guided to back in January. Not quite sure what you mean by the second part of your question. Will this enrollment be more expensive? Could you clarify?
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: So you have new enrollment coming in, and we're seeing a slight increase in the MLR in the market, and I'm just wondering if there's any other data points you can give us to provide some comfort that we won't see another 3 or 4 or 5 or whatever percent increase -- percentage point increase in the MLR in that market, with a bolus of new members coming in.
John C. Molina: I apologize, Tom. I heard disenrollment, not this enrollment. Perhaps I need a hearing aid for my birthday. Right now the data that we've got -- the claims data from the first 3 months suggest that the costs are not running up higher than we expected. I think we actually got a little bit of positive development for Washington, so we're feeling that the costs are in line.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Getting back to the Texas question again, your ABD MLR is from 119% down to 94%. I think you said maybe 1/3 of that comes from the rate in September, but the other 2/3 comes from other things. Are there some onetime items in there that we can sort of back out or timing things that we can back out? Or should we look at that as the current run rate trend? I know you don't talk a lot about prior period development, but if you can discuss that, perhaps that would help us understand it? Or maybe is there a timing differential between when you got the rate increase versus when you have to pass some of that rate increase along to providers?
Joseph Mario Molina: Now I think part of what's changing that is you have to factor in the premium deficiency reserve that we took in the second quarter. So I think you're going to see this from some other folks in the future, as these new contracts come online, if other organizations take a premium with the efficiency reserve in one period, then they push costs from a future period into the current period. We did that in second quarter, so we didn't have those costs occurring in the third quarter.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: So there's none to be backed out that you didn't over reserve perhaps at that point?
John C. Molina: The premium deficiency reserve, it has an impact. I think that we are very adequately reserved from a pure claims standpoint in Texas. If you look at the days in claims payable, if you look at our cash flow, which you see is an increase in the medical claims benefit line, a lot of that is coming from increasing the reserves in Texas. So I don't think it's a case that we're going to be under-reserved in Texas. I also don't think that the 90-plus% MCR that we experienced is the run rate. I think that what Terry talked about in terms of decreasing utilization and having some of the provider contract changes take -- have full effect. We should see continued improvement there medical care ratio for the ABD members.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And then can you talk about the timing on the California rate review process? Like what's the time frame on that?
John C. Molina: We've submitted our data. I don't know who else has yet. Obviously, we're pushing the state to get us an answer as quick as possible. But we also want to make sure that we don't exchange expediency for accuracy. We want the right rate, not a quick one.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And if you had a handicap, what's the likelihood that, that rate goes higher versus goes lower?
John C. Molina: If I had a handicap stuff, I'd be at the racetrack, I think. I mean it's really hard to know. Our data suggest that they were too aggressive in the rate assumptions.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Melissa McGinnis with Morgan Stanley.
Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: One more thing on Texas, just to understand as well some of the things that might be driving the margin improvement there. Was there any disproportionate loss of membership of some of the higher-cost members? Because it actually looks like despite the rate increase, your premiums PMPM came down sequentially. I'm just trying to understand what might be the driver of that.
Terry P. Bayer: Sure, this is Terry. We shared with you at Investor Day about an 8% drop in our ABD enrollment, about close to 10,000 members over the last 3 or 4 months. And yes, those that dropped out were running a significantly higher MCR.
Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, great. And then --
Terry P. Bayer: Let me just add this. This is Terry again. That also impacted the mix on the rate increase we received. So we received slightly over 4% rate increase and it would have been greater if we would have had more higher cost members. So that was calculated very thoughtfully by the state to pick up the gap where the higher costs were.
Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Right, great. And then maybe switching to a different market. If we look at Michigan, the MOR there has come up pretty significantly over the last 9 months. And I was just wondering, if I'm remembering right, Michigan actually carved in or started assigning some of their duals on the Medicaid side. Is that having any impact on the MLR there? And I guess, just wanting to understand the margin change in that market.
Joseph Mario Molina: Melissa, this is John. The margin change primarily due to the change in the premium tax, it used to be, I believe 6%. And so it had the effect of bumping up the revenue, and then we would take the premium tax line out of admin, not out of the medical cost. So that's had the biggest change in what appears to be MCR margin.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies.
David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: So I wanted to follow up on Peter Costa's question, ask one more directly on -- as I look at your claims and benefits payable schedule for the 3 months ended September of 2012, the prior period positive development is $47 million and is from a negative development number on the last quarter. And I guess I wanted to understand more directly how much of that, if any, affected the income statement in the current quarter.
Joseph W. White: This is Joe speaking. Without going into a state-by-state basis. I think it's fair to say that much of the -- we talked in the second quarter about the negative impact of prior period development in Texas. We think we've restored those reserves in the second quarter and then carried on into the third. So if you look at the $46 million of prior period development from Q2 to Q3, that's pretty consistent with what we've shown in the past, if you look out the runout from 2010 -- 2009. So again, I would say, I think we caught up in the second quarter and we've maintained those margins in the third.
David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. So as I think about the change, then in MLR is the sequential change in MLR not attributable to some of this positive development?
Joseph W. White: I think we talked in -- I think we talked at length that you go back to our second quarter release, we talked about the impact of the PVR and unfavorable development in the second quarter, I think it was $10 million on the PVR and $12 million in unfavorable development. I think the better approach is to go back and relook at your calculation at the second quarter MCR rather than the third.
David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay, all right, I'll do that. So then, here's another follow-up on Washington. In light of this -- you've kind of answer this question already, but I'll ask it again. So in light of a couple other states where you're highlighting MLRs above 93% on ABD populations, can you talk about maybe how much visibility you have? How much claims inventory you have in hand today to give you the confidence on the 93%? Or how you would expect to track and that and play that out over the next several months or perhaps by comparison, how did the MLRs progress in those other states to get to this level? Some over 100%, like California and Texas?
John C. Molina: This is John. I think in Texas, we got the membership all at once. So just to sort that out was difficult. In California -- and little bit different because the enrollment progressed over a period of 12 months. I think in California, what the bigger driver is in terms of the MCR for that particular population is the rate giveback that we have accrued. So if you think that we want to give back a significant premium to the state, we've got to record it at $15 million, but we didn't drop the provider rates because the state didn't. You've got a mismatch there, which you don't see necessarily in other states. It's hard to take the experience in 1 state and necessarily translate it to the other. What we've got in Washington is stable provider base, rates that we believe having looked at it, are adequate for the population and frankly, some pretty aggressive UM up in Washington that has provided us with the confidence as we watched the claims run out now for 90 days at least that we're not going to have a significant negative development in the future.
Joseph Mario Molina: This is Mario. Let me just comment on California, to be sure you understand. In California, there was supposed to have been a provider fee schedule cut. There were some issues in the court that prevented that, but the issue is not resolved. And so we have been reserving, as if we were going to have to give money back to the state, because of this provider fee schedule change. Because our contracts, many of our contracts in California are tied to that Medicaid fee schedule. Until the state changes it, we don't change it either. So we've understood there's mismatch.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Carl McDonald from Citigroup.
Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just wanted to follow up on that $15 million accrual in California. And my understanding from some others was that it didn't sound like that rate cut was actually going to be implemented, so I'd be interested in your latest conversations with the state, if you have a bias one way or the other.
John C. Molina: We certainly do have a bias, Carl. And that is, until we see the final rate sheets, we're just going to keep doing what we've been doing. So we know that other plans have had discussions with the state about reversing that. And if that's the decision the state makes, then we will reverse it. Otherwise, we are confident that we're well protected against the state coming back and asking us for money.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Scott Green from Merrill Lynch.
Scott J. Green - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Can you tell us, did you make an accrual in the current period for lower California provider rate? Or is that kind of annualized now?
John C. Molina: The accrual is running about $1 million a month.
Scott J. Green - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. All right. And then one more on the California ABD MLR. You said it was higher, mostly attributable to the recently-added lives. But it looks like in the press release, you only added 3,000 sequentially. So I was hoping you could elaborate, whether just those most recently added that are driving that or was there some unfavorable developments in the current period California MLR?
Joseph Mario Molina: Scott, this is Mario. If you go back to our investor day, there was a slide where we showed a cohort of patients that we followed forward for 10 months, and you saw how their cost went down. Well, the more recent patients are still running at higher costs so it's going to take a while to work through that. And that's what we're talking about here. So that, that group that came on in the first month, we think has -- their costs have flattened out. But it's going to take 10 to 12 months for each cohort to kind of flatten out again. And that's what we mean. So there are continued upward pressure and it's going to level off and then go down.
Scott J. Green - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. I thought you had said before that ABD MLR in California was around 95% and now we are seeing a step-up to 110% and I wasn't sure what was driving that because it didn't seem like you added so many new members. But you're saying it's kind of been and remains elevated?
Joseph Mario Molina: It's sort of a blended number, and it's going to take time for that to come down, but we think that it will come down over time next year.
Joseph W. White: Scott, it's Joe. There are a couple of items though that were, I think are driving that number higher than we would the California MCR than we would expect in a run rate. First thing I'd like to point out, it's the California has removed its premium tax this quarter. So this would apply not just to the ABD to SBDs, but across the California population. That's probably driving MCR of about 1.5%. This is analogous to the situation in Michigan in the start of the second quarter. We've also had some catch-up in California on capitation payments, specific to the STDs. We've had to go out and recontract with some of our cap providers to allow for the higher premium. So you do have some factors in there that are spiking at this quarter, but I wouldn't call run rate issues.
Scott J. Green - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, that's really helpful. Would you say the run rate maybe is a couple hundred basis points less or any way to estimate that?
Joseph W. White: When I take an estimate of the premium tax, 1.5%; the cap issue in unfavorable prior period development, probably another 2.5%. This is all on the California consolidated MCR. So we definitely saw a little bit of an uptick this quarter, but not nearly as much as the financials suggest.
Scott J. Green - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then can you talk about the MMIS revenue trajectory? What drove the sequential increase and how you see that trending going forward?
Joseph W. White: The sequential increase in MMS revenue is really just accounting. If you recall, we've been deferring revenue and expense recognition for the Idaho MMIS. We went through some accounting exercises with that last year you'll recall, where we had some write-offs. So upon receipt of CMS certification and acceptance of the system by the state of Idaho in July, we started recognizing both revenue and expense in MMIS. The P&L impact is pretty much 0 because, as you'll recall, we were booking revenue and expense at very similar amounts. But it will drive higher revenue and higher expense.
Scott J. Green - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then one last one, real quick. Any update on California's -- it was thinking about integrating the CHIP and Medi-Cal programs? I was just curious whatever happened with that?
John C. Molina: It is definitely happening and it will begin I believe in January. You will see those former CHIP members will roll over to Medicaid.
Scott J. Green - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And do you view that as a positive or a neutral or a risk for your business?
Joseph Mario Molina: I think it's largely neutral.
Operator: And we have time for one more question. It comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: I wanted to speak about contract opportunities and I guess I would break it up into 3 buckets here: Ohio, Michigan and MMIS. On Ohio, that was just -- Ohio duals was just pushed back. And I was wondering if you had any thoughts on the reasoning and if there had been any resolution there on some of the unknowns like Day 1 savings or rates?
Terry P. Bayer: This is Terry. So you know what we know, we are just at the mercy of the state letting us know when their startup dates. We know they're in negotiation with CMS. This is really a new venture for these states to work out with CMS, how these 3-part contracts are going to go. And I think they're learning as they go, and as glitches in their rollout process occur, they just turn to us and let us know it's delayed. But we have had no further official delay, although we've heard as well.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: And then on Michigan, as we're getting close to the end of the year here, are you still expecting to hear an update on awards in 2012?
Terry P. Bayer: No. We haven't even embarked on that RFP process. Michigan did note originally was attempting to go forth with an RFP this year for 2013. They then let us know mid-process that it would be a 1/1/2014, but the RFP process for the duals has not yet been rolled out. And we've heard nothing further about a further delay. So as far as we're concerned, they're still targeting 1/1/2014 for their duals launch.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Do have a date when you expect the RFP to be rolled out?
Terry P. Bayer: No. Sorry, we don't. We don't have any further information.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: And then the last bucket would be for MMIS if you could just talk about some of the opportunities that you're evaluating, the CMS MMIS fiscal agent contract status report suggested about 4 to 5 contracts were coming up for rebid a year. So just any thoughts on how active we may be pursuing this new contracts and as some of them coming up for rebid in 2012 and 2013 are in states where you have a managed care contracts, if you could just speak to which contracts may be of more interest to you?
John C. Molina: Sarah, this is John. When we bought the business, we wanted it to target the states where we didn't have a managed care presence. We have plenty of growth opportunities in the health plan business, so there's no reason to cannibalize ourselves and there are enough states for the MMS business to pursue RFPs, I think that frankly, the Virgin Island example might give us real innovative and competitive target or competitive advantages in some of these applications. But right now, we're not disclosing where we're playing.
Operator: And Dr. Molina, I will now turn the call back to you to continue with your presentation or closing remarks.
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, thanks, everyone. I have nothing else to add. We look forward to being with you again at the next quarterly earnings call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a great evening, everyone.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Molina Healthcare Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, July 26, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Juan José Orellana, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Juan Jose Orellana: Thank you, Kim. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare's financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2012. The company's earnings release reporting its results was issued today after the market closed and is now posted for viewing on our company website. Participating for Molina today will be Dr. Mario Molina, our CEO; John Molina, our CFO; Terry Bayer, our COO; and Joseph White, our Chief Accounting Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our comments today contained forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, including, but not limited to, statements regarding the Ohio Medicaid and Duals RFA contract awards and pending appeals; Medicaid enrollment growth projections; and the implementation of dual eligibles integration and demonstration projects; our medical cost-containment initiatives in Texas and the finalization of a rate increase in Texas, effective September 1, 2012; Wisconsin rates and premium deficiency reserves with respect to estimated losses in Texas and Wisconsin. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K annual report for fiscal year 2011, our Form 10-Q quarterly reports and our Form 8-K current reports.

This call is being recorded, and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available over the Internet through the company's website at molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina.
Joseph Mario Molina: Thank you, Juan José. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Considering the positive trends experienced in a number of previous quarters, Molina's results for the second quarter were a disappointment to us. Despite increasing revenue by 32% and enrollment by 13%, the continuation of higher-than-expected medical cost at our Texas health plan significantly contributed to the net loss of $0.80 per share that we reported today. The factors affecting medical cost in Texas included higher-than-anticipated utilization of long-term care services, unfavorable unit costs and inadequate premiums to cover the medical costs associated with STAR+ members in the Hidalgo and El Paso service areas. John will be describing shortly some of our efforts to get us back on track in Texas in the second half of 2012. I want to emphasize that the second quarter also included key developments that will notably contribute to driving long-term value for our shareholders. Let me take a moment to review the most significant developments. First, our protest filing in the Ohio Medicaid RFA was upheld by the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, also known as ODJFS. This outcome results in the retention of our existing business in Ohio, which constitutes approximately 20% of the company's premium revenue. It also enables us to expand to 38 new counties, previously not served by our health plan. The market opportunity in these 38 counties is comprised of approximately 750,000 CFC or TANF beneficiaries and 64,000 ABD beneficiaries. Although the contract is currently delayed, as the new awards are being litigated by other applicants, the rescoring of the RFP resulted in a score for Molina that ranked third out of the 5 selected health plans, firmly positioning our application among the top scorers. Another key development during the second quarter was the Supreme Court's ruling on the Affordable Care Act. The court upheld the Medicaid expansion, but included a new twist. The federal government may not threaten the states that don't participate in the expansion with the loss of their existing Medicaid funding. The ruling, which effectively makes expansion optional, transforms Medicaid expansion from a legal issue into primarily a political one. Although we don't know which states will ultimately opt out, our working assumption is that some state governments will choose to participate. A report released by the Congressional Budget Office earlier this week supports this assumption. The CBO's updated estimates, which incorporate the Supreme Court decision, now size the Medicaid enrollment opportunity at 11 million new beneficiaries by the year 2022, down 6 million from previous estimates. Although these expansion figures are lower than what was initially expected, it still represents considerable potential growth for companies like Molina. Our strategy remains the same. We continue to forge ahead in our reform readiness for January 2014. We are scaling the company for growth opportunities, both before and after that January 2014 date. And we also remain focused on the pursuit of near-term opportunities, such as the dual eligibles integration pilot programs. On June 28, ODJFS announced the preliminary scoring results for all 7 regions of its dual eligible RFA. The RFA covers over 114,000 beneficiaries, and the contracts are scheduled to begin on April 2013. We are pleased that Molina Healthcare of Ohio received the highest scores in the 3 regions where nearly 53,000 or 43% of Ohio's dual eligibles reside. As a reminder, these regions reflect our current Covered Families And Children or CANF and ABD footprint. According to ODJFS, once the scoring protest period is complete, the top 2 scorers in each region are expected to be awarded a contract, with a maximum of 3 regions awarded per health plan. The final tentative health plan selections are expected after August 7. You may recall that last April, Molina Healthcare was selected by the California Department of Health Care Services to participate as an integrated health plan in a proposed dual eligible demonstration project in San Diego County, and as a subcontractor in Los Angeles County. These 2 counties have approximately 449,000 dual eligibles. During the month of June, the California legislature approved Governor Brown's expansion of the dual eligible demonstration project from 4 counties to 8. The 4 additional counties are Alameda, Riverside, San Bernardino and Santa Clara. Our California health plan currently participates in the Medicaid program in 2 of these counties, Riverside and San Bernardino, where 101,000 dual eligibles reside. We presently operate our Medicare Advantage Special Needs plans in Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties. A key feature of the California dual eligible proposal is that initial participation in the program is restricted to health plans that currently participate in the state's Medicaid program. The state's proposal still needs federal approval from CMS and is expected to be implemented in April 2013 with a phased-in enrollment process. As we've discussed before, the dual eligible patients present complex problems. But we are gaining experience, and we're confident that we will be well positioned to serve these patients as we move forward. Our experience with provider benefits range from acute to long-term care for Medicare and Medicaid will be critical to serving the dual eligible patients. As we have learned from our recent experience in Texas, it is critically important that a managed care organization understand the environment and health care drivers affecting the coordination of Medicaid long-term care benefits with the traditional Medicare benefits that we will be responsible for in the future. We continue to hone our dual eligible care coordination expertise by capturing the knowledge we have gained through our implementation of both small demonstration programs, as well as large implementations. For example, in Florida, we have begun providing home and community-based services in lieu of nursing home placement for Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries in 2 counties. In Washington, we continue to participate in the Washington Medicaid Integration Partnership for the ABDs, which integrates medical, mental health, chemical dependency treatment services and long-term care services in Snohomish County. On a larger scale, our growing understanding of long-term care with the Texas STAR+ program and the data we are capturing will enable us to emerge from the current situation with a deeper understanding of the challenges inherit in caring for the dual eligible member. In Texas, about 70% of our current STAR+ members are dual eligibles. Washington and California are 2 other large states where we are learning from the transition of thousands of ABD patients from fee-for-service to managed care. We believe our participation in both small and large programs will provide us with a tested strategy for addressing the challenges for the upcoming dual eligible implementations. However, the experience in assisting these complex patients, seamlessly integrated coordination of care and medical management are only part of the solution. Actuarially sound rate setting and expectations on program savings compared to fee-for-service will also play a very important role in the success of dual eligible integration programs. As we've now seen in the state of Texas, when states develop premium rates for health plans with cost saving assumptions that proved to be too aggressive, it can have a destabilizing effect on members, providers and health plans. CMS estimates that in some states, the savings target should be up to 5% by the end of the third year. In California, the Department of Health Care Services estimated savings from 3% to 6% by year 3 with full implementation. We still need to work more diligently with states to set actuarially sound and adequate rates. Finally, let me turn to a couple of other key developments. We're very pleased that our Medicaid Management Information System or MMIS contract in New Jersey was renewed for another 4 years and then in Idaho, we received full federal certification for our MMIS from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. As a result of the certification, the state can now claim 75% federal reimbursement for ongoing operations retroactive to June 1, 2010. The system serves over 230,000 beneficiaries and handles over 140,000 claims per week. Idaho joins Maine as the second state where our system is federally certified since Molina acquired the fiscal agent business in 2010. Our systems are now certified in all 5 states where we currently operate as fiscal agents: Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, New Jersey and West Virginia. I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the staff of our fiscal agent subsidiary, Molina Medicaid Solutions, on a job well done. We're also very pleased to share with you that despite all the challenges in Texas, our focus on quality in that state has not been compromised. We received the final results of our 2012 NCQA accreditation survey last week. And the accreditation of our Texas health plan has been extended for 3 more years. Congratulations to our Texas team on a great achievement. The second quarter of 2012 has illustrated both the opportunities and the challenges facing Molina Healthcare today. I want to reassure you that we are not standing still and that we have redoubled our efforts to get us back on track in the second half of 2012 and beyond. While we're disappointed that our financial results fell short of our earlier expectations, none of these setbacks have changed our view regarding the favorable, long-term prospects for our company. I'd now like to turn the call over to John.
John C. Molina: Thank you, Mario. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported a loss in the second quarter of $37 million or $0.80 per diluted share compared with net income of $17 million or $0.38 per diluted share for the same quarter last year. Although these results were not what we'd hoped for, I want to emphasize that we believe problems we have seen this quarter are isolated and resolvable. If we look beyond Texas, Missouri and Wisconsin, we can see the rest of the company is performing about the way we'd expected it to perform. Missouri has been a disappointment this quarter. But the termination of our contract effective June 30 has brought an end to this problem. Wisconsin was another trouble spot. However, enrollment there is small enough such that its impact on the company is limited while we work with the state to develop more sustainable rates. I'll talk in more detail about Texas in a minute. But for now, let me say that starting September 1, we expect to have a rate increase in Texas that will take us about half the way to breakeven. We're in the process of implementing cost-containment initiatives that should bring us the rest of the way to breakeven on a run-rate basis by the end of the year. Turning to overall performance for a minute. Premium revenues for the second quarter grew to $1.5 billion representing a 32% increase over the second quarter of 2011. Revenue grew due to membership increases; a shift in member mix of the populations like the ABD, which generate higher premium revenues; and due to increased revenue linked to benefit expansions, such as the pharmacy benefit carbon in Ohio and the in-patient and pharmacy benefits in Texas that were added effective March 1, 2012. Aggregate membership grew to $1.85 million or 13% year-over-year, with the bulk of the sequential enrollment gains coming from Texas. However, as things settle down in Texas, we do expect to lose some enrollment there. Our Ohio and Washington plans also contributed large enrollment gains when compared to last year. I want to remind everyone that as of July 1, we will not be reporting any enrollment in Missouri since our contract with the state expired on June 30. We expect that the decline in membership from Missouri will be partially offset by enrollment gains in Washington, which is coming in above expectations. As of July, the Washington plan had grown by an additional 41,000 new members from the number which we are reporting today, including 12,000 new ABD members which are also higher than we anticipated. This increase in our ABD enrollment in Washington highlights the shift in patient mix that we are experiencing. Overall, our ABD enrollment reached nearly 253,000. ABD enrollment grew by nearly 93,000 members or 58% year-over-year led by Texas and California, which grew by 59,000 and 24,000, respectively. In addition, our Medicare plans, which are comprised primarily of dual eligible members, grew by 6,500 members or approximately 25% year-over-year, giving us more experience in serving complex populations. We now have 109,000 dual eligible beneficiaries enrolled through various contracts even though we're not getting the combined revenue for these members. To give you a sense on how significant the ABDs are becoming to our business, in Texas, our ABD membership represents approximately 37% of our total enrollment there, but it generates approximately 70% of our revenues in that state. Because of revenues of the Texas health plan constitute nearly 25% of the company's consolidated premium revenue for the second quarter of 2012, the high medical care ratio in that state had a disproportionate impact on our results. Our consolidated medical care ratio increased to 92.3% during the second quarter compared with 84.1% in the same period last year. Again, if we look beyond Texas, Missouri and Wisconsin, we can see the rest of the company is performing about the way we had expected it to perform. Excluding Texas, Missouri and Wisconsin, our medical care ratio in the quarter would have been 85.3%. The sharp increase in Missouri's medical care ratio was a result of higher in-patient utilization and high dollar claims from premature infants. However, since the Missouri contract concluded at the end of June, we do not anticipate this will be an issue in the second half of 2012. In Wisconsin, our health plan reported a medical care ratio for the second quarter of 121% compared with 81% in the same quarter last year. We believe the premium rates in Wisconsin are not adequate to cover our costs and as a result, we recorded a premium deficiency reserve for the Wisconsin health plan at June 30 of $3 million. Our Wisconsin health plan is expected to receive new premium rates effective January 1, 2013. We will work with the state to make sure that those rates are actuarially sound and sustainable. In the meantime, we are renegotiating hospital contracts and undertaking efforts to improve profitability in Wisconsin. Now, let's spend some time on Texas. The medical care ratio of the Texas plan for the second quarter was 109.4% compared with 95% for the same quarter last year. We have recorded a premium deficiency reserve for the Texas plan at June 30 of $10 million. Additionally, second quarter results were adversely impacted by $14 million of unfavorable prior period development of claims reserves from our estimate at March 31, 2012. In estimated expenses in setting claims reserves for the first quarter, we had to rely heavily upon historical data provided by the state's Medicaid agency in place of our own claims payment experience, which was almost nonexistent, for the new regions and benefits. We now have the benefit of 4 months of claims experience since the regional and benefit expansion was launched on May 1 of this year -- March 1, excuse me. Our own experience had demonstrated that our reserve estimates at the close of the first quarter were too low, but that same experience gives as much greater confidence in the adequacy of our reserves at June 30. Absent this unfavorable prior period development and the $10 million premium deficiency reserve, the medical care ratio for the Texas plan would have been 102.7% for the second quarter. We believe the premium rates associated with the ABD contracts, specifically in El Paso and Hidalgo service areas, are not adequate to cover the medical costs associated with serving those members. The utilization of long-term care services, including personal attendants to help with activities of daily living, is currently far exceeding the utilization elsewhere in the state and is also far exceeding the assumptions used by the state of Texas to determine the premium rates. Furthermore, our ABD market share in these 2 regions amplifies the impact on results. As of June 30, 2012, Molina served more than 13,000 STAR+ members in the El Paso service area, accounting for 56% of the market where there are 2 plans. And Molina served approximately 32,000 STAR+ members in the Hidalgo service area, accounting for 43% of the market where there are 3 plans. Based on preliminary information from the state, we expect to lose some STAR+ membership in August. We estimate our monthly loss in Texas before taxes to be approximately $14 million. The state of Texas has released preliminary rates, which we estimate will add an additional $7.4 million in premium revenue each month effective September 1. In addition, we believe the various initiatives aimed at reducing utilization and unit costs will improve profitability by approximately $6.6 million each month by the end of the year. These initiatives include changes in provider contracts, changes in the way we pay our hospitals and the implementation of prior authorizations. We are required to establish premium deficiency reserves for any of our contracts whenever we believe the estimated future costs of serving that contract exceed the estimated revenues to be derived from that contract. In other words, when our operational improvements alone are not enough to reach profitability, we must record a premium deficiency reserve. As a practical matter, we test for premium deficiency at the state level for all of our Medicaid and CHIP contracts combined. The period we test the efficiency is the time from the measurement date, in this case June 30, 2012, through the end of the rate year. For our Wisconsin HMO, since rates will not be adjusted until January 1, 2013, we have estimated the excess costs over premiums for the period July 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012. Specifically, we estimate the cost will exceed revenue by $3 million over that 6-month period. For our Texas HMO where rates will be adjusted effective September 1, 2012, we have estimated the excess costs over premiums for that -- for the period of July 1, 2012 through August 21 -- August 31, 2012 to be $10 million. By establishing premium deficiency reserves, we have brought in to the second quarter of 2012 losses that, otherwise, would have been reported in the third and fourth quarters of 2012. Regardless, our recording of a premium deficiency reserve does not represent a change in our perspective regarding the long-term performance of either Texas or Wisconsin health plans. General and administrative expenses for the quarter increased to 8.6% of total revenue compared with 8.3% of total revenue for the same quarter last year. Principal factors behind the increase in the percentage of our revenue spent on general and administrative costs were a $1.1 million charge related to a decline in the value of the interest rate swap on our corporate office building, higher business development costs for both our health plan and MMS segments, higher legal costs incurred in the course of our appeal of the Missouri contract award, and higher advertising costs. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $236 million for the 6 months ended June 30, 2012 compared with nearly $115 million for the same period last year. Higher medical claims and benefits payable, mainly in Texas, were the main reasons for the increased cash flow provided by operating activities followed by an increase in deferred revenue. Medical claims and benefits payable were a source of $123 million in 2012 compared with the use of $13 million in 2011. Deferred revenue was a source of operating cash amounting to $125 million in 2012 compared with $38 million in 2011. This is primarily due to timing issues in the receipt of payments for Michigan and Washington.  In addition, $50 million was drawn on our credit facility to meet the increased net worth requirements associated with the growth of our Texas health plan. For the first time, the company had cash and investments in excess of $1 billion. The parent company had cash and investments of $40 million. Days and claims payable remained flat sequentially at 44 days. Year-over-year, days and claims payable increased from 39 days to 44 days. Performance at our MMS subsidiary improved for the 3 months and 6 months ended June 30, 2012, due to the stabilization of our Idaho and Maine operations. We're also very pleased with the federal certification of our Idaho claims processing system. The federal certification is an important strategic milestone for Molina Medicaid Solutions as it should more favorably position our subsidiary to an additional MMIS procurements in new and existing states. As we have discussed in the past, certification triggers revenue and expense recognition. However, the additional revenue will be offset by an equivalent increase in costs. The current contract in Idaho runs through November 2014. Because of the uncertainties related to the timing of Texas improvements, the company is not updating its earnings guidance, which was withdrawn on June 30, 2012. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So let's start with a bunch of different things. Let's start with capital needs. Do you think there's any short-term or even intermediate-term needs for capital? And I guess, maybe for Mario and John, is there -- is this a time where you start thinking about larger, diversified, well-capitalized companies as partners?
John C. Molina: Josh, let me answer the first part of your question regarding capital needs. There is no need for us to go out and raise capital. However, I think, as we saw, frankly, when we had the $1 million hit because of the interest rate swap that we put on this building, interest rates continued to be all-time lows. So while there may not be a need, we're certainly looking at it as the time to get the cash because as the company grows, inevitably, there will be some need either for additional acquisitions or to fund especially the growth coming from the Duals.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So you're just talking specifically around debt. If there's need for capital, you're only thinking about debt at this point?
John C. Molina: That's right.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with JPMorgan.
Kenneth Lavine - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: It's Ken. Looks like Josh got cut off there, but maybe just in a meantime, just talk a little bit about the lives that are switching out of Texas in the ABD lives that are going to another plan. Can you maybe just talk about what the drivers are there for the particular members switching out and what the MLR is on those lives relative to the rest of the STAR+ lives in Texas?
Joseph Mario Molina: We don't know what the reason is, and we don't know what the MLR is. We just got a preliminary report from the state. And frankly, given the dynamics, there's 3 very good plans in Hidalgo. It makes sense that over time, enrollment would even out.
Kenneth Lavine - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And then as you kind of look at your run rate earnings now in Texas, looks about the $14 million multi-thing, is that based off -- is that kind of where were we stand right now? Or is that the average in the second quarter? Just because given the continuity of care provisions kind of ended at the start of June, just kind of wondering where -- what the $14 million starting point is there?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, first off, let me clarify the continuity of care provisions. There is a mixture of continuity of care provisions. The continuity of care provisions for acute services is 90 days. But the majority of our problem is not with acute care services, it's with the long-term care services. The continuity of care provisions for long-term care services is 6 months. So we have to honor the state's prior authorized services for 6 months or until we can get in and reassess the patients ourselves. And we are undertaking that, but it is a difficult task because it takes a nurse going into the home and filling out a complex form. We can probably get 1 or 2 of those done per nurse, per day. So that's not a quick turnaround. And while we are prior authorizing things like in-patient stays, that's not where the real cost problem lies.
John C. Molina: So Ken, getting back to your question about the $14 million loss was pretty much the same each of the 3 months of the quarter.
Kenneth Lavine - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And how does that connect to the $10 million premium deficiency, I guess, for July and August? It would just seem that they're just doubling the other $14 million. And just kind of -- if you can kind of connect that to the $10 million premium deficiency, and that's all we have there.
John C. Molina: Sure. I'll let Joe talk about the technical, but some of the initiatives that we've undertaken, we expect to gain traction in July and August. Joe, you want to comment further?
James W. Howatt: Yes, I think that the best way to look at it, first of all, when we talk about the $14 million loss for -- as a base, that includes certain indirect costs that are not included in part of a premium deficiency reserve. You factor that in with the savings we think have already started kicking in, in July. And that's how we worked out of that number.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So I guess, thinking about RFPs, pipeline and other big dual contracts, based on what's going on now in the amount of resources, I assume, you need in Texas and Wisconsin, et cetera, are you thinking about, perhaps, waiting on some of these RFPs or even not negotiating contracts for things that you may already have won, et cetera?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, Josh, this is Mario. I'm not sure that's really an option. The expansion in California involves the existing health plans. And since we are an existing contractor, we're going to have to meet that. We have already responded to the RFP in Ohio. The good news there is that the regions where we came in first are the same regions where we currently have our operations. So we feel pretty comfortable about that since it doesn't involve new service areas. Remember that we went to a new service area in Hidalgo where we had no experience.
John C. Molina: And Josh, let me add one other very important point. And that is with Texas and, to a lesser extent, Wisconsin, our troubles are primarily rate related. And when we look at it, the Duals in California, for example, the governor, in his budget proposal, put out the expectation that dual savings would amount to 3%, I think, after the third year. CMS also has put out some expectations where they believe the savings will be 1% or 2%. In Hidalgo, the state expected the STAR+ would be 20% day one and that's comprised of various components, but they expected a 30% decrease in the long-term care services from day one. We had an 11% decrease in the Wisconsin plan effective last year. So we don't think that the pricing problems that we've run into in Texas and Wisconsin are going to be carried over to some of the Duals.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I guess, John, but -- you can call it a rate issue, but maybe it's a data issue, right? I mean, Texas seems to be bad data. I mean, there's no way you'd be off by that much in terms of savings and it seems like they just have their data wrong. So California doesn't have the greatest track record around rates. My understanding is you're still working on that rate decrease. I don't think you've gotten final rates that will have to come back retroactively once you report Q3, et cetera. So it just seems like there's higher risk. I'm just wondering how you guys are thinking about -- is it -- I guess, maybe in some of these states, it's not feasible to slow it down, but are you going to slow down sort of future RFPs beyond that?
Joseph Mario Molina: I think that's a great question, Josh. And here, I think, is one of the differences. In California, we are operating in the existing markets. We do have data on the Medicare side. So we do have better, I think, utilization data. When we look at Texas, specifically in Hidalgo, the state gave us no utilization data despite our asking for it. They simply gave us a PMPM. So we made our estimates based on what was happening in the rest of the state in the markets that we had already been serving. And what we saw was the utilization, the number of beneficiaries utilizing long-term care service is -- in our other markets, range from 11% on the low end to 20% on the high end. So when we look into the rates adequate, we thought they would be assuming that the same percentage of people in Hidalgo were using it in other areas, which led us to believe that it was really a overutilization of services. What we found once we got in there, was that 60% of the people in Hidalgo are utilizing long-term care services. It’s a much different issue that we have to tackle because we have to go out now on every one of those people and do a home visit. So you are absolutely right that data -- our ability to see data, our ability to analyze the data will be critical, and in each of our discussions with the states, that's what we've been talking to them about. We have experiencing in California. Ohio, we're fortunate that they have probably the best rate setting experience of any state we're in there, totally transparent. And then in Michigan, which is another duals state that we're looking at, we currently have experienced because the state enrolled the Duals into Medicaid Health Plans for their Medicaid non-long-term care benefits. So again, it's we're getting actual experience which I think will help us.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: All right. I think that will make sense. And then just lastly, one of your peers, when they reduced their guidance there were some relatively large offsets in the G&A that they were able to save some of those incentive comps, et cetera. I'm just curious, are you guys seeing any of those business -- operating costs or SG&A cost reductions that could be helping out a little bit in the short-term?
John C. Molina: We are certainly looking at things, like variable comp, and reducing it in order to help meet our targets.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: But no sizing of that or...
John C. Molina: No. We generally don't size up variable comp.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Can you just flush out the long-term care continuity of care period and what you guys can change versus you can't change? So if someone under the pay-for-service system were, sort of, prescribed to a nursing home, now that they're in the facility during the entire 6 months, what can you do and what can't you do?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, first of all -- this is Mario. The patients that we're recovering under long-term care are not institutionalized. So these are patients receiving community-based, long-term care services. And we must ensure continuation of prior authorized services for up to 6 months after the operational start date or until we've conducted a new assessment and new authorizations are issued. So as John points out, a lot of this is going into the home and doing a reassessment. But for the problem service, which is long-term care services, the period is 6 months, not 90 days. We are prior authorizing all the services that we have the ability to prior authorize. And we have been doing that since Day 1. For example, in-patient acute stays [ph]. That's something that we have been able to deal with. But the real problem are these in-home health services and there is a 6-month continuity care provision in the contract.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: But those -- they can't be at this point, even though it's not, you’re not 6 months through into it. There cannot be any new services -- in-home services prescribed without you guys pre-approving them? Is that correct?
Joseph Mario Molina: That's correct. And the problem is not the new services, the problem is the services that we inherited from the state. As John pointed out, about 18% of the beneficiaries in the STAR+ program in other regions of the state are receiving these services. It's close to 60% in the Hidalgo service area. So it's more than 3x the utilization rate that it is in other parts of the state.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And did you guys -- have you guys looked into -- I know Centene talked about that but saw -- see any unusual activity in terms of, sort of, I guess I'd call prescribing of services right before -- I know you guys weren't officially the managed care company, but is there any evidence of sort of aggressive provider behavior at this point?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, I would say yes and no. Are we aware of any aggressive provider behavior? No. Do we believe that the Hidalgo service area is an outlier compared to the rest of the state? And the answer would be clearly, yes.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And then to switch gears onto California. Can you just remind us the right cycle there? And I know their timing is somewhat difficult to, sort of, pick it out in terms of the rates. So what do you have in hand now in terms of rate changes for the state and what should we expect coming down the pike in the next 3 to 6 months?
John C. Molina: Okay. We have, essentially, 2 contract types in California. One is a 2-plan model, which would be Riverside and San Bernardino counties and Los Angeles County. And then the GMC Program, which is San Diego and also Sacramento County. In the GMC contract cycle, the rates begin in January 1. In the 2-plan model counties, the rates go into effect October 1. We have not received any written communication on rates from the state so far. So we really don't have anything, and the fellow that's responsible for rates for the state of California is on vacation until August 1. So we don't expect to get anything before then.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And then just real quick and I'll step back. What's the membership breakdown between the 2 cycles? Or better still, the revenue breakdown between the 2 cycles in California?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, the revenue breakdown -- I think, what you're saying is the PMPM premium rates, they're similar in both programs. They're just slightly different in terms of how the state does the contracts and when they deliver the rates to us. About 70% of our members are in 2 plan.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: I understand how cumbersome some of the in-home visits to reevaluate can be. But is there any flexibility available in temporarily staffing up nurses? I think you already mentioned each nurse can do 2 per day, so is there anything that you could be working on from that front to sort of get through that bottleneck?
Terry P. Bayer: Sarah, its Terry Bayer. First of all, I recognize that there's a certification -- a RN certification that's required for the nurses. So it isn't just any nurse on some of the assessments that have to do with determining which program a patient should be participating in. So it's not as simple as just adding bodies. We are sending out some of the services. We are pulling resources from other parts of the state. And we're doing what we can to get these folks reassessed as quickly as we can. The reassessments, I think back to the earlier comment, these are about determining whether the services are appropriate. And it's really about matching the hours that are assigned with that patient's needs. And secondarily, being certain that they are in the proper program, and by being in the right program, there are funding differences. So the assessments become very important.
John C. Molina: Sarah, this is John. Let me follow up on that. That's another rate-related issue that we really didn't highlight because the fix is longer-term. But when Terry talks about getting people on the right program, the state assumes a certain split of membership into what they call the waiver versus non-waiver programs. We did not get that same level of enrollment. So when they created the rates, they assumed x percent of our patients will be waiver and y percent will be non-waiver. That pricing difference to us really cost us. The cost being soft. Really resulted in $2 million of less revenue than what the state expected us to get. So that also added onto our problems in Q2.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Got it. That makes sense. And then in Wisconsin, I just wanted to understand what was going on in the rates there, specifically, because last quarter it was highlighted as a -- one of the legacy states that's doing well. I think in the first quarter of '11, you took a premium deficiency with the non-state. Was the difference now just that premium deficiency reserve is rolling off and that's why you have to take another one? And is that something that's inherited in negotiations with the state that it could be a pattern that recurs?
John C. Molina: We're hoping that it's not going to be a pattern that recurs because I think the state has seen how their rate setting has affected the plans. In fact, one of our competitors is exiting a couple of regions with a significant population because they couldn't get the rates that they wanted and the state's struggling to find other folks that will sign up, other plans that would sign up. So we have had a lot of discussions with the state. It's a small state and because of that, there's a lot of volatility in the medical costs. And so it was at this time that we looked out, and what we expected the future to be for this rate year, and decided to take the premium deficiency reserve.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: And then last question is I was looking over budget proposals for Louisiana, and one of the proposed items was a $1 million cut for the MMIS contract there. And I'm just wondering -- from an operational perspective, I know that when there is cuts within managed care there can be some offsets with the fee schedule where it passed through. Is that same opportunity -- are there pass-throughs that are available with that type of contracts to maintain margin and freeing [ph] that when it's finalized?
Terry P. Bayer: Sarah, its Terry. The only comment I have is sometimes changes to an MMIS vendor are tied to service changes, so the state takes back things and then the MMIS vendor isn't required to do it anymore. So there are adjustments that are occurring but it is generally by either claims processing or authorization programs or other things that the vendor does on behalf of the state. And I do know, Louisiana is under an effort to really contain its costs, and is looking to take back some smaller functionality. But then we would reduce our cost as a vendor. We wouldn't have the same obligations. As far as the past-through aspect of that, I don't have any information.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Green of Bank of America.
Scott J. Green - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Could you give us an update on how the Dallas STAR+ market is steering, maybe what the MLR there was in the quarter? And what progress you might be managing on long-term care services in that county?
Joseph Mario Molina: Hi, Scott, this is Mario. We don't break out reporting at that level. Suffice it to say, the primary problem that we have in Texas is with the STAR+ members in the Hidalgo and the El Paso service area.
Scott J. Green - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. So that -- so suggesting that Dallas might be improving from where it had been running in the last few quarters then? Because that would -- just trying to think about, to the extent you're showing progress there on those same services, that could give people optimism that you can achieve the same medical management efficiencies elsewhere in the state.
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, clearly we had problems when we first got into the Dallas STAR+ market; I think things there have stabilized. But one of the big differences is 18% of the STAR+ patients in the Dallas service area are receiving personal attendant services. 58% of the patients in the Hidalgo service area are receiving these same services. So it's really an apples-and-oranges comparison. The utilization is markedly different.
Scott J. Green - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. The provider contract changes in Texas that you outlined in the press release, is that -- have you already announced those or implemented those? I guess, what's the status? Can we count on them as, kind of, signed, sealed and delivered? If you could explain that.
Joseph Mario Molina: This is Mario, again. It's on a rolling basis. There was one large hospital recontracting effort that was completed in June. There's another one that is underway but we terminated that hospital system, and that will take about 2 more months before we see the results of that. There were a number of other contract changes that went into effect July 15. So they're being phased in over time but many of them are already in place.
Scott J. Green - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. All right. And then maybe could you speak to the management team in Michigan? I think you might have moved some of that personnel into Texas. I don't know if that may or may not have been related to the step up in MLR sequentially in Michigan. But just how do you feel about that market going forward?
Terry P. Bayer: Sure. This is Terry. Just to clarify for everyone. I think we announced Craig Bass, who was the President of our Michigan health plan, was one of our strongest presidents, showed interest in going back to Texas where we had actually recruited him from. And he was able to step up and become our new plan president in Texas. Our changes in Michigan were driven by asking Craig, and his agreeing to take the lead where he's been able to move forward with all of the plans in place. Now, again we were fortunate. We were able to move our health plan president from Wisconsin over to Michigan. This is an individual, Stephen Harris, who has been with us for a number of years. A native of Michigan. And where just that plan is continuing, he was -- it was a very smooth transition. And we'll be announcing a replacement for Wisconsin, shortly.
John C. Molina: Also, I think. Joe, do you want to comment on the changes in Michigan related to the premium tax?
James W. Howatt: Essentially, Michigan changed its premium tax regimen effective April 1, 2012. Where, essentially, they amended the premium tax and reduced premium rates, essentially, dollar-per-dollar. So what you're going to see is that impact was about 5%. So, all other things being equal, you'd see about a 5% increase in MCR in Michigan between Q1 of this year and Q2.
Joseph Mario Molina: But on a PMPM basis the medical costs are basically flat in Michigan.
James W. Howatt: So that would wash out by the time we got into admin and remove the premium tax.
Scott J. Green - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. Okay. Got it. And lastly, could you talk about the SG&A ratios? Your original guidance was 7.8% for the year and it's about 8.75% to-date. How much of that do you think might be potentially nonrecurring in nature as we head into next year? Maybe if it’s initial medical management efforts that once in place you won't need to allocate the same resources or litigation matters in Ohio or Missouri?
Joseph Mario Molina: This is Mario. One of the things that we're learning about with the ABDs and the Duals is that while they're also high utilized as medical services, they also drive up the admin cost a little bit. For example, we know that they use telephone advice lines about 5x more than the TANF members and the calls are markedly longer. So we just have more people spending more time on the phone with those members. Also, they generate a lot more claims. And so it's creating additional work in the claims systems. So there is some ramp up with the ABDs and the Duals that will come on the admin side as well.
Scott J. Green - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. Actually I just thought of one more, just real quick if that's okay. I just wanted to make sure that -- are any of your cash flows or receivables -- would any of that be potentially at risk in San Bernardino associated with its bankruptcy filing?
Joseph Mario Molina: No.
John C. Molina: We deal with the state and that's the City of San Bernardino that's filing for bankruptcy.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I just want to get back to the $14 million operating loss in Texas, and what you've done to improve that. I want to make sure I understand it completely. You also had a $14 million of unfavorable PPD and $10 million premium deficiency charge in the quarter. Just to be clear, that $24 million of extra cost, that's not included in the $14 million operating, is that correct?
Joseph Mario Molina: That is correct.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then in terms of the operating loss, in terms of getting that back to breakeven. You have the Management Services fees included in that, are there profits to Molina inside that Management Services contract, so that the goal was only to get it back to breakeven in Texas? Or do you intend -- or do you want to see Texas get to profitability eventually?
Joseph W. White: This is Joe, speaking. Of course, we intend to get Texas to profitability. But to your first question, there is no profit margin that goes into our Management Service fees. They are priced at cost.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. So then -- If we just look at the steps that you've outlined to get yourselves back to sort of breakeven in Texas, it, sort of, takes us to December of this year. Can you explain what's going to happen when we get past December into 2013? What additional steps are there? And is it hurdles for you, just from the brighter contract changes and the other initiatives that you talked about here getting it back to breakeven? Is that a big step? Is that little steps that you're doing? And is there more you can do in 2013 and how complicated is it to make it -- make Texas become a profitable market sometimes in 2013?
John C. Molina: I think the first step is let's get it to breakeven and we've laid out that plan. The second thing that we know is utilization changes tend to take longer than changing contracts. So Mario talked about some of the utilization initiatives that we've undertaken on the acute care side. It's going to take us longer to get utilization down on a long-term care side. In addition, I talked about the revenue adjustments based on getting more people from one program to another, assuming that they qualify, but the state data suggests that we have an imbalance there. And I think that the utilization changes that we're implementing will have a long-term positive effect and bring us above breakeven, but to what extent we can bake those in by the end of the year, we don't know, which is why we've left guidance where we have.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: So you sort of -- can you give me a good read on to how complicated do you think it is to -- just to get it to breakeven? Is that -- are you moving mountains to get that done? Are you doing some simple blocking and tackling? Where is that relative to what you need to do down the road to get this thing back to something that's earning money for the company?
Joseph Mario Molina: This is Mario. First of all, I want to thank you and everybody else on call for your patience. This is a very difficult task because, as John pointed out, the problems are not unit cost related as much as they are utilization. A lot of this is in the long-term care service area where we have to go in and reevaluate people on a member-by-member basis. And you're talking about tens of thousands of members that are eligible for these services. There are other things that we will do, and we've sort of outlined some of the major things that we're doing to get us back to a breakeven point. We do have the rate increase coming September 1. We're looking at other services as well. And I think that, over the long term, that's where the final difference will be made. Things like in-patient hospital services, laboratory services, physical therapy, but the major thrust for us right now is to bring down the costs on the personal attendants services and that means doing a lot of reassessments. And as John also mentioned, we have been told by the state to expect to lose about 8,000 of these STAR+ members in August. I think Centene mentioned on their call they're picking up about 5,000. So certainly some of the patients are being redistributed from Molina to the other health plans. That will lighten our load a little bit, but it's going to put a greater strain on other health plans. We're going to have to go in and do the same kinds of one-on-one in-home evaluations.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: That's helpful. So I'm looking at sort of the, I guess, the $3.2 million on the other initiatives. That's really sort of only part way there in terms of the one-on-one evaluations and it seems you got more of that due in 2013?
John C. Molina: I also think that one of the things that will help when we eventually get the full funding for the Duals is being able to manage the Medicare portion. We're not getting the Medicare premiums, and frankly, we have done a pretty good job in the past of managing acute medical services, both for Medicaid and Medicare. So as we get more revenue on the acute side service, when we get the full revenues stream [ph] from the Duals, I think that would help us well.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And lastly in Michigan...
Joseph Mario Molina: Peter, I don't want to beat this too much but recall we do believe that the initiatives that we've got in place, plus the rate increase, will allow us to get to breakeven by year end. So that's still a pretty short timeframe to get back to breakeven. And then some of the longer-term initiatives hopefully will start gaining traction, but they’ll carry us through to 2013.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then back to Michigan, even without the premium tax it looks like that deteriorated a little bit from the first quarter to the second quarter. Is there anything more to that [indiscernible] or what else is going on there?
Joseph W. White: Yes. It's Joe speaking. It was -- we normally don't delve into components but they certainly -- the Medicare lies [ph] were a bit expensive in second quarter. We also had a higher hospital utilization for the quarter. I don't think it was anything out of the -- it wasn't welcomed but I don't think it was anything representing a serious trend.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies.
David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Just wanted to clarify a little bit more on Texas. So it seems like we've referred to Hidalgo a lot. I want to make sure I understand that, basically your issues, the elevated long-term care services, the longer continuity of care provisions are applicable to both of these regions, Hidalgo and El Paso. Is that correct?
Joseph Mario Molina: That's correct.
David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then in terms of your losses in the state, it looks like, just following the financials, was $14,000 a month -- $14 million a month, excuse me. And then only a portion of that is -- matching that up against your premium and medical cost schedule, it looks like your losses in the quarter, on an underwriting basis were about $10 million, your losses overall would have been about $42 million and the difference is indirect cost, is that correct?
Joseph W. White: Sorry, I'm not following that calculation.
David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: So if I look at your -- Maybe I can take that one off-line. I'll just take that one off-line. What is your borrowing availability? Josh asked the question about capital, but what's your current borrowing availability?
John C. Molina: We have $170 million revolver. We've withdrawn $50 million of that as noted in the press release. The remainder would be free.
David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. Sorry I missed that. And then finally on the Texas prior period development. It sounds like that mostly arose because you were using, kind of, theoretical numbers, as oppose to actual claims data. I'm just wondering how confident you are that your reserves, as they're stated at June 30, are adequate to not have prior period development unfavorable beyond this point?
Joseph Mario Molina: Sure, that's a good observation. I think if you look back historically, when we have the data available, we typically run positive prior period development. So our expectation, now that we have 4 months worth of data in the new service areas and the new benefits, is that we are adequately reserved, and we should start to see positive prior period development next quarter as has been our history.
David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: And the claims, just to clarify on this point, the claims on the long-term care services that are running high, are those fast cycle claims or slow? Can you give visibility on those pretty quick?
Joseph Mario Molina: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Melissa McGinnis with Morgan Stanley.
Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Maybe switching focus from Texas for a little bit. Can you talk a bit about your commentary on Washington? It sounded like things are going better than some of your very conservative guidance on that state that you put out at the beginning of the year. And I just wanted to better understand what's really helping Molina defend market share there and/or at the same time what's challenging some of your new competitors to gaining scale more like quickly?
Joseph W. White: Well, the enrollment has definitely come in a little higher than anticipated. We initially projected some losses in enrollment. Beyond that, I wouldn't draw too many conclusions. In terms of competitive position, I think that we have been in that state for many years, and have very strong networks and deep provider relationships. And that's what's, I think, been most helpful to us.
Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. Great. And then can you just remind us, we went through quite a re-procurement cycle with Molina this year. And can you remind us, I think there is one more re-procurement coming up with New Mexico but one is outright. When exactly is that coming up? And then are there any others on that time horizon that we need to be watching?
Terry P. Bayer: This is Terry. For New Mexico, it's always -- we're just relying on latest information we have from the state is it will be out in the fall, so we expect it quite soon. And no other information any other re-procurements of our existing business in the short term.
Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then a final one. Just thinking about the duals and thinking about some of the challenges this year in Texas. In your initial conversations with the various states where you've already, like, been on business or been in conversations about contracts that are going to be put in force next year. What are the views around continuity of care provisions there? Some people early on were thinking continuity of care would be even stricter with the dual eligible population, and are you comfortable with what might be assumed in rates and then how much your hands are tied early on in those contracts?
Joseph Mario Molina: Yes. I would just say this. I think the -- part of the problem in Texas -- this is Mario again -- was a mismatch between the actuaries and the policy people. So I think the actuaries made certain assumptions, and the policy people made certain decisions and they weren't in concert. I would be careful about extrapolating too much from Texas. I think that this is an important state and I think that the other states are watching this and they’re learning from this. CMS has come out with some guidelines where they're expecting savings on the Duals to be 1% to maybe 5% over the period of 3 years. State of California has mentioned that they think that in their initiatives here in California, they're talking 3% to 6% over 3 years. So I think people are being -- are watching what's happened in Texas and learning from it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Wright with Monness Crespi Hardt.
Brian Wright: How many nurses are currently involved in doing the in-home assessments in Hidalgo and El Paso?
Joseph Mario Molina: Brian, there are lots and lots of nurses on the ground doing these things. This has been probably our single highest priority in Texas and we began this shortly after the go-live date. I mean, we were initially surprised that we got more members than we had anticipated. We are -- so -- but we didn't -- so we saw this coming, we just didn't see it coming to the magnitude that we did. And as Terry points out, you have to have trained nurses, it's not just any nurse.
Brian Wright: Well I'm just trying to get a better kind of gauge on how many people you could see over the next couple of months to incrementally improve things between now and the end of the year.
Joseph Mario Molina: I'm not going to estimate how many evaluations we're going to be doing on a daily or weekly basis. Suffice it to say, we recognize the problem. We're putting as many resources on this as we can. And it's just going to take some time.
Brian Wright: Okay. And then I know you're not giving guidance but just help us because we have to model something. Given the one-time those [ph] kinds of things whether the unfavorable part about men or premium deficiency reserves, I mean, that looks like about 35 [ph], roughly $1 million in the quarter, should we be thinking about a positive EBITDA in the next quarter?
John C. Molina: Brian, I know you guys can't model and we withdrew that kind of guidance, so we can't give it to you. I think we've given you the inputs on what we think is going to be onetime. And where our plan is to get back, largely in Texas, to profitability. But beyond that, we really can't comment.
Brian Wright: Okay. Not even directionally?
Joseph Mario Molina: We think things are going to get better.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Carl McDonald with Citigroup.
Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: What's the latest thinking on the investment spending that you're planning on in California ahead of the dual eligible rollout? And then just in the magnitude, if you've got a sense of the timing and anything that's sort of included in the -- and I know you're not giving guidance, but included in the current forecast versus what would be additive to that?
Joseph Mario Molina: Carl, a lot of that is baked in; that's why admin costs are running higher right now, because we're preparing for the Duals that are going to come we think second quarter of 2013 in California. It's not an RBC state, it's a little bit different so we do have to make sure that we're going to have adequate reserves, but the formula is a little bit different than it is in other states. Suffice it to say Terry, Lisa Rubino, who is the Regional Vice President, and Richard Chambers, who is our current California President, are working very diligently to prepare us for that.
Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And anything new on the California Dual process that you think is worth highlighting? So -- for example, any update on rate development and/or how the subcontracting with Healthnet will work in terms of what the [indiscernible]?
Joseph Mario Molina: We don't have a lot of new information yet, Carl. And the reason I say that is that right now, the state is still negotiating with CMS over the parameters of the plan. So until they finish their negotiations, we're not going to get to the details of how the plan will roll out, or what the rates are going to be.
John C. Molina: I do want to just jump in here and remind everybody that in addition to L.A. and San Diego, in this latest budget there, the state of California has included San Bernardino and Riverside. So we are in the 3 most populous counties or 4 of the 8 most populous counties that will participate.
Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then a separate question on California. WellPoint mentioned on their call that they'd come to verbal agreement with the state on some new rates. I heard the bit about you guys haven't heard at what your updated rates will look like, but be interested how you've been booking your rates. WellPoint also mentioned that the higher rates they'd be getting would be retroactive, that they've been booked into lower reimbursements that would give them some additional upside. To the extent that your rates are higher and retroactive, would you also expect to see some upside relative to what you've been accruing?
John C. Molina: Carl, this is John. Let me go back. Recall last year the state put in some rate decreases, the providers protested, some of the advocates protested, and that has gone up to the Supreme Court and then back down. We booked our revenue as though the provider rate decreases were intact. So we have a liability. If the state came back and said that they were not going to take -- they were not going to change the provider rates, then theoretically, our rates, on a retroactive basis, would go up and we would be able to book that. We have not heard that, that is within their plan right now. Maybe what WellPoint is talking about is a good sign for us.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back over to you, Dr. Molina.
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your patience in getting through all those calls. I want to remind you that we have our Investor Day coming up in September and invite you to attend that. We'll have more color on Texas, I'm sure, at that point. And well, this has been a difficult quarter. We're not happy with the results. I think in the long run, we're well-positioned. We're gaining a lot of experience with the ABDs and the Duals. We're in markets where we're going to see a lot of growth, even without any kind of Medicaid expansion in the Affordable Care Act. So we have an optimistic outlook on the future. So we'll see you at Investor Day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a good day, everyone.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Molina Healthcare First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Monday, April 30, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Juan José Orellana, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan Jose Orellana: Thank you, Francisco. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare's financial results for the first quarter, ended March 31, 2012. The company's earnings release reporting its results was issued today after the market closed and is now posted for viewing on our company website. Participating for Molina today will be Dr. Mario Molina, our CEO; John Molina, our CFO; Terry Bayer, our COO; and Joseph White, our Chief Accounting Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. [Operator Instructions]. Our comments today will contain forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities litigation Reform Act, including statements regarding our Ohio contract appeal, our Texas and California operations, our expansion opportunities with regards to dual eligible integration programs and our earnings per share guidance for 2012. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our form 10-K annual report for fiscal year 2011, our form 10-Q quarterly reports and our Form 8-K current reports. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab of our company website or on the SEC's website. All forward-looking statements made during today's call represent our judgment as of April 30, 2012, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements.  This call is being recorded, and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available over the Internet through the company's website at molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina.
Joseph Mario Molina: Thank you, Juan José. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our conference call today. We are pleased that our financial results for the first quarter of 2012 met our expectations. In addition, we're excited about the progress being made with the integration of dual eligible beneficiaries into programs across the country. We believe that our participation in such managed care growth opportunities will contribute to the long-term growth prospects for our company.  Before we get further into discussing the quarter and the opportunities ahead of us, I would like to take a moment to talk about our Ohio Medicaid contract. Recently, the Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services notified our Ohio health plan that it had not been selected for a contract under the recent Ohio Medicaid managed care Request For Applications or RFA. As a result of not being selected, our existing contract with the state will expire without renewal on December 31, 2012. However, since the contract remains in place until the end of this year, it will not have a negative impact on our full year 2012 estimates of $1.75 per share, which we reaffirmed today. Although we're disappointed with this outcome, Molina Healthcare remains committed to serving the state of Ohio, our providers and, most importantly, our members. Molina has pursued its rights of appeal and has filed, as have 4 other health plans, a formal protest with the Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services. Our protest challenges the scoring of Molina's submission pursuant to the RFA and identifies scoring errors that, if corrected, could alter the previously announced RFA results. While the exact timing of a potential resolution to our protest remains uncertain, we believe that a ruling should occur relatively soon, given the implementation timelines and readiness requirements of the program. Now let's get back to our first quarter results. Earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $0.39 per share or $18 million in net income. Our established health plans continue to perform well, and as we are even more strongly engaged in key states such as Texas and California. Revenues at our Texas plan more than doubled when compared to the first quarter 2011, adding nearly $1 billion in new annualized revenues and 125,000 new members as part of the managed care expansion which went into effect March 1 of this year. As a reminder, late last year, we won new contracts to administer the STAR and STAR+ programs in the El Paso and Rio Grande Valley service areas as well as the STAR and CHIP programs in the Dallas service area.  At the end of the first quarter, our Texas health plan became Molina's third-largest health plan in terms of both the revenue and enrollment. In addition, our preliminary enrollment data for the month of April suggest that Texas health plan could become our second largest plan in the not-too-distant future.  In California, our health plan revenues grew at about 20% year-over-year, with the addition of over 23,000 new ABD lives as the result of the transition of seniors and persons with disabilities or SPDs, as we call them in California, into managed care. We're very excited about our participation in this program. It solidifies our current base as well as builds on our experience in arranging for healthcare services for patients with more complex healthcare needs. As we have highlighted in the past, scale and experience with more complex patients are key competencies that strongly position Molina to capitalize on one of the largest growth opportunities for Managed Care: The integration of the dual eligible beneficiaries into managed care.  The value of participating in the California Medicaid program, our growing experience with ABD enrollment and the inclusion of duals into managed care are strategic imperatives that we have been stressing with the investor community for quite some time. But it was not until earlier this month that all of these related strategic priorities converged.  All of our efforts came to fruition when the California Department of Health Care Services announced its initial selection of the first 4 counties and the health plans which will participate in the state's dual eligible care coordination demonstration project. I'm pleased to report that Molina was selected to participate as an integrated health plan for its duals demonstration project in San Diego County, where approximately 75,000 dual eligible beneficiaries reside. In addition, Molina will also participate in the duals demonstration project for Los Angeles County as a subcontracted health plan. Nearly 374,000 dual eligible beneficiaries reside in Los Angeles County. Enrollment across the 4 selected counties is scheduled to begin in January of 2013. A key feature of the California dual eligible proposal is that the initial participation in the program is restricted to health plans that currently participate in the state's Medicaid program. This approach is very similar to that implemented in the managed care transition for California's SPD members, where the state chose to work with health plans that have existing contracts with the state for the Medicaid program.  Next, the state will be submitting its proposal to CMS for approval in May, and a response from CMS is expected in the month of June. While California leads the nation's efforts to integrate duals into Managed Care, other states are rapidly following. In Texas, the state released earlier this month its initial proposal to begin moving its dual eligible beneficiaries into managed care. The Texas Health and Human Services Commission estimates that there are approximately 214,000 dual eligible beneficiaries that will be included in the demonstration project. Similar to California, participation in the Texas duals demonstration will be initially limited to health plans that have both a STAR+ agreement with the state and a Medicare Advantage Special Needs Plan agreement with CMS. As of March 31, Molina Healthcare Texas served approximately 109,000 STAR+ members, making us the second largest STAR+ contractor in the state of Texas. Our enrollment in our SNP product in Texas has also grown steadily. We believe our scale and experience coordinating benefits for the STAR+ membership as well as our dedicated focus on Special Needs Plans will provide a strong foundation for the proposed demonstration in Texas. Texas is expected to submit its application to CMS at the end of May, and enrollment is currently scheduled to begin in January of 2014. Last week, the state of Ohio released its Request for Applications or RFA for the Ohio Integrated Care Delivery System or ICDS, which comprehensively manages Medicare and Medicaid benefits for the dual eligible beneficiaries in that state. The ICDS program will be implemented in select regions across the state starting in January of 2013 and covers nearly 115,000 beneficiaries. In this pilot, the Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services will select health plans for each of the 7 regions in the state through a competitive application process that will be due on May 25. Notification of scoring results is tentatively scheduled for June 18. It is important to mention that the Ohio dual eligible opportunity is not restricted to health plans holding Ohio Medicaid contracts. Therefore, regardless of the outcome of our outstanding protests related to Ohio's Medicaid contract award, Molina Healthcare would not be excluded as an eligible applicant for the Ohio ICDS. Instead, the application requirement as outlined in the RFA requires that if the applicant does not offer Medicaid Managed Care services in the state, then it must currently serve at least 100,000 lives across all lines of business in all states. The requirements also identify that an applicant must currently maintain a CMS-approved Medicare Advantage plan.  As evidenced by the growth in dual eligible opportunities in our field and the proposed expansion of Medicaid in the coming years, federal and state governments now recognize that individuals receiving care in a -- on a fee-for-service basis through government programs are ideal candidates for Managed Care. As these opportunities in the government healthcare sector continue to grow increasingly attractive, we can expect the competition in our industry will intensify. Our recent challenges with the contract award in Ohio and Missouri are byproducts of a highly competitive industry. On a level playing field, we welcome the competition.  The dual eligible growth opportunity is an attractive one. However, serving the healthcare needs of these complex patients is not for every company, and it takes more than just experience with Medicare to be successful. We believe we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of this growth opportunity. Our operation of dual eligible Special Need Plans since 2006, our participation in the acclaimed Washington Medicaid Integration Partnership for the ABDs since 2005 and our growing understanding of long-term care with the Texas STAR+ program have honed our skills in serving complex patients. Our experience with these patients combined with our 32-year history of arranging for the healthcare needs of low-income Medicaid patients makes the expansion of Managed Care to the dual eligible beneficiaries a natural extension of our business. In summary, despite the issues associated with the Ohio contract awards, which we are pursuing in our appeal, this is a good first quarter operationally and a strong start to 2012 for Molina Healthcare. The performance at our established health plans was excellent, and our recent wins in California, Texas and Washington combined with the near-term activity surrounding the dual eligible population continue to strengthen our growth profile.  As always, we remain focused on diversification among our 3 lines of business: Health plans, our clinics and our fiscal agents. Not only does diversification drive growth, it also helps mitigate risk with regard to our revenue stream. Our industry is one that is witnessing a considerable amount of growth. While identifying growth opportunities is central to our business, we remain equally committed to operating our core business. We undoubtedly have more work to do, but we're excited about 2012 and remain confident, as ever, in the future potential of Molina Healthcare.  I would now like to turn the call over to John, our CFO, to discuss our first quarter financial results in more detail.
John C. Molina: Thank you, Mario. Good afternoon, everyone. Our financial performance this quarter provides a good start towards achieving our 2012 guidance. As Mario pointed out, improved premium revenues and enrollment were the hallmarks of the quarter. Profitability metrics such as earnings per share, operating income and, more importantly, EBITDA, all experienced modest year-over-year improvements despite a continued weak premium rate environment and higher costs associated with assimilating new populations. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.39, up 3% from a year ago, while net income increased to $18 million or 4% over the previous years. EBITDA also increased by nearly 5% over the first quarter of 2011. Higher margin at the company's Molina Medicaid Solutions segment and higher revenues in the health plan segment contributed to these improvements. At the end of the quarter, our enrollment stood at 1.8 million members, with the bulk of the sequential enrollment gains coming from Texas, where the company began serving new STAR and STAR+ members in the Dallas, El Paso and Rio Grande Valley service areas effective March 1. Our Medicare plans grew by 7,100 or approximately 29% year-over-year. As a reminder, nearly 80% of our Medicare enrollment is in our Special Needs Plan. Marketing and outreach to this population is particularly challenging, as potential enrollees must be contacted one at a time, and many of them often have low education and literacy levels. Despite these challenges, we continued to consistently increase our SNP enrollment while gaining important experience in caring for this population. Consolidated premium revenue grew 23% to $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same period last year due to a 7% increase in membership and a 15% increase in per-member per-month revenue due to mix shift. As Mario mentioned, the California plan added approximately 23,000 new ABD members since the first quarter of 2011, with the majority of these members joining in the plan in the last 9 months. Texas, on the other hand, added approximately 58,000 ABD members since the first quarter of 2011, with the majority of these new members joining the plan in March 2012. ABD members have higher per-member per-month premium revenues. The shift in our member mix is evident by the fact that 15% of the company's current enrollment is comprised of ABD members and Medicare members compared with just 11% of membership a year ago. Our consolidated medical care ratio increased to 85.2% in the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, compared with 84.5% in the same period last year. While the ABD members we have added in California and Texas have come with higher premiums, medical care costs are also higher for these members. Additionally, rate decreases of approximately 2% in Ohio, effective January 1, 2012, and approximately 3% in California, effective July 1, 2011, also contributed to a year-over-year increase in the medical care ratio. Many of our legacy health plans were able to achieve a higher medical margin in this quarter when compared to the first quarter of 2011. Despite the shift in member mix in Texas, the medical care ratio at our Texas health plan actually decreased both year-over-year and sequentially to 90.8%. This is consistent with the expectations for Texas that we outlined at our Investor Day, which assumed that the performance of our existing book of business would improve with longer tenure.  Also as we expected, the higher medical costs associated with new populations will be partially offset by rate increases associated with the health plans assumptions of in-patient and pharmacy risk for all existing populations. As a reminder, our guidance assumes a medical care ratio for the Texas health plan at 90% for all of 2012. I want to remind everyone, however, that we've only had one month of experience in the new Texas regions and with the new pharmacy and in-patient benefits. In estimating expenses and setting claims reserves for the first quarter, we had to rely heavily upon historical data provided by the state's Medicaid agency in place of our own claims payment experience, which is almost nonexistent for the new regions and benefits. Performance at our MMS subsidiary improved in the first quarter due to the achievement of systems certification in Maine that had previously delayed revenue recognition, more effective cost controls, progress towards system stabilization in Idaho and Maine and lower purchase price amortization. General and administrative expenses for the quarter increased to 8.8% of total revenue compared with 8.4% of total revenue for the same quarter last year. The company incurred additional expenses in the first quarter of this year due to investment in administrative infrastructure in anticipation of opportunities in Texas and amongst the dual eligible population. Although there has been considerable amount of Medicaid RFP activity in the last 12 to 18 months, we remain very selective in our participation and mindful in the use of our resources. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $51 million for the first quarter of 2012, nearly 3x net income. The company had cash and investments of about $930 million, and the parent company had cash and investments of $40 million. Days and claims payable increased sequentially to 44 days. The increase was primarily driven by the establishment of higher reserves in connection with our Texas expansion, which was effective March 1. I want everyone to remember, though, that we calculate our days and claims payable on a rolling 12-month basis. That means that cost -- claims cost per day will continue to grow each month over the next 11 months as incremental medical costs associated with the Texas expansion are rolled into the calculation. Our claims payable liability, however, will likely remain the same or even shrink as the payment of claims begins to offset the increase that we have seen in our claims reserves this quarter.  As a result, the numerator in our DCP calculation, our claims liability, will be more or less constant, while the divisor, claims cost per day, rises over the next 11 months. Therefore, the expected result would be a decrease in our DCP over the next 11 months, all else being equal. The distortion of our DCP resulting from a substantial increase in membership in March illustrates one of the many weaknesses of the DCP calculation that we've spoken of in the past. We've always believed that a better measure of the adequacy of our claims reserves is to look back to the claims liabilities that we have previously reported, with the benefit of the hindsight we gained as we pay out claims over time. The roll-forward table we presented at the end of today's earnings release provides a good example.  As you can see, that table shows favorable development of our claims reserves was almost $37 million for the first quarter. The comparable number from last year was $44 million. Unfavorable prior-period development in Missouri of nearly $5 million this quarter was the main reason for the decrease in prior-period development quarter-over-quarter. We present this claims liability roll-forward table every quarter, and if you go back and review our prior reports, you will see that we've had a consistent record of maintaining adequate reserves. I will be talking more about this on future calls. In summary, we are pleased with the results of the first quarter and confident about our EPS guidance of $1.75 for the year, ended December 31, 2012.  This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I hate to do it, but I want to start in Ohio. I calculate the MLR somewhere just under 87.5, excluding premium taxes. So that's about almost 200 basis points above your overall, again, excluding premium taxes. So is it fair to assume that Ohio was less profitable than your overall book of business in terms of a percentage margin? Or are you expecting sort of improvements in that MLR as the year goes by and you fully anniversary the Rx?
John C. Molina: Josh, this is John. We don't talk about profitability on a state-by-state basis. Also with the -- removing the premium tax and then adding the pharmacy benefit in, it just gets kind of crazy. At this point, as Mario said, the potential loss of the Ohio contract is not going to impact 2012 guidance. We haven't made 2013 guidance, so we don't want to speculate. And frankly, we'd rather be hopeful that we're going to retrain that contract.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I guess, John -- I certainly appreciate that, but I guess we're talking about sort of a one-off situation here where you're previously largest state could be disappearing. I think it's pretty important to figure out the impact that, that could have. So at some point during the year, do you plan on quantifying that? Is that post-finding out about your appeal?
John C. Molina: Yes. We'd like to wait and see what happens with the appeal, Josh. Although you're correct to point out the difference in the cost, and part of that has to do with the implementation of the pharmacy benefits.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Right, right. I didn't know if that was normalized for the year or that just got added in October. Let's move on, I guess -- I'm sorry, I don't want to take waste time with that. The cash flow, I think you mentioned in the press release there were some timing-related issues. So I'm just curious, is there a quantification of how much benefit you saw from, I would guess, early payments from government partners?
Joseph W. White: Josh, it's Joe speaking. If you look at the cash flow statement, you can see, actually, that deferred revenue was less of a source of cash this time out than a quarter ago. First quarter of 2011, Ohio paid us early. That didn't happen this year. So if you want to look at other than net income and amortization, depreciation, the big factor is driving cash flow this year in a favorable sense for the increase in claims payable offset by less deferred revenue and also an increase in receivables tied to what's happening in California, where California has delayed, has essentially slipped via move-back their payment of premiums 1 month on a sliding basis.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And Joe, that $44.5 million that -- is that a fair number to use? I mean, I think there's usually a lot of moving parts in there. So I'm trying to figure out next quarter when it reverses how much of that -- how much of April was paid in March?
Joseph W. White: I would think that, that -- generally somebody always pays a day early. So I think it could carry forward that $44.5 million. I wouldn't necessarily expect it to all reverse.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then, I'm sorry, last question on the...
Joseph Mario Molina: Somebody will always pay a little bit early.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Sure. And John, I apologize, last question. Did you mention a slight unfavorable development in Missouri? And I was just curious what that was related to, if there's any expectation of that continuing?
John C. Molina: Josh, slight, it was $5 million. Part of that was due to one of our members had quintuplets, I believe, late last year, and we are still paying for those costs ongoing this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Charles Boorady from Crédit Suisse.
Charles Andrew Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: First question on Ohio. You mentioned the medical care margin decreased, and part of that was because of the higher loss ratio, the pharmacy carve-in. But if we look at dollar profits, is the dollar profitability of Ohio up or down year-over-year?
Joseph Mario Molina: Joe, do you know?
Joseph W. White: Charles, I'd have to check that. I know that obviously the MCR is up 180 basis points for the pharmacy, and then they took a 2% premium cut January 1. We'd have to just do the math on the back where we present our medical margins. Honestly, I don't have that number handy, but I think you can work it from the table in the back of the ER.
Charles Andrew Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. The pharmacy carve-in. Was that net additive to the dollar profitability, or was that a neutral?
John C. Molina: It's net additive. Again, it's generating a -- it's -- I think it's generating an MCR in the high 80s, so it's net additive.
Charles Andrew Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, got it. And then at your Investor Day, you gave a really helpful slide with the excess -- I think it was the capital by state. Ohio looked like it had a decent amount of excess capital. Does that picture look pretty consistent today with where it was at your Investor Day? And how should we think about that capital in the event of hypothetically, you're out of Ohio next year. Is that all excess cash that can be dividend in directly to the parent in January of 2013?
John C. Molina: We've got about -- at March 31, we've got about $120 million of total capital in Ohio. That's everything, that's not just excess. About $120 million of total, $80 million of excess. In the hypothetical situation that we were to exit Ohio, which obviously means that the failure of our appeal and the inability to get a dual eligible contract there, anything like that, we would start withdrawing that money, I think, in the first half of 2012, not all of it, but -- I mean 2013. Not all of it, but we'd start that process. That's a lot of hypotheticals there, though.
Charles Andrew Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Yes. No, but I appreciate that. And then Texas, final question, just Texas in the first quarter, about how much of your expenses there were due to startup costs? And of course, what would the quarter have looked like without the new Texas RFP had that never occurred?
Joseph W. White: If you wanted to look at -- it's Joe speaking, if you want to look at Texas costs and admin-related costs that we incurred without any related revenue, that ran about $2 million for the quarter. There's obviously additional costs at the parent, and that's a little bit harder to nail down, but if you want to drop something in your model, I'd figure another $0.5 million to $1 million at the parent.
Charles Andrew Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got it. And it's...
Joseph W. White: It's somewhere between about $2 million and $3 million, total.
Charles Andrew Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got it. Just to make sure I understand the days claims payable explanation correctly, we think about new lives coming in. And isn't it right that the new revenues come in well before expenses are actually paid for? So should -- is there a case to be made for an increasing days claims payable with growing enrollment? Or are you paying providers so quickly that, that doesn't actually happen?
John C. Molina: Charles, the enrollment has come in now. The large enrollment growth in Texas is largely over. And that's where we saw the run-up in the DCPs. There will be slight increases throughout the year, but nothing like what we had in March. So exactly what you talked about is going to happen. We had to build up an enrollment. Now, as we start paying the claims and getting a better track record, as we describe in the script, the denominator will go up, the numerator will go down slightly.
Charles Andrew Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I got it, I got it. So you're referring to the other end of that curve. Okay, very clear.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Carl McDonald with Citigroup.
Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: On the Los Angeles dual announcement, I'd be interested if you have a way of thinking at this point about how much of the enrollment HealthNet's likely to get in Los Angeles? I mean, how many duals will stay fee-for-service versus how many HealthNet will pick up? And then how you think about what percent of that will that get subcontracted out to you.
Joseph Mario Molina: This is Mario. It's a little bit difficult to say. We have a contract with HealthNet that specifies a certain percentage of the market share will be defaulted to us. And we expect it to be along the lines that the contract has used in the past. The problem, however, is we don't know what the duals enrollment will look like, because it is an opt-out. So we don't know what percentage of patients will opt out, and we're just going to have to wait and see.
Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Got it, okay. And then follow-up question on California, if you could just give us an update on where the legislature is in terms of the trailer bill that would extend from 4 counties to 10?
Joseph Mario Molina: That's a really good question. I don't know. We don't have the May revise of the budget yet. But I would expect that the budget is probably going to come in, in worse shape than we thought, that revenues are going to be weaker than anticipated and we'll put more pressure on the state to try to save money. One of the biggest costs the state of California has is the Medicaid program, and the biggest component they can do something about are the duals. I mean, they represent 15% of the patients and 40% of the costs. So I would expect that the state would have a good reason to accelerate the move of the duals into managed care.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel.
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I want to continue the line of questioning on the duals a bit here. And I'm wondering just as this opportunity continues to evolve, if we can start to get some more details, not just on California, but other places well. But let's start with California for now. What rate will Molina be paid when this gets implemented? And then, secondly, how will Molina operationally staff up to meet what will likely be a sizable outreach effort, if you will, on potentially thousands of chronically ill people? Those are the 2 things I want you to talk about.
John C. Molina: And so, Tom, let me take -- this is John. Let me take the first part of your question, and I'll let Terry handle the second part. Frankly, we don't know what the rates are going to be, because we don't know the full expanse of the benefits that the state's looking to put in nor how it's going to be coordinated with the Medicare piece. So at this point, it would just be a conjecture. And as you know, we don't like to do that.
Terry P. Bayer: And this is Terry to add a comment on the staffing. We have a model of care that we have scoped out for care of the population. So there are investments we're making now in the tools and the training and the system changes that have to be made and doing some preliminary planning on staffing. We're working with a range of estimates on the number of beneficiaries that will ultimately be enrolled, and as the months go on and we have more information, we will staff toward that. But certainly, we are putting in place supervisory and managerial positions so that we're ready to hire the frontline staff as we know how many.
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: So obviously, a big opportunity, perhaps. But I guess I struggle with a big program that we don't know what the price tag is on yet that will be focused on a lot of chronically ill people that have never been in managed care before. I guess internally, how do you think of this as an opportunity?
John C. Molina: We think about it as an opportunity, Tom, over the long haul. So there are certain things...
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: So long term [indiscernible]?
John C. Molina: Absolutely. Over time, we believe that our systems of care will allow us to lower the medical costs associated with these patients as compared to what they've experienced in fee-for-service. There is going to be a ramp-up, you're absolutely right, if that's what you're implying, in that we will manage it just as we have managed very large-scale implementations in places like Ohio and Texas before. But if people expect that on day one, it's going to be turning a profit that's equal to what we've done in the past, it's probably unrealistic.
Joseph Mario Molina: Yes, Tom, this is Mario. If you look at when we've brought new populations in, in the past, we have seen some pent-up demand. I think we're seeing that now with the new patients in California and Texas, the SPDs and the ABDs, and I would expect to see something along those lines with the dual eligible beneficiaries as well.
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Have you had a chance to maybe compare/contrast the California versus the Texas proposals? I know it's -- they're brand-new, but any commentary one versus the other?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, I don't know about comparing California with Texas, but we have been able to compare California ABDs -- the new ABDs versus ABDs that have been on the plan, and the new ones are running us a slightly higher costs. So there is some evidence for some pent-up demand. It's consistent with what we've seen in the past.
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: All right. And then one other -- just one other quick one, looks like MMS added nicely in the quarter. How should we think about EPS contribution from this business of yours? I mean, it looks about -- what, $0.10 a share in the quarter?
John C. Molina: Well, the problem with MMS is that it has been sort of up and down. And we haven't reached, I don't think, a consistent run rate yet. So it's a little bit difficult to say. Things are definitely improving. I think the fact that we got certification from Maine was a big landmark. We have had the site survey for Maine back in December -- I'm sorry, for Idaho back in December, and we're just awaiting certification. But we don't see any reason why that system shouldn't be certified as well, because it's essentially the same system that we had in Maine. And once we get the certification of both systems, I think things will stabilize, and we'll get more consistent earnings.
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Is my math right there, though? I mean, is it that simple as just looking at like $0.10 a share?
Joseph W. White: Yes. It's Joe speaking -- that's correct. You can assume about 750k pretax in the penny [ph].
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Is it possible to sort of spike out or isolate what the Texas MLR would have been on sort of a legacy basis? And then more importantly, give us a sense for what the Texas MLR will do sequentially on both sort of 2Q MLR versus Q1 as well as the year-to-year comparison, just given the enrollment didn't come on until March?
John C. Molina: Chris, this is John. We did not go back and try to reconstruct what it would've been absent the new populations and absent the benefits. So the answer to your first question is no. We would expect that we will see progression, positive progression with the medical costs going down over the year. I don't know if we're going to see much of that, frankly, in the second quarter. We've got a brand-new population, we've got to go out and assess that, get folks in care management, et cetera, and it may be just too soon after the enrollment to see much of a decrease.
Joseph Mario Molina: Having -- this is Mario. Having said that, remember we guided to a 90% MLR in Texas.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Right, right. Now -- and that's trying what I'm trying to get a sense for, what sort of the sequential trend will be there, but if you don't have it, you don't have it. I guess the other thing is similar on the G&A side, can you give us a sense for the progression there? And can you remind us what you're targeting for the year?
Joseph Mario Molina: Joe will pull up what we're targeting for the year, I think. In terms of progression, we should see some improvement in the admin, because we had the admin buildup in the first quarter without the revenue associated with it in -- with Texas, but then you're also going to get a little bit of headwinds because if, in fact, our Missouri appeal is not upheld, then we'll lose that revenue in the back half of the year. Joe, you have that, what we talked about?
Joseph W. White: Yes. We've guided to 7.8%, which is pretty much consistent with where we expect to end up now. Remember that in addition to the incremental admin expense related to the Texas startup in the first quarter, we also only had one month of revenue, the incremental revenue in Texas.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Windley with Jefferies.
David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: A couple of small ones, I think. So you mentioned the family of quintuplets. Was that the singular premature birth issue? Or was it broader in Missouri, the comments that you made there?
John C. Molina: That was the majority of the $5 million, not all of it, but that was the majority.
David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: And $5 million was the number. I missed that before. And then in Wisconsin, it looks like the MLR in 1Q ticked back up from what you were seeing the last few quarters prior to this one. Wondered if you could comment on what was going on there and if you expect that to trend back down again.
John C. Molina: Wisconsin is still a relatively small plan, so it's going get hit with some fluctuations, still. If you look at year-over-year, don't look at the MLR for a second. If you look at the medical costs year-over-year, we brought those down $30 PMPM. And one of the of the big challenges we've had in Wisconsin is the rate issue. We've gotten, I think, 2 significant rate cuts in 2 years. So if we can maintain the medical care costs, maybe bring them down a little bit more but really work the battle on the revenue side, I think Wisconsin will right itself.
David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: And maybe one last question. So you've mentioned both of your appeal protests, Ohio and Missouri. Can you comment to us about what your timing expectations are around hearing updates from the states on those 2?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, the court case was heard by the judge in Missouri last week, and we're hoping for a decision somewhere around, perhaps, May 10. So that's probably the next bit of information we'll have out of Missouri. In terms of the appeal in Ohio, perhaps later this week. We don't really know.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Melissa McGinnis with Morgan Stanley.
Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Can you just provide us an update, kind of setting startup markets aside, about what you're seeing from a cost trend perspective, with particular focus on utilization trends, maybe by category? And then more broadly, maybe just remind us what factored into your 2012 outlook for medical cost trends, sort of in your same-store book or the non-startup market?
John C. Molina: Okay. We're talking 10 different health plans. What I would say is the medical costs for our more stable plans appears to be flat. However, that doesn't necessarily translate into lower MCR across the board, because we do have rate pressures, as we talked about, in Ohio, California, with the new Washington contract, I believe there's a slight dip in the Washington revenue. But in places like Michigan, New Mexico, Utah, those are -- our utilization is pretty flat. Even in California for the non-SPD population, the more the legacy or more mature population, the tenant [ph] population, it's been fairly flat. I think that we guided to an overall MCR of 85? 85, Joe?
Joseph W. White: 86 so far.
John C. Molina: 86. And that was sort of a combination of the higher medical costs and -- with the new populations like Texas and the California SPD. And really, we didn't book or didn't anticipate much improvement, even in the more mature plans. But we didn't anticipate much deterioration either.
Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, so no real deterioration in kind of mature MLRs, even though I think you have assumed flat to negative rate increases across the board in every market?
John C. Molina: That's right.
Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Do you assume just that you can offset cost pressures with medical management techniques?
John C. Molina: Well, there are 2 things. One is we are aggressively pursuing medical management opportunities, and the second is while we anticipated no rate increases, we're also not anticipating that the states are going to increase their Medicaid fee schedules. So really, if utilization is flat and there's not increased medical or Medicaid fee schedule increases, overall, I'm sure it should be basically flat.
Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, great. And then I guess switching focus. In the event that you do leave Ohio next year, how fast can we think about you sort of shutting down that health plan to sort of get rid of the SG&A cost there? And is that even really the right way to think about it, because is there some opportunity to maybe redeploy some of the corporate overhead that may be supported by that market towards some of your newer opportunities, such as the California duals?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, this is Mario. There are a couple of things. We do have the RFP -- or RFA for the duals coming up, and if we get that, then much of the staff there is going to be retained for that contract. Also, some of the people in Ohio are working on other state projects, so we do have some regional people there as well. So it's not as if everyone in Ohio is only working on Ohio projects and if that Ohio Medicaid contract goes away that there's no need for them. So there's a little bit of overlap. So there will be -- if we were to not prevail in the appeal and if we were not to get the contract for the duals, then we would have to decrease the staff and decrease the SG&A. But it would be a gradual process. We still have the claims run-out that we're going to have to do, and that'll take a year. So there are going to be SG&A costs associated with that. Now some of that is built into the reserves when we're doing our reserving. We'll wind it down as quickly as we can, but it won't go away completely.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: So just thinking about the dual RFA that came out for Ohio. I noticed that there were some changes to how the state had set it up for the regular TANF CHIP contract and that you were able in the dual RFA to use -- even if you were in the state, you could use an additional state's data for clinical performance or care coordination. And that's different from how it was in that TANF CHIP contracting. So I'm wondering is it reading too much into that difference to see maybe the state learned something from the first experience and improved it in the second? Or is it -- should I just be thinking about it as 2 different sets of people going down 2 different paths with really no correlation between the 2?
Joseph Mario Molina: Sarah, this is Mario. I think that the lesson learned from all this is that each RFA is unique and different. And it's very difficult to translate your experience from one to the next. I think it's difficult to translate the questions from one RFA to the next. They may have been assembled by different people, they may have different goals. You just have to take each one individually.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Got it, okay. And then lastly, on the MMS business. If you guys could just give us an update on where you are as far as the latest certification processes go and, seeing that Maine got full certification in December, if there's been any discussions around maybe upselling services there?
Joseph Mario Molina: Yes. This is Mario, again. I think it's a little early to talk about upsales in Maine. And as far as Idaho goes, the site visit was in December, and the paperwork is back at CMS. We don't anticipate any problems with that certification. We just don't know exactly when it's going to come through. But I wouldn't take this as a bad sign. This is not -- it often takes 6 months before a plan gets certification after the site visit. So this is not unusual. Okay. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us, and we will see you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina.
Joseph Mario Molina: Thank you, Juan José. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining our discussion today. Let me begin by saying that 2011 was an outstanding year for Molina Healthcare. Were it not for the noncash impairment charge that we took for the loss of our contract in Missouri, we would have reported record earnings for both the fourth quarter and for all of 2011. Even with the Missouri charge, our cash flow from operations in 2011 was the best we have ever reported.  I'll talk more about Missouri in a minute, but first I want to discuss what made 2011 such a good year and what that says about our company's future. The list of our accomplishments for 2011 is long: We had record cash flows from operations; we lowered our medical care ratio by 60 basis points and increased our medical margin by nearly $125 million; we secured a major position in the Texas market; we reduced our fourth quarter medical care ratio in Florida by 15% over the fourth quarter of 2010; we grew our Medicare membership by over 25%; we grew our Age, Blind and Disabled membership by over 50%; we achieved federal certification of our Medicaid Management Information System in Maine; and we positioned ourselves to participate in the dual eligible opportunity across many of our states.  Molina has submitted its notice of intent to apply to capitated fiscal alignment demonstration contracts for 2013 for the dual eligibles in the following states: California, Florida, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin, Virginia and Illinois. Currently, 3 of our largest health plans in California, Ohio and Michigan are in states with large initiatives underway to transition the dual eligibles into managed care.  In California, Molina Healthcare has submitted its response to the state's request for solutions to provide comprehensive care to dual eligible beneficiaries in the state. This program will enroll these beneficiaries into health plans beginning in 2013 and continuing through 2015. There are currently 1.2 million beneficiaries with both Medicaid and Medicare in California. 600,000 of them are in the 5 counties Molina serves: San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino, Los Angeles and Sacramento. The state is going to begin the program in these areas, which the state is expected to identify towards the end of March. Currently, Molina Healthcare it strategically positioned to serve this population in California with an already established Special Needs Plan that serves nearly 6,500 duals in the state.  In Ohio, the state plans to release a revised draft proposal this month for its integrated care delivery system to meet the needs of the dual eligibles. A request for applications is expected in April for implementation in January of 2013.  In Michigan, the state began enrolling dual eligible beneficiaries in Medicaid Health Plans in December of last year. Members in Special Needs Plans in Michigan are automatically enrolled for their Medicaid benefits with an opportunity to opt out. In addition, the Michigan Department of Community Health has been working under Dual Eligible Integrated Care Plan with a target submission date to CMS of April and a target implementation of January 2013.  On another front, we are just a few days away from our expansion go live date of March 1 in Texas. As a result, over the next few weeks, doctors and patients across multiple Texas service areas will see significant changes in how healthcare is delivered. Many families and individuals will be selecting a Medicaid Health Plan for the very first time.  As we outlined at our Investor Day, we anticipate that our enrollment in Texas will nearly double as a result of this expansion. We are also well aware that associated with such large expansions are many challenges. Since we were awarded the contract, we have set up extra phone lines and hired additional staff to help with the influx of new members. In addition, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission and the Molina Healthcare staff in Texas have been hard at work to ensure the seamless transition of members and to minimize problems for our network providers.  I had the opportunity to visit the providers in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas last week, and I came away very impressed with their commitment to the Medicaid population and their proactive approach in dealing with the upcoming change.  In Washington, we successfully defended our position against stiff competition. We have learned that Molina was tentatively awarded all existing service areas in 34 counties, while adding one additional county. The Washington contract will become effective July 2012 and provides managed care services for more than 700,000 Medicaid and basic health beneficiaries while adding 100,000 Age, Blind and Disabled beneficiaries.  In the fiscal agent business, Molina Medicaid Solutions was awarded full federal certification in Maine by the centers for Medicare and Medicaid services. This certification allows the state to receive maximum federal funding for the system. The state of Maine can now claim 75% federal reimbursement for ongoing operations retroactive to September 1, 2010. Since September 1, 2010, the system in Maine has been processing approximately 1 million claims per month and paying nearly 3,000 providers each week.  As a result of not being awarded a new contract in Missouri, our existing contract with the state will expire without renewal on June 30, 2012. Although we were very disappointed to learn about this outcome, Molina Healthcare remains committed to serving the state of Missouri, our providers and, most importantly, our members by approaching our work with a business-as-usual mindset to meet all of our obligations.  At this stage, we are evaluating our options in the state. We regard this outcome as a short-term issue and a trajectory of recently successful RFP results that include the Washington State Medicaid reprocurement, the Texas CHIP world service area RFP and RFPs for the STAR and STAR+PLUS programs in our existing service areas in Texas, as well as RFPs for the El Paso and Rio Grande service areas. We expect to emerge from this recent challenge stronger and even better prepared to take full advantage of the opportunities our growing field offers.  The anticipated growth in our industry resulting from current and new opportunities confirms that we are in the right place at the right time. As we expand our presence in new and existing programs and markets, it's only natural to expect that we will draw increasing competition. The increase in competition validates our long-term strategic imperative: emphasizing diversification, so that the company is not overly reliant on any one specific contract. Diversification has been a consistent theme for Molina Healthcare that we expect will continue to contribute to our sustained success.  We're excited for 2012 and the long-term future for the company. Finally, I'm pleased to announce that Garrey Carruthers, a former governor of New Mexico, was elected to serve as a Director. Governor Carruthers will fill an existing class I Director vacancy and joins Molina Healthcare following a distinguished career in public service in government, higher education and healthcare. Currently Governor Carruthers serves as the Dean of the College of Business of New Mexico State University. We welcome Governor Carruthers and look forward to his contributions.  And now, I'd like to turn the call over to John.
John C. Molina: Thank you, Mario, and hello, everyone. As Mario pointed out, this was a very good quarter and a very good year for the company. While we reported a loss of $0.72 for the quarter and earnings of only $0.45 for the full year, those results were severely impacted by the Missouri impairment charge. Were it not for the noncash impairment charge we took from Missouri, we would have reported diluted earnings per share of $0.62 for the quarter and $1.79 for the year. Please note that the Q4 2011 noncash impairment charge does not impact the company's future cash flows, profitability, liquidity or compliance with debt covenants in our credit facility.  We also had some other items that impacted our fourth quarter results. Our New Mexico health plan entered into a contract amendment that more closely aligned the calculation of revenue within methodology adopted under the Affordable Care Act. The contract amendment changed the calculation of the amount of revenue that we may recognize relative to medical costs. This change added about $0.21 to EPS for the fourth quarter. About $0.07 of that amount related to 2010, while the remaining $0.14 related to 2011. We agreed to settle an arbitration matter in Florida during the fourth quarter and also incurred some costs related to provider contract terminations.  All in, these items reduced fourth quarter earnings per diluted share by about $0.10. Because we have a lot of unusual puts and takes in the quarter, we have added a table at the front of our earnings release to summarize items that you may wish to remove from our reported results to better understand our ongoing operations.  In summary, the impairment charge reduced our EPS for the year and quarter by $1.34. The arbitration and provider termination costs reduced EPS for the year and the quarter by $0.10, and the New Mexico contract amendment increased EPS for the quarter by $0.21. Regarding New Mexico, I want to emphasize that most of the $0.21 benefit relates to the first 3 quarters of 2011. Only $0.07 of that $0.21 benefit relates to 2010.  To reiterate, our fourth quarter represented a strong conclusion to a strong year. Absent all of the items I discussed, our earnings per diluted share would have been $0.51 for the quarter and $1.82 for the year. Annual premium revenues grew by 15% over 2010 to $4.6 billion and fourth quarter premium revenues grew 20% over the fourth quarter of 2010 to $1.3 billion. The revenue increase is primarily due to our increased enrollment among our Age, Blind and Disabled population as well as Medicare population, which have higher premiums and resulted in a higher premium revenue per member per month. Premium rate increases remain anemic, and we expect them to be flat to down throughout the year.  Yesterday, the Supreme Court sent the California Medicaid reimbursement case back to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. As you may recall, the 9th Circuit Court had blocked the Medicaid reductions from taking effect. This action is likely to postpone any immediate resolution and further complicates the state's budget battle. We continue to reserve as if the rate cut will take effect. Please refer back to our January Investor Day presentation, where we detailed our expectations for state-by-state premium changes.  At the end of the year, our enrollments stood at 1.7 million members. Enrollment was up across the majority of our health plans on a sequential basis, with the bulk of the enrollment gains coming from Texas, where the company began serving ABD members in the first quarter, and in California, where the company began serving new ABD members in the third quarter.  Our Medicare enrollment continues to grow steadily and topped 31,000 members for the year. As a reminder, nearly 80% of our Medicare enrollment is in our dual eligible Special Needs Plan.  For all of 2011, we reduced our medical care ratio to 83.9% compared to 84.5% in 2010. Our medical margin increased by 20% or almost $125 million year-over-year.  The flu had little impact on our fourth quarter results, and it is still too early to comment on the flu impact during the first quarter of 2012. The performance of Molina Medicaid Solutions improved between the third and fourth quarters of 2011, with operating income increasing by over $6 million.  General and administrative expenses grew to 9.6% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with 9.3% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010. This increase is due to the settlement of an acquisition-related arbitration matter at our Florida health plan, higher variable compensation and employee health care costs and investment and administrative and infrastructure in anticipation of the opportunities in Texas and among our dual eligible population.  EBITDA for the first -- for the full year of 2011 was $155 million, including the $65 million noncash impairment charge, which is a decrease of 7% compared to $166 million in 2010. So without the impairment charge, EBITDA would have been approximately $219 million for the full fiscal year.  Operating cash flow for 2011 increased by $64 million to $225 million compared with $161 million for the same period of 2010. As of December 31, 2011, the company had cash and investments of approximately $893 million. The parent company had free cash and investments of approximately $24 million. Days and claims payable in the fourth quarter were 40 days, which was up 1 day on a sequential basis. The company is revising its 2011 -- 2012 EPS guidance discussed at our Investor Day on January 26, 2012, from $1.80 EPS to $1.75 EPS. The primary factor influencing this change was the loss of the Missouri contract, which is now set to expire without renewal on June 30, 2012. A complete discussion of our assumptions and risk factors associated with our guidance can be found in our Investor Day presentation available at our website.  This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Carl McDonald with Citigroup.
Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I wanted to focus first on Texas, and just wanted to see the trajectory as you look into 2012, so sort of starting from the, call it 93% loss ratios on 2011, you're guiding for something closer to 90% in 2012. So what gets you comfortable that the base business is going to get better in 2012 relative to all the new membership coming on that presumably will be at a higher loss ratio than 90%?
John C. Molina: Carl, it's John. There are a number of moving pieces in Texas, but we were able to make what we believe are some improvements in the fourth quarter, largely because some of the care requirements -- the sum of [ph] care requirements that began to move away on the population that came in, in the Jefferson Service Area. The mix that's shifting a little bit for -- a little bit more towards the STAR membership. We also don't have the same profit sharing that we had in 2011. And we think that we have done a pretty good job of making sure that we're staffed up and prepared for the influx of membership. Now having said all of that, we are expecting that across the entirety of the state, the medical care ratio will be 90% for the entire year. We're also adding pharmacy and inpatient responsibility, and we generally tend to do pretty well on the pharmacy piece. So while 90% is nothing to write home about, we think that we have put some mechanisms in place to help with the utilization, and we've done some nice work on recontracting some of the challenging hospital contracts. Long answer, but that's what we said in January, and we're sticking to it.
Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then separate question. What was the accrual in California for the retroactive rate cut relative to the, I believe, it was $7.5 million in the third quarter?
John C. Molina: Joe, you got that?
Joseph W. White: Yes. Carl, it's Joe. The $7.5 million, basically, we found out, I think, in November that, that increase we'd expect to have netted down to maybe 6%. It's really 3.5%. So essentially there was no incremental accrual in the fourth quarter. And in effect, what we had accrued at the end of the third quarter was adequate to take us through the year.
John C. Molina: And Carl, let me just add, despite the recent court decision, we are still accruing as though the rate is going to be decreased.
Joseph W. White: You may recall, Carl, at Investor Day we talked about a roughly 3.5% rate cut [indiscernible] in December 1, 2011. So that's what we're talking about there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Charles Boorady with Crédit Suisse.
Charles Andrew Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I just wanted to follow up on the California question for a second, because in the last Q, and I think what we talked about last was that the 10% rate cut, if it were to take effect, would have a 6% negative impact on your revenues. Are you now saying that, that same 10% cut would have only a 3%, 3.5% negative impact on your revenue? Or am I misunderstanding what you just said?
John C. Molina: Charles, the error that we made previously was we applied that 10% to all provider categories, and it turns out that the states did not apply it to all provider types and all provider services. So we had overestimated the impacts previously. We think we've got it estimated correctly now, and I think it's about a 3.5% hit.
Charles Andrew Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got it. To revenue, or -- okay, and the 3.5% revenue hit, when you consider everything that gets passed through versus what hit year bottom line, you're saying is about a $7.5 million now for 6 months rather than $7.5 million for a quarter?
Joseph W. White: Yes, $7.5 million for 6 months, that's correct.
Charles Andrew Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, got it. And then do you have any sense for -- I've read a lot about the Supreme Court decision, and it sounds like both sides are claiming victory. I mean, what's your read on the upshot of the Supreme Court decision today? Does it make more likely or less likely that a 10% cut will ultimately happen?
Joseph Mario Molina: Charles, it's Mario. I really don't know. I mean, we're just going to have to see how this plays out. I think that one of the things the court said was that circumstances have changed, and that's one of the reasons they sent it back. So it's not a victory for the state or for the providers. They want further discussion, and we'll just have to see how it plays out.
Charles Andrew Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got it. Okay, and then just finally on Missouri, in light of your exit there, what's the amount of excess reserves that you have that you think might come back into earnings once you're fully out of that state?
John C. Molina: Charles, we don't have that much in terms of excess reserves that are material. We always keep an adequate amount for adverse deviation in terms of what we reserve, but we also have excess statutory capital. And if you're talking about the excess debt cap, it's probably $25 million or $30 million, which we can -- we'll be able to deploy for other things.
Joseph W. White: That's not a P&L impact, though.
Charles Andrew Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: So they will -- okay, so there will be no P&L impact from any excess statutory capital.
Joseph W. White: Correct. So Charles, let me express it this way. We do not ever intentionally carry excess reserves in our liability. So the reserve that we recorded at 12/31 is our best estimate of that reserve.
Charles Andrew Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got it. You said that once you're out of there, if you discover that there was excess, does that just come back into the P&L in the form of earnings or...
Joseph W. White: Yes.
Charles Andrew Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And at this point, you don't think that's going to be material, is that what you're implying?
Joseph W. White: That's correct, it will not be material.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.
Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: First question, maybe just sticking on Missouri. Maybe if you could just talk about what you thought the key reasons were on why you weren't awarded another contract there.
Joseph Mario Molina: Scott, this is Mario. We haven't had a chance yet to examine the scoring, and so it would be premature for us to comment on that.
Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. Then just a separate question on just the provider termination costs that you cited in the 4Q report. Maybe if you could just elaborate a bit on that in terms of which markets did those provider terms relate to and how many providers were actually terminated from the network?
Joseph W. White: This is Joe speaking. It's 2 or 3 providers spread across 2 or 3 states for a total impact of maybe $2 million, $2.5 million.
Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just a question, just on the RFS out in California and the Legislative Analyst's Office recently put out a report and supporting moving forward with the pilot but sort of cautioning against moving too quickly on the state-wide expansion. And just sort of interested in sort of how much pull does that outfit have in terms of influencing the legislature and in sort of the way things stand in terms of timing of a pilot versus a broader state-wide expansion?
Joseph Mario Molina: This is Mario. We disagree with the Legislative Analyst's report for 3 reasons. First, many states across the country are going forward with similar programs, and there's been a lot of research done on this, so I don't think that a pilot is necessary. Second, this is really a federal initiative. The federal government wants to move the dual eligible beneficiaries into managed care programs that combine the funding for both to provide better coordinated care. And finally, I think it's unfair to the beneficiaries themselves to withhold coordinated care programs that can better serve their needs and make sure that they're getting the benefits that they're entitled to. So for all those reasons, we disagree with the Legislative Analyst's Office, and we side with the Governor on this.
John C. Molina: And I would just add one other thing, and that is we just talked about the difficulty California has had in cutting the provider rates. Their budget's not getting any better, and this will save money.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays Capital.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just -- first question, I just want to make sure I understood the New Mexico change in revenues. What exactly does that mean that you've changed the recognition to be more in line with PPACA as it relates to cost? I guess I'm just not sure exactly what you were looking at there.
Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking. To distill a lot of detail, essentially, the contract amendment modifies the definition of revenue, in effect, modifies the denominator and the calculation of medical costs over revenue. It also changed the minimum percentage to 85% over the life of the contract. So it -- those 2, the change in definition of revenue and the assignment of an 85% minimum over the life of contract, triggered the accounting recognitions.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So Joe, were you accruing contra revenue that no longer gets accrued? Is that why the revenues went out?
Joseph W. White: That is correct, that is correct.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, okay. Got you, makes sense now. And then, I guess, as it relates to California and their request for solutions, what -- I think it's due this week. What sort of recommendations are you providing the state? What do you think would be most helpful for California if they manage the duals?
Terry P. Bayer: Josh, it's Terry. I think as we've shared with you, we have a care model that we believe, if we can bring in and have a single funding stream and be given the opportunity to coordinate all aspects of care, including the long-term support services, the long-term care residents, et cetera, that we will be able to improve the quality of the outcomes, coordinate all of the services, reduce the fragmentation and ultimately, bring about reduced cost and a better outcome. And simply, we've been doing this now for a number of years in our Special Needs Plan where we're serving the duals except for that last piece, which is covered by Medicaid in terms of long-term care. So we've got the experience with the Special Needs Plans, and we're going to build on that and pick up this long-term services portion, which includes a lot of social and nonmedical needs being met for these patients. So we submitted the care model, and we're looking forward to implementing it in all of our markets if the state so desires.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And I'm sorry just one last one, if I could sneak it in. Just the transition from capitation of fee-for-service in Michigan and Washington, the cost ticked up there because you're moving, I guess, from cap to fee-for-service. Is that intentional or what -- and if so, why would you want to do that?
Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking. And this is the transition that happened in Washington effective 12/31/2010 and then in Michigan during the course of the year. Our general feeling is that we favor arrangements that are more fee-for-service based because it helps in encouraging providers to send in their account or [ph] data. We collect that information as we pay claims, which is helpful from a patient care perspective and a rate setting perspective with the state. I'd say for -- in most circumstances, those agreements, that change was voluntary. I can't speak to the physicians on the other end, but again, we favor -- well, we do capitate the arrangements and we're okay with it when necessary. We do like the greater visibility into patient care than a fee-for-service arrangement can give us.
Joseph Mario Molina: This is Mario. I also think that it's ironic, given all the discussion in Washington about accountable care organizations, we increasingly see the providers moving away from capitation and back towards fee-for-service payments.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: You like it more -- you're saying just because of the claims visibility, you're actually getting the claims. It doesn't sound like it's necessarily financially more or less attractive one way or the other?
Joseph Mario Molina: That's correct.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ken Lavine with UBS.
Kenneth Lavine - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Just had a question on your Washington state business, now that it looks like you have some enhanced clarity compared to the January Investor Day on how the membership may shake out there. Just want to get your updated thoughts on what the MLR should look like here in 2012. I think your Investor Day, it showed something like an 80%, 86% target for '12, which is a pretty sharp ramp versus 2011 and particularly one where you exited 2011 from. So just kind of looking for a little better clarity with what the moving parts are there? And then this 86%...
John C. Molina: The thing that's driving that is primarily the addition of the ABD members, which we would anticipate would come in at a higher MCR out the gate just because you've got pent-up demand. So we also think that there may be some shift in mix as folks who aren't heavy utilizers on the TANF side may switch plans or may not re-enroll. And then you got pressure on the premiums. Washington does have a pretty significant budget deficit still. And there's pressure on the rates.
Kenneth Lavine - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And I guess the post-RFP, post the new contract, that's a second half event and normally would really impact the third and fourth quarters. So with the MLRs for that -- for those quarters be maybe closer to 90% in Washington?
Joseph Mario Molina: I think -- this is Joe speaking. I think they will certainly be higher, I know that will go as high as 90%. But we don't give quarterly guidance, but I think it's fair to say we've modeled higher MCRs in the second half of the year for Washington, yes.
Kenneth Lavine - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And how should we think about any sort of diminished SG&A leverage if any, as a result of kind of some of the foregone membership here in Washington? I think you had talked at one of your Investor Days a few years ago about the incremental earnings accretion from Ohio, from some membership that you picked up from a planned exit, from a competitor exit. And I think you have cited something like 2% incremental administrative expense. Is that in the ballpark for, I guess, kind of the reversed sort of leverage here?
John C. Molina: I think you're going to see sort of a trade-out, Ken. As we move from a primarily TANF population, we're going to lose some membership. We'll pick it up as we get the ABD, but they have higher needs both on the medical but also the administrative. So we're not looking at decreases in staff, even though the absolute number of patients is going to go down. So I think it sort of gets washed out.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sarah James with Wedbush.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the California dual opportunity. I'm seeing that there is such a variance in the proposals. I was wondering if you could give us some insight on who you think will ultimately be making that decision, if it's going to be collaborative or coming from one part of the state government versus another? And then what the timing is that you're looking for the final word on how the rollout will happen?
Joseph Mario Molina: This is Mario. In terms of when we will get the final word out, I would imagine it will come with the state budget when that gets resolved. In terms of who's going to drive this, I think a lot is going to be driven by the governor, and I think that there are -- there is support and a legislature as well for this expansion. I think that people are increasingly realizing that coordinated care is much better for this dual eligible population than the current fragmented fee-for-service system. And we're seeing it not just in California, not just in Sacramento, but we're seeing that in the statehouses across the country. This is a growing trend, and we expect it to continue, and perhaps, even accelerate over 2013.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay. And on some of the cost comments that were made in the press release, one of them mentioned utilization down 2%. So I was just wondering if you could comment if that's across all markets or any geography in particular, and if there's any change in the trend for birthrates or flu cost?
Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking. What we've seen in the utilization has been pretty generalized. It has been, I'd say, very generalized. Births. First, we continue to show a drop in birth income, which would suggest some drop in birthrates. And flu, I don't think we have enough information to talk anything about. We don't see a whole lot of it as normal [ph].
Operator: Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we have time for only one more question. Our last question comes from Melissa McGinnis with Morgan Stanley.
Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I guess sticking with the California duals. If in the event that the state sort of puts the 10 county expansion on hold, and we only get the 4 county expansion via the RFS, what's your understanding of how the state is maybe deciding which 4 counties are the best places to pilot this program?
Joseph Mario Molina: That's a really good question. This is Mario. It's hard to know. I think it's going to depend a lot on the responses they get to the RFS. They have encouraged the local initiatives and the commercial plans to cooperate, and we have certainly done that in the Inland Empire and in San Diego and in concert with L.A. Care and HealthNet in Los Angeles County. And Los Angeles County is the largest county, so you might look for it to start there. But one of the other large regions in California is the Inland Empire. So I think those things are going to drive this. The other thing to think about is do they want to diversify the model? Do they want to do a 2 plan model and, for example, maybe a geographic managed care model like San Diego County. We just going to have to wait and see.
Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, great. And then as all of us think through the revenue opportunity and ultimately, the earnings opportunity, given your experience with Medicare offerings and the margins we can usually see on the Medicare side of the business and your experience in California and then maybe thinking through the incremental G&A benefit you get from end-market expansions, what do you think incremental margins on a dual contract can really look like for a health plan? Are we thinking more like Medicaid margins? Maybe a blend of -- I mean, Medicaid margins? More a blend of Medicare and Medicaid? How are you thinking about that?
John C. Molina: I think initially -- this is John. At least for the first year, it's probably going to be much closer to a Medicaid-type margin. And the reason I say that is, the big additional piece, as Terry points out, are the Personal Care Services, the Personal Attendant Services, which really aren't even medical in nature but they are an important and expensive piece of the care continuum. And most of the states are going to try and have very long runways for continuity of care. So at least initially, there is going to be not a lot we are going to be able to influence on that piece, but it will come over time as we are able to keep those patients out of the nursing homes and out of the hospital. But I would not suspect that we're going to get Medicare-type of margins initially.
Operator: Dr. Molina, I'll turn the call back to you.
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, I just want to say thank you to all the employees. We saw marked improvements in operations, both on the health plan side and on the Molina Medicaid Solutions part of the business this year. And it was an outstanding year, blemished unfortunately by the Missouri contract loss, which we had to take in 2011, even though the contract loss won't actually take place until 2012. So my thanks to all my fellow employees, and we will see you at the next earnings call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Molina Healthcare Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday October 25, 2011. I would now like to turn the conference over to Juan José Orellana, Vice President of Investor Relations with Molina Healthcare. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan José Orellana: Thank you, Allan. Hello everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare's financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2011. The company's earnings release reporting its results was issued today after the market closed and is now posted for viewing on our company website. On the call with me today are Dr. Mario Molina, our CEO; John Molina, our CFO; Terry Bayer, our COO; and Joseph White, our Chief Accounting Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. If you happen to have multiple questions, we ask that you get back in the queue so that others can have an opportunity to ask their questions as well. Our comments today will contain forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, including statements regarding our earnings per share guidance for 2011, expected rate changes and opportunities relating to the migration of dual eligibles into managed care. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K annual report for fiscal year 2010, our Form 10-Q quarterly reports and our Form 8-K current reports. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab at our company website or on the SEC's website. All forward-looking statements made during today's call represent our judgment as of October 25, 2011, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements. This call is being recorded and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available over the Internet through the company's website at molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina.
Joseph Mario Molina: Thank you, Juan José. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining our discussion of third quarter 2011 financial results. Let me begin by saying that I'm very pleased with the performance of our business, both in financial terms as well as our strategic execution. Our team's efforts resulted in a quarter that reached the highest levels of both revenue and net income that we've ever had.  For the third quarter of 2011, we earned $19 million in net income or $0.41 per diluted share despite operating in the most complicated premium rate environment in the history of our company. For fiscal year 2011, 6 out of 10 of our states actually cut their premium rates. Nevertheless, today's financial results were consistent with our expected quarterly performance towards achieving the full year guidance of $1.55 per diluted share.  Our comments today will be brief since there was considerable discussion about our business as well as the key drivers of our financial performance at the company's Investor Day held on September 15. During that presentation, we discussed various business drivers, including the premium rate environment in our industry and specifically in our markets, the performance of our legacy health plans versus our newer startup health plans, and utilization trends. Although there have been no fundamental changes to these drivers, there are a few updates that we want to share with you. Let me begin with the rates. Our forecast at the beginning of the year that premium rates in 2011 would be flat to down has borne out as we now have full rate visibility and we believe our industry will continue to operate in a state of flat to down rates for the near future. State budgets have yet to recover, and the expiration of the enhanced federal matching funds have exerted pressure on state premium rates. You may recall that at our Investor Day, we did not have premium rate information on Florida, Michigan and Washington, all of which became effective in either September or October of this year. We now have those rates. In Washington, rates were reduced by approximately 1% effective October 1. This rate decrease is consistent with our projections that rates will be flat to down. However, in a bit of positive news regarding rates, Florida and Michigan benefited from blended rate increases of approximately 7.5% and 1%, respectively. In Florida, where the rate increase was effective September 1, the increase is particularly helpful to Medicaid reform counties like Broward, where medical cost trend has outpaced premium rates for quite some time. Blended rates in Broward County increased by nearly 10%. In Michigan, the 1% rate increase, which became effective on October 1, was consistent with our previous expectations. Given the effective date of the new premium rates for Florida, Michigan and Washington, the revenue impact will be fully reflected in the fourth quarter of 2011 and will continue into 2012. Although rates have been a challenge, our business remains strong, and we are reaffirming our guidance of $1.55 per diluted share for 2011.  Our established or legacy health plans continue to perform well and our consolidated medical costs have been stable. Excluding Texas, which has experienced high utilization and a considerable influx of new members, fee-for-service costs remained flat. Hospital utilization was flat when compared to the second quarter and declined approximately 7% year-over-year.  Our newer markets are improving financially. For example, the medical costs of the Florida plan on a per member, per month basis have decreased both sequentially and year-over-year, primarily due to initiatives implemented to reduce pharmacy costs and a new behavioral health contract. The 7.5% premium increase that became effective on September 1 will help improve profitability in this state. While managing medical costs is essential to our business, we remain equally focused on quality. We were very pleased earlier this month when Molina Healthcare of Missouri earned an accreditation from the National Committee on Quality Assurance. This brings the number of NCQA-accredited Molina Medicaid health plans to 9. We're especially proud that our focus on quality has attracted national attention and recognition from Consumer Reports, which ranks the top Medicaid health plans in the country. Finally, Molina Medicaid Solutions currently shares many similarities with our health plan business as it relates to contract maturity. Like the Health Plan business, our legacy or established fiscal agent contracts are stable and contributing to earnings, while the newer start-up states like Maine and Idaho have resulted in short-term losses. However, we believe that once we get through the certification process, the performance of Idaho and Maine will improve. Maine has already completed its certification audit visit from CMS and we should find out the result by the end of the year. A substantial milestone was achieved in Idaho when we received notice from the state of Idaho that our system was out of the pilot phase. This milestone triggered payments of approximately $10 million, which were received during the quarter. We anticipate the CMS certification audit visit for Idaho to occur in early December. As a reminder, given the accounting intricacies of the fiscal agent business, we are not recognizing revenue and expense in Idaho yet, but the payment does have a cash flow impact.  As you can see, during the first few quarters of 2011, we have executed our strategy in a way that has improved our performance for the year, while providing an even more solid foundation for the future. We believe our 31-year history in this business and our capacity for adaptation to economic cycles makes us exceptionally well suited for this task. It positions us to succeed even in today's challenging economic environment. Near-term economic and industry factors are also incubating new opportunities for our company in the areas of direct delivery and care coordination for the dual eligible population. We've long talked about our direct delivery capabilities as a vehicle for enhancing access in underserved communities. This year, our direct delivery presence has increased with the opening of 4 new clinics in California and 1 in Washington. Additional clinics are also in the pipeline in Florida and New Mexico.  Another key and transformational opportunity remains the transition of the dual eligible population into Managed Care. I spoke about this topic in more detail at our Investor Day on September 15, so please feel free to refer back to those materials. Currently, there are nearly 9 million beneficiaries that qualify for both Medicaid and Medicare. This population is the sickest of the sick with multiple chronic conditions and behavioral health issues that account for nearly $300 billion annually in total spending. 3/4 of this population live at 125% or below the federal poverty level, and many face the same challenges that plague the low-income populations currently served by our health plans. This is a population that is a natural extension of our service offering and that we believe will benefit the most from Managed Care. We are strategically positioned to serve this population through our dual eligible Medicare Special Needs plan, which is currently ranked as the eighth largest special needs plan in the country, and through our presence in 3 states with the largest dual eligible populations: California, Florida and Texas.  There's already work underway and CMS awarded 15 states planning grants for migrating dual eligibles into Managed Care. 3 of those 15 states are also where Molina has its largest health plans. This is a huge opportunity, larger than many of the Medicaid RFPs currently in the pipeline, and we look forward to expanding our presence in assisting this vulnerable population.  Our company began with a mission to bring quality care to those who need it most but can least afford it. In addition to our growth over the years, we remain committed to this mission. It is at the core of what makes Molina Healthcare different. We are a mission-driven culture. We have the physician-focused leadership legacy of our founder, my father, Doctor C. David Molina, and we have 31 years of experience in this industry. We have a flexible delivery model that includes health plans, fiscal agents and direct delivery. There is no other healthcare organization that can say that. Our results show that we're taking the right approach to this environment and that the underlying fundamentals of our business continue to support our aspirations for the future. In the near term, that means leveraging the performance of our established health plans while working to improve the performance in newer markets. I will now turn the call over to John, who will review our financial results in greater detail.
John C. Molina: Thank you, Mario. Hello, everybody. We are pleased with our results today. EPS for the quarter was $0.41, up 8% from a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $19 million, up 17% over last year, and EBITDA increased by nearly 10% over the same period one year ago. As Mario mentioned, these are the highest levels we've ever achieved for these financial metrics. At the end of the quarter, our enrollment stood at 1.7 million members. Enrollment was up across the majority of our health plans on a sequential basis. The bulk of the enrollment gains were in Texas, where the company began serving new TANF and ABD members in the Jefferson County service area effective September 1 of this year.  Our Medicare enrollment continued to grow steadily and topped 28,000 members during the quarter. Our year-to-date Medicare revenue grew to $282 million, nearly 50% higher than it was one year ago. As a reminder, nearly 80% of our Medicare enrollment is comprised of dual eligibles. Consolidated premium revenues grew 13% to $1.2 billion in the third quarter of 2011 compared to the same period last year due to an 8% increase in membership and a 5% increase in PMPM revenue due to mix shift.  Mario has already spent some time discussing the rates in his remarks and there's no question of the impact that flat to down rates have had on our business. There are also other revenue adjustments we made in the quarter that, while not necessarily one-time in nature, nevertheless can serve to obscure the underlying strong performance we are observing across our health plans. For example, reductions to revenue due to a minimum medical care floor in New Mexico and a private cap in Texas had a negative $5.9 million impact in the third quarter of 2011 compared to a benefit of $2.9 million in the third quarter of 2010. This is an $8.8 million swing in results. In California, the medical care ratio jumped to nearly 89%. As we discussed at our Investor Day, the California plan accrued for the 10% provider rate reduction that the state of California announced in July. If approved by CMS, the provider rate cut and our capitation rate will be retroactive to July 1, 2011. In consideration of these intentions, we made an accrual that resulted in a $7.5 million reduction to revenue during the third quarter without any offset to medical costs. Absent these adjustments, which negatively impacted our financials for the quarter, our results would have been better than the strong performance we recorded today. In light of this challenging revenue environment, it is essential that we aggressively manage our costs. Excluding the Texas health plan, which has seen an increase in costs that we have previously detailed, fee-for-service costs were flat on a PMPM basis. Fee-for-service and capitation costs combined increased approximately 4%. Of note is that hospital utilization decreased approximately 7% year-over-year. General and administrative expenses for the quarter remained flat at 8.5% of revenue, despite the need to invest in preparation for healthcare reform, ICD-10 implementation, and the implementation of a new Enterprise Resource Planning system brought on to help with our growth. You may also recall that at our Investor Day, we announced the rightsizing of our credit facility. As a result of this change, we wrote off approximately $1.1 million in capitalized issuance costs. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $155 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2011, compared with $9.5 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2010. The company had cash and investments of $881 million, and the parent company had cash and investments of $54 million. Days in claims payable remained flat sequentially. Our board has authorized a share buyback program of up to $75 million. This is in addition to the $7 million program announced in July of 2011. Finally, we are reaffirming our EPS guidance of $1.55 for the year ended December 31, 2011. This concludes our prepared remarks. As a reminder, if you have multiple questions, we ask that you get back in the queue so that we have time for everyone to have an opportunity to ask questions. Allan, we're now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays Capital.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just a question on the Texas -- I guess I'm just a little confused on Texas rebate versus the Texas MLR issue, so is it just because the new members are coming in and that doesn't count as sort of a statewide profit? Is it just -- is just CHIP the only thing that counts or is that profit cap? I'm just sort of confused as to why the MLR was a lot higher and yet you're still accruing some of these negative revenue accruals because of the rebates you needed there?
John C. Molina: Josh, this is John. The profit cap is based on the product line, and so CHIP's got one. Actually they all have one, but in CHIP our MCR is low enough that we've got to do a rebate, but the other lines of business, it's high.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. You don't get to sort of offset any of that within the state?
John C. Molina: No, you don't.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And then -- sorry, just one more quick correction or question. You put in the press release, you talked about a potential for provider payment recoupment in California, and I was just curious what the potential size was or how that would go about, or how that would come about, I should say?
John C. Molina: Well, if the fee schedule goes into effect as the state of California has planned, that would reduce the medical fee schedule by 10%. To the extent that we had providers that we paid at the higher rate going back to July 1, we would have the ability to go back and recoup the difference between what we pay them and the new fee schedule.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And is there a way to size what that is?
John C. Molina: We have not done that yet.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And I know they've done retro cuts before. Have you been successful in going back to providers and saying, "We overpaid CHIP [ph]. Here's the new fee schedule"?
John C. Molina: The answer to that is somewhere between 0% of the time and 100% of the time.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Another clarifying question on the California issue, is the 6% assumed reduction only -- will that only occur if the 10% fee schedule reduction occurs? Does one have to happen for the other to occur, I guess is what I'm trying to ask?
John C. Molina: Yes.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. Can you give us a sense for -- I know there's been some ongoing legal issues there, court hearings. Where does that process stand at this point?
John C. Molina: There are 2 separate processes going on. A prior rate change from several years ago has been contested and worked its way through the courts, and I believe it was heard by the Supreme Court this past month. That relates to who has standing to sue regarding the rates. The current rate year has a proposed 10% rate cut in place and that has been submitted to CMS for approval. The 2 are not at this point connected.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.
Sam Wass - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: This is Sam Wass on for Matt. I know that you mentioned that hospital utilization is down 7%. I was wondering if it'd be possible to go into any more specifics on that, whether you saw variation across different markets?
Joseph Mario Molina: Sam, this is Mario. No, we're not going to break it out by market. Suffice it to say, we saw a 7% decrease year-to-date as compared to last year, and that from the second to the third quarter, hospital utilization was flat.
Sam Wass - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got you. And is there anything worth noting on physician or outpatient?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, I think we talked about what the changes were for pharmacy, physician and outpatient, so I don't think there's anything more remarkable beyond what we described in the release.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Charles Boorady with Crédit Suisse.
Charles Andrew Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: First question, just a small nit here on the deficiency reserve release. Can you size that up for us? Was it roughly in the $0.02 to $0.04 range?
Joseph W. White: It's about -- it's Joe speaking, Charles. It's 1.8 million, so a hair over $0.02.
Charles Andrew Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, great. And then in terms of your guidance for the year, what are you assuming for fourth quarter influenza?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, Charles, we don't break it out that way. What we have said and maintain is that we are looking at $1.55 for the year.
Charles Andrew Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Basically we assume that you bake in a typical flu season for the year, which hasn't really been picking up. It's kind of early in the season, but as we look at one of your guidance [ph]...
Joseph Mario Molina: It is early, but we always take that into consideration when we develop our numbers for the year.
Charles Andrew Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got it. As we look out to the new expansions in 2012, there's some expansions in existing markets and in some new markets. How should we think about the marginal admin cost that comes with some of the new contract wins?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, I think we talked a lot about that at the Investor Day back on September 15, so I would refer you back to our discussions of the new and expanded markets that we talked about, especially in Texas. There will be some additional incremental admin costs, but since we're already operating in Texas, for example, it's not going to be large.
Charles Andrew Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, great. Yes, those were helpful slides. just a wide range of possibilities for 2012 still. And I guess, getting some more granularity on that, when do you think you'd have a reasonable range down at the EPS level of where you think putting those components together we'd get to next year?
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, we're not prepared to talk about 2012 guidance at this time, so it would probably have to wait until after the first of the year.
Charles Andrew Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: So after Jan. 1. All right, great. Just finally, as you look at the various components of medical trend, and I know you gave us some of those components on the call today, after the quarter ended just in the last, say, month, or as you look towards the end of the last quarter, you reported -- do you start to see any inflection points at all in any of those components where costs are either continuing to decrease surprisingly or starting to bend upward?
John C. Molina: It's too early to make any definitive statements, Charles.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of David Windley with Jefferies.
David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: So I was looking at the 4 states in which you had rate changes that were either not effective until after the quarter or effective for only part of the quarter, and I wondered if it was possible or if you looked at what your MCR would have been had those rates been effective for the full third quarter and what would the net effect those had been?
John C. Molina: You know what, we didn't do that analysis. I'm not really sure how meaningful it would have been.
David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. If I could ask one other then.
John C. Molina: Sure.
David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: In Texas, on the comments around higher utilization, is that exclusively related to the new ABD members, or is that a statement that reflects more of a broader base of membership that's driving utilization?
Terry P. Bayer: This is Terry Bayer. It's reflective of the new membership and it ties back to what we've shared with you when we go into a new market, we run it at a higher cost until we're able to institute all of our programs. So that applies in this case to the new membership in the Dallas/Fort Worth service area this year.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Tom Caroll with Stifel.
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: A clarification on the California revenue adjustment of $7.5 million, is that just for third quarter, or is that an amount that you expect to cover the entire second half of this year?
John C. Molina: No, Tom. Joe can answer that.
Joseph W. White: Yes, Tom, it's Joe. That is just the estimated third quarter impact so about $2.5 million a month.
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. So is -- I mean, if things don't get finalized, could we see a paragraph like this on your fourth quarter call or do you expect to have things wrapped up by then?
Joseph Mario Molina: It's certainly possible, Tom. It all depends on what happens with CMS in the state, but this is our best estimate based on what they've told us and what the revenue is going to look like.
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Got it, got it.
Joseph Mario Molina: If we... will go with the final rates. If we don't, you will see another paragraph next quarter.
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And on your repurchase that you mentioned, the $75 million, I think this is the largest repo authorization we have ever seen out of Molina, right, certainly since your IPO. Do you have a corporate policy on how those shares are to be repurchased over time, a methodology?
John C. Molina: I'm not sure what you mean.
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: So is it going to be pro-rata, is it going to be based on some kind of share price formula relative to a benchmark, is it going to be just purely opportunistic on your part?
John C. Molina: The board gave us latitude, Tom. Really what triggered it was, for a while, our shares were trading below book value and did not make a lot of sense for us to just have a sitdown at that level. So to the extent that we see that the stock is undervalued, we now have the ability to deploy capital to repurchase those shares.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Scott Green with Bank of America.
Scott J. Green - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: What would be your forward view of what a normal cost trend is? And you've executed well to keep costs flat here. How long do you think that can continue?
John C. Molina: Scott, I'm not sure that, in our business, there is one normal cost trend. We've got 10 health plans with 10 different things happening in each of them. So realistically, we don't look at what the future cost trends may be. What we've got to do is manage within the budget that the state gives us.
Joseph Mario Molina: And -- this is Mario. Let me just add, states have the ability to influence cost trends. A good example is what's happening in California where they are decreasing rates to providers, and this is not uncommon in the Medicaid program for states to make adjustments to the benefits or to the payments they make to providers, and that influences what our medical cost trend will be. And that's really beyond our control. That's set by the states.
Scott J. Green - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. So when states are sitting down and calculating what a rate of date [ph] should be going forward, they have to make some projection of trend. Is there some general range that they use in some of your more mature core markets?
John C. Molina: No, I don't want to generalize it. I mean, what you saw as an example, our rate in Florida ended up being 7.5% because of where our population is distributed in that state relative to the state as a whole, which I think the state gave out rates that were basically flat, but because of where we were in the cost in those particular submarkets of Florida, we were able to get a higher rate increase.
Joseph Mario Molina: Yes. This is Mario again. The rates must be actuarially sound, and so each state must look at the rates independently based on the experience and come up with an actuarially sound rate, and they do it typically in rate sales. So it may vary from geographic region to geographic region, it may vary depending on the 8 code [ph] of the beneficiaries. So it's a complex thing and it's very difficult to generalize a single number. I mean, I think you can look back over the years and probably come up with some numbers, but again, it's a mosaic. It's lots of little pieces that get blended together to come up with the final number.
Scott J. Green - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And could we assume that your rate increase in Florida is adequate so that you remain in all your counties? I think you had spoken last quarter about using the rates to gauge your future operations in a few of the reform counties?
Joseph Mario Molina: We are happy with the rates that we receive in Florida.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.
Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Can you give us any update on the Washington State rebid? Has there been any new information there in terms of how that business is going to work and what populations are going to be included there?
Terry P. Bayer: This is Terry Bayer. I believe at our Investor Day we didn't quite have the fully released RFP, so I can update now. That RFP is released. It is due back to the state on December 2, and at this time, the current populations as well as they have added the SSI population in Washington, so that will be a new population based on this RFP.
Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And do you have some dollar numbers around how big that will be?
Terry P. Bayer: No, not at this time.
Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then, can you talk a little bit about the Wisconsin rate environment? You had a tough rate there at the beginning of this past year of 2011 and sort of moving, getting closer to the 2012 rate. Have you been in discussions with them about sort of your situation on MLR there and what they're likely going to do with the rates in 2012?
John C. Molina: We certainly shared our data with the Medicaid agency at the state of Wisconsin, but at this point they haven't given us final rates.
Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Any feeling for which direction that's going to go or is it too early to tell?
John C. Molina: I think it's too early to tell.
Operator: Our next question will come -- is a follow-up question from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel.
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Question on California again. And I think it was Josh that brought it up that you had highlighted that you haven't recorded any potential recovery of provider payments, you've only taken a hit against your potential reimbursement loss. I'm trying to think how -- I know you said you haven't thought about quantifying that yet but tell me if this is kind of an appropriate back-of-the-envelope way of looking at it. If you've got $7.5 million this quarter, let's say you have another $7.5 million next quarter for $15 million total, let's assume you can mitigate half of that. I mean, can I estimate that $7.5 million you might get back, and if I tax adjust that, that's like $0.10 a share on a full year that your guidance could be underestimated by? Meaning you should be reporting a higher number by about $0.10 cents? Is that a way to think about it or am I way off base?
John C. Molina: The challenge, Tom, is what's that -- your initial math is right, 7.5 and 7.5. The challenge is what's the percentage that we can get back, and the real issue for us is California tends to have more IPAs and so those contracts need to be negotiated one-on-one. And then I believe that inpatient and pharmacy are also going to be a challenge. I think inpatient may be excluded from that rate cut, and there's something about pharmacy to where it can or can't be adjusted. That's why we haven't done it. I'm just trying to be conservative until the rates actually come out. We certainly can't tell with the providers now.
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: So -- but that's the math though, right? I mean, if you could mitigate half of what I just threw out there, it would be like $0.10 a share?
Joseph Mario Molina: That's probably right, Tom. It's just a question of what are the final rates going to be, how much of this fee-for-service cut can we pass on to the providers, how much we will be able to recoup. I think to the extent that we're paying people off the Medicaid fee schedule, recoupment shouldn't be a big problem, but as John points out, a lot of our physician payments in California are tied to capitation rates. So...
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: It's contracted...
Joseph Mario Molina: There's definitely some upside that we're not taking into account right now, but we don't know how much. I wouldn't expect it to be huge number.
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: So it doesn't sound like that amount would be recouped in this calendar year, given the process and the nuances of California provider contracting?
Joseph Mario Molina: You mean before the end of 2011?
Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Yes, yes.
Joseph Mario Molina: No, I don't think so. This is going to be more 2012 recoupments.
Operator: Our last question for today will be a follow-up question from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: On the bond -- on the buying back to converts versus the stock, looks like the converts are trading at roughly $0.97 on the dollar. Obviously the stock is where it is. Can you sort of tell us how you guys view the relative detract in this, whether you would want to buy the converts at a discount in par or you would prefer to buy the stock here and sort of how do you guys think about that internally?
John C. Molina: We look at it whichever purchase is going to get us the best, ultimately, the best use of our capital. We have repurchased the convert before and we have repurchased stock.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Any sense for what you prefer today?
John C. Molina: Really it goes on a day-by-day basis what the relative prices are of the two.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And then last question. So you guys came up with $1.55 of earnings, that updated number with Q2, and obviously we talked quite a bit about that number and the impact to California at the Investor Day. Can you remind me, when you guys came out with the updated $1.55 with second quarter, were you guys already assuming the 6% cut in California, or were you assuming something less at that time?
John C. Molina: No, we were assuming the 6% cut.
Operator: Dr. Molina, there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back to you. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.
Joseph Mario Molina: Well, I just want first of all to thank all the employees. This has been a very challenging year from a rate standpoint, and the team has pulled together and done a great job of managing our medical costs and at the same time holding down the admin costs. We've managed to improve our status in terms of NCQA accreditation, so I just want to thank everyone who's really pulled together to make this year-to-date successful. I also want to remind everyone that we will be out in New York again for Investor Day in January. So we look forward to seeing you there, and that concludes our presentation. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a great day, everyone.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Molina Healthcare Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, July 21, 2011. I would now like to turn the conference over to Juan José Orellana, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan José Orellana: Thank you, Andre. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare's financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2011. The company's earnings release reporting its results was issued today after the market closed, and is now posted for viewing on our company website. On the call with me today are Dr. Mario Molina, our CEO; John Molina, our CFO; Terry Bayer, our COO; and Joseph White, our Chief Accounting Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. Our comments today will contain forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, including, without limitations, statements regarding expected rate revisions, enrollment in business growth, utilization and unit cost reductions, and an upward revision of our EPS guidance for fiscal year 2011. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release, and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K annual report for fiscal year 2010, our Form 10-Q quarterly reports and our Form 8-K current reports. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab of our company website or on the SEC's website. All forward-looking statements made during today's call represent our judgment as of July 21, 2011, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements. This call is being recorded and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available over the Internet through the company's website at molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina.
Joseph Molina: Thank you, Juan Jose. Hello, everyone, and thank you for participating on the call. Today Molina Healthcare reported earnings per diluted share of $0.38 for the second quarter of 2011. A 41% improvement over the second quarter 2010. We are pleased with these results, which reflect our continued strength and momentum in the Medicaid space, as well as the strategic benefits derived from our diversified business. Even more exciting, though, are the many opportunities over the next few years. These include upcoming Medicaid managed care procurements, ABD population expansions, dual eligible special needs plan expansions and MMIS procurements. With half of the year behind us, the close of the second quarter provides an appropriate point to review the progress of our business, and to talk about the developments since our most recent Investor Day, last January. At that time, we talked about the key measures of our financial performance: revenue, medical cost and administrative cost. Let's review each of these measures in greater detail and spend some time discussing the drivers behind each of them. Premium revenues in the second quarter grew approximately 16% over the same period last year. At our January Investor Day, we said that our revenue growth would primarily be driven by membership increases and membership mix as opposed to premium rate increases. Our results so far this year have been consistent with that expectation. So far, 2011 has seen an acceleration of the transition of the aged, blind and disabled beneficiaries into Medicaid managed care. During the first half of the year, we added 30,000 new ABD members in the Dallas-Fort Worth service area. As of today, we've added 5,000 new ABD members in California as a result of that state's expansion. We expect that our ABD membership in both Texas and California will continue to grow in 2011. Today, ABD members account for nearly 10% of our total enrollment.  We have also seen growth in our Medicare membership. In terms of enrollment, our Medicare special needs plan for dual-eligibles ranks 10th overall nationwide and third in the markets we serve according to the CMS Health Plan Management Systems website. It's important to remember that all of our Medicare Special Needs Plan members are duly eligible for Medicaid and Medicare. The experience we have gained in serving these populations will serve us well, as more of this membership this moves into managed care over the next few years. Please note that both of these populations, ABD and Medicare, have much higher premium revenues than our traditional membership.  Our membership for the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, or TANF, consisting mainly of mothers and children, has remained static during the first 2 quarters of 2011, when compared to the same periods in 2010 and 2009. This is not surprising nor is it cause for concern. As the unemployment rate across our states decline or remain flat, membership growth begins to ease. However, we have plenty of opportunity for continued growth among new populations and new markets.  As we expected, premium rates remain anemic. We received a rate increase in Missouri, but other states like New Mexico and Utah have actually implemented small rates reduction. At the beginning of the year, we said we expected rates to be either flat or down and that mix in enrollment growth would be better indicators of our business than small fluctuations in premium rates. John will provide a summary of rate developments for the remainder of the year during his remarks.  The second key measure of financial performance is medical costs. Little has changed in this area, relative to the trends we shared with you at the first quarter. Overall, utilization tends to be favorable so far this year. Our larger and more established health plans and fiscal agents remain profitable. Our performance in key states like California, Michigan, Louisiana, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Washington and West Virginia demonstrate that with time and effort, we are able to earn a fair return for our investors as we provide quality health care to our members at a lower cost to the taxpayer. The key attributes here are patience and experience. These health plans and fiscal agents developed the size, technical expertise and relationships needed to thrive overtime. We need time to achieve similar results in markets where we are not yet as well established. We continue to build on our experience in Florida, Idaho, Texas and Wisconsin, and we believe we are on the right path to success in each of these states.  In the meantime, our established markets are producing favorable financial results. The medical cost in our new Texas ABD contracts, particularly in the Dallas-Fort Worth region, are running substantially higher than we would like due to both high utilization and high unit cost. We've undertaken a number of measures, focused on both utilization and unit cost reductions, to improve the profitability of the Texas health plan. These utilization and unit cost issues now confronting us in Texas are not new to our Company and over time we will deal with them just as we have dealt with them in our other health plans in the past.  The third measure of financial performance is administrative cost. Here, we must strike a balance between fiscal discipline and making the investments to capitalize on many of the opportunities coming our way in the next few years. We think we have struck the right balance and we projected an administrative cost ratio of 8.4% for all of 2011, back in January. So far, we're right on target. Now, I'd like to comment on some trends we're seeing in our competitive environment. Let me start with Molina Medicaid Solutions. As we identified at the beginning of the year, our revenue and cost of service in this segment would primarily depend on our ability to stabilize our fiscal agent contracts in Idaho and Maine. You may recall that our efforts to correct issues from the system implementations started under Unisys are ongoing and have been more costly than we anticipated. I am pleased to report that we received notice from Idaho that our Medicaid Management Information System, or MMIS, has been approved to exit the pilot phase. This is further evidence of the progress we're making with this contract and gives us confidence as we move towards the key goal of CMS systems certification in both Idaho and Maine. Despite the implementation delays, which are common in the MMIS industry and which can be measured in years for some states and vendors, we are very pleased to have gotten these 2 systems up and running in a timely fashion by industry standards. Now, let me move on to the health plan business. The moderation in organic growth we discussed earlier has not altered the positive outlook we have for our industry. On the contrary, the growing number of RFPs and program expansions ahead of health care reform will boost enrollment significantly, as these programs are implemented. Furthermore, the robust RFP pipeline has enabled us to be more selective and strategic when investing for the long term. In other words, we've determined that we do not have to pursue every opportunity. We will be selective. We can focus our efforts on pursuing those that meet our strategic and financial objectives. For example, after careful consideration, we elected to forego submitting a bid on the Kentucky managed care RFP. In this RFP, over 40% of the evaluation criteria was based on a 3-year price bid, effectively locking in reimbursement rates by projecting medical costs for the next 3 years.  While profitably growing our business is a top priority for us, preserving existing business is just as important. Both Ohio and Washington, states in which we currently operate health plans, have expressed an interest in pursuing RFPs that rebid existing contracts and further expand the program by adding new populations. Ohio intends to release a competitive procurement, either late this month or early in August. Enrollment of the eligible populations is expected to begin in July of 2012. This will also allow Ohio to add additional Medicaid populations, like the dual-eligibles and disabled children, for a number of years without issuing additional procurements. On July 14, Washington reset the probable release date for their Medicaid procurement to September 15, 2011, in order to complete greater analysis and review. The start date of the Washington contract would be July 1, 2012. We believe that our quality scores, strong provider networks, success in managing ABD populations, commitment to Medicaid and our proven success in serving those markets will provide compelling value propositions when these states pursue RFPs. Transitioning high-cost populations from fee-for-service to managed care continues to gain momentum and support across the country. For example, CMS agreed to fund 15 states to design programs that integrate care for Medicaid and Medicare dual-eligibles. Currently, $9 million dual-eligibles consume approximately $300 billion each year for Medicaid and Medicare services combined, mostly in a fragmented fee-for-service system. In California, the state mandated ABD patients in various counties to enroll in existing managed care plans starting in the month of June. As I said, so far we've seen an increase of approximately 5,000 new ABD members. The weighted average per-member per-month revenue on these members is approximately $450, which is about 4.5x higher than the premiums we received for TANF members in California.  Overall, we're pleased with our second quarter results. We're well positioned for the remainder of the year and we're excited about the growing number of opportunities that are rapidly developing in our industry. I will now turn the call over to John to review the second quarter's financials in greater detail.
John Molina: Thank you, Mario. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.38 and as Mario mentioned earlier, up 41% from a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $17 million or 65% over last year. I am pleased to say that this is the highest net income we've ever reported for a second quarter. In addition, the $34.8 million we report for the first 6 months is the highest net income we have ever reported for the first half of the year. EBITDA was up 37% over the same quarter last year. Operating revenue for the quarter was $1.2 billion, up $168 million, or approximately 17%, from the second quarter of 2010.  Our health plans currently serve 1.6 million members. Our total enrollment grew by 147,000 members, or 10%, over the second quarter of 2010. That includes the addition of the Wisconsin plan, as well as the new CHIP and ABD contracts in the state of Texas. Medicare enrollment exceeded 26,000 members, up 29% from the same quarter last year. As Mario discussed, organic growth in our legacy states appears to be moderating. Premium revenue grew 16% in the second quarter of 2011, compared to the same period last year, due to membership and PMPM revenue increases of approximately 10% and 5%, respectively. Medicare premium revenue was $96 million for the first 3 months -- or for the 3-months ended June 30, 2011, compared with $68 million for the 3-months ended June 30, 2010.  As we discussed in January, the rate environment remains difficult. Premium rate changes for the second half of the year are as follows: In Missouri, we received a blended increase of approximately 5%, effective July 1, 2011. In New Mexico, we received a blended reduction of approximately 2.5% effective July 1, 2011. In Utah, we received a blended reduction of approximately 2% effective July 1, 2011. In addition, Texas and California have single rate reductions. The rates have yet to be finalized. In light of this challenging rate environment, it is essential that we aggressively manage our medical costs. Our medical care ratio declined by 190 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to lower utilization. Fee-for-service costs increased approximately 6% PMPM, partially due to the transition of members from capitated provided networks in the fee-for-service networks. Fee-for-service and capitation costs combined increased less than 2% PMPM.  General & administrative expenses for the quarter were $97 million or 8.3% of total revenue, compared with $78 million or 7.8% of total revenue for the same quarter last year. As Mario discussed, we must strike a balance between our traditional practice of tight administrative cost control and the need to prepare for substantial growth and enrollment over the coming few years. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $115 million for the first half 2011, compared with $26 million for the first half of 2010. The company had cash and investments of $885 million and the parent company had cash and investments of $50 million.  Finally, we are increasing our EPS guidance for all of 2011, from a split-adjusted $1.47 to $1.55. Strong performance by our established health plans and fiscal agents, the realization of utilization improvements earlier in the year than we had anticipated, and our expectation that results for our Idaho fiscal agent contract will improve in the second half of 2011, are the primary reasons for this increased guidance. We expect these positive factors to be partially offset by premium rate reductions in some of our health plans and continuing cost challenges in Texas and Florida. We look forward to seeing you in September at our Fall Investor Day. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Just want to make sure I understand the outlook. You did $0.75 in the first half of the year. That looks like it was negatively impacted by this acceleration of some cost in Idaho by the tune of about $0.09 to $0.10. Is it right to think that the core business is looking for sort of a 5-ish cent headwind in the second half of 2011? You know again, operating on the assumption that the MMIS business reduced earnings roughly $0.10 in the first half but that will not occur in the back half of this year.
John Molina: Oh, boy. Chris, I hate -- you know I always hate to point to one thing or the other that magnifies it. When we look at the back half of the year, when I looked at what we had projected in January, which ones of those trends were coming in, in line or ahead so medical utilization was more favorable. I think if you go back to what we projected for MCR for the entire year, it was around 84.2%, 84.3%, somewhere in that neighborhood and we're already there. But we are looking at some pretty healthy -- we are looking at some changes to the downside in terms of rates in places like New Mexico, Utah and as I said, California and Texas have signaled downward.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Okay. What -- Florida should have some rate changes coming up this fall. What are you guys thinking you might see there at this point?
John Molina: At this point, we don't know.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Okay, because they're looking at some, I think, hospital fee schedule reductions 4 to 10-ish percent, something along those lines. So do you think you can still come out with a net positive or a net negative or flat? Any directional sort of flavor you could provide would be great.
Joseph Molina: Hi, this is Mario. We have seen some decreases in utilization, which we're pleased with in Florida. We still think there's a rate problem specially in Broward County. So, we are looking to see what the state does to address those issues. We'll continue to work on lowering our cost as best as we can. But I think part of the Florida story depends on what they do with the premium rates.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Okay, and then my last question. It looks like -- is it fair to assume that, knock on wood, the worst will be behind you in Idaho after this, really in this -- through the second quarter of this year?
Terry Bayer: This is Terry. Yes. The fact that we've been able to exit pilot and we're a year or so post-go live much of the stabilization the system is underway, so we'll be looking forward to getting to more predictable operating levels going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays Capital.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital: Question for John, and I didn't hear it in the prepared remarks, but I see it in the press release. Just to what seemed to be one-time items, I guess, the first in Utah where you talked about the recognition of some premium revenue without any expenses in 2Q. I sort of size that at $0.09 and then there was another $0.02, this is my calculation, at least there's another $0.02 from the premium deficiency reserve reversal in Wisconsin, so I guess an aggregate of $0.11 in the second quarter. I'm just curious those 2 items, were they expected? Was that part of guidance or is that just part of the boost that we're seeing for the full year guidance? And how should we think about that as you were thinking about the second quarter?
Joseph White: It's Joe speaking. Obviously, when we gave guidance back in January, we knew there were going to be challenges in Wisconsin and there was an increment built into that point for the Utah settlement. We were anticipating that.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital: So both of those numbers were in the guidance?
Joseph White: Yes.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital: But there -- I guess just in terms of sort of just forward-looking, you would consider these to be one-time in nature, is that fair?
John Molina: A lot of it is on Wisconsin, Josh, it's John. It depends on how Wisconsin actually performs in the back half of the year. If the performance for one reason rather improves then we might be able to reduce the liability we put in for the premium deficiency reserve. But at this point, we haven't put in anything more guidance on Wisconsin.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital: Got you. Okay, that's helpful. And then just Texas. It sounds like ABDs -- sounds like there's some challenges from an MLR perspective. And I guess Texas put out some financial information for all of you and the competitors in there. And it looks like your G&A ratio is actually trending a little bit above your peers as well. I'm just sort of curious because you're going through the RFP opportunities in Texas. How should we think about that performance in light of what is coming up in terms of awards? And maybe remind us how important financial performance is relative to their expectations and maybe where service ranks for you guys, et cetera.
John Molina: Well, Josh, we talked about the Texas RFP, I think, in January. Obviously, Texas is a state that we put a lot of effort into, getting into it a number of years ago. And we've had some success in getting contracts for the rural CHIP and for the STAR+PLUS. So we are doing our best in Texas. Texas is not much different, I think, than Ohio was several years ago or than California was. We go through some challenges, we focus in on what needs to be fixed and we fix it, and look at Ohio now. Couple or 3 years ago, it looked pretty bleak. So we continue to invest in both our network, refining our network, medical management and fine-tuning the service so that we can achieve and maintain our NCQA accreditation because ultimately it's taking care of the patients that's the most important thing for us.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital: John, you understand because I can't ask about Ohio anymore. I have to start asking about Texas. And then last one, just in Idaho. I hate to sort of belabor this one. It sounds like you're out of the pilot phase, it sounds like now you can recognize or I guess you can bill for certain costs. Does that mean Idaho is break even until the big CMS approval or does it mean you're just getting a portion of your cost covered and it's still not going to keep you whole, I guess, the rest of the year?
Joseph White: Josh, it's Joe speaking. A couple of points. The exit from pilot is a milestone that's unique to the contract. And yes, the exit from pilot will trigger a milestone payment from the state to us. As far as the contract being break-even or not, essentially, after the adjustment we made at June 30, the contract is break-even going forward through the termination of its initial term. Obviously, after the initial term we expect it, like all of our MMIS contracts as they mature, to be considerably more profitable.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital: Okay, okay, so we're just waiting to -- sort of break even until we hear the next milestone.
John Molina: No, essentially break-even as we project it now. Break-even through the termination of the initial contract.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Rex with JPMorgan.
John Rex - JP Morgan Chase & Co: I was just wondering if you could just give a little more color or specifics on exactly what those measures are you did undertake in Texas? And kind of what some of the most problematic areas are; you cited personal care services and such.
Terry Bayer: This is Terry. Let's also keep in mind that putting the ABDs in managed care in the Dallas-Fort Worth area was a first-time event for many of those folks, so this is an educational process. There are continuity of care requirements in the initial period of the contract where you are really not permitted by the state contract to make many changes. So as we do in all of the other markets, we're approaching our cost in 2 ways. One, is to improve our unit costs. Now that we're bigger, and we have some sense of what our enrollment is, we're in a position to negotiate better unit costs with our providers and that would include the home care providers, as well as others providing service and secondarily the utilization. So we are going full force to monitor the services that are authorized and ensure that they're in compliance with state regulation. And most of you know, this area has potential for abuse and we're committed to making sure that folks get the services they need and that are allowed under the state agreement.
John Rex - JP Morgan Chase & Co: So is home care the biggest issue that you're seeing right now? I mean, if you, it is?
Terry Bayer: I'll tell you a little bit more about it. It's the personal care services arrangements by which folks who are in their homes instead of institutionalized are receiving more than what you might think of as traditional home care but any -- an array of services in the home.
John Rex - JP Morgan Chase & Co: So should we think about it that you're finding instances of like 24/7 home care or something like that, and that's what you're dealing with or...
Terry Bayer: It's not always 24/7, it will depend on what the members' needs are. It might be need for assistance in daily living, support services during the day.
John Rex - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay, and then just broadly, your other utilization commentary. I think similar to last quarter, I think you cited a decline in inpatient bed days. It looks like you're citing that this time also broadly across the book. Can you kind of spike out any specifics there in what you're seeing driving that?
Joseph Molina: This is Mario. I think it's a combination of a sort of a secular trend. I think everyone is seeing decreases in utilization. I think we've also been working to improve our medical management to be sure that we are having the right people in the hospital at the right time and eliminate overutilization. So it's a maturation of some of our medical management as well. But I think it's a combination of those 2.
John Rex - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And Mario, is OB still having an impact there? Are you still seeing declining birthrates or has that stabilized and started trending up again?
Joseph Molina: No, the birthrates seem to be flat.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.
Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG: Just a first question just on the Medicaid Solutions business. And it might be helpful if you have an updated estimate on the cost of services ratio for the full year just given that the quarterly trends have certainly been bouncing around quite a bit on the margin side in that business in the last few quarters.
Joseph White: Hi, it's Joe speaking. I think if you will look at the second half of the year standalone, you might look to 10% to 12%.
Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay, that's helpful. Then second question, Mario, maybe if you can give us your latest read on the intelligence that you're hearing out of Washington. Just on the deficit reduction discussions and how those impact Medicaid. Clearly, events are moving by the second there, but maybe just a summary would be helpful.
John Molina: Did you mention intelligence and Congress in the same sentence?
Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG: That I did and that was -- I don't know what I was thinking there but...
Joseph Molina: Well, the whole thing is really very much up in the air. I think there are things that could be done, like the acceleration of the movement of the Duals into managed care, that can really help with this deficit issue, at the same time providing the same or frankly better levels of care for the beneficiaries at a lower cost. One of the things we see with the Duals is that frequently, when they get into managed care, they have somebody to help them. And it's really interesting some of the calls we've gotten on our member services line, people saying things like, "I've never really had anyone help me before." So I think that is something that could be a win for the patients and a win for the budget. Beyond that, I don't really want to speculate as to what Congress is going to do.
Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay. Then just any updates you can give us on Louisiana. I know you don't usually talk about sort of bidding on a new business, but is it your expectation that we should hear an update on that on Monday?
Joseph Molina: You know I don't know what's happening with the bids in Louisiana, so I can't tell you.
Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay. Then just last question. Just going back to California ABD. Any initial sense of how the utilization is tracking down there? I know you just started ramping up there in June, but just any sense of initial cost relative to expectation? And then do you have an estimate for how much ABD membership you're expecting to have in California in the back half of the year?
Joseph Molina: Well, what I would say on that is that we've had ABD members on a voluntary basis in California for some time. We have contracts and networks put together. So it's a little bit different scenario than what you have in Texas where you rolled a lot of people into a new system. As far as we can tell right now, the utilization in California appears to be consistent with previous experience. As far as the estimates of the enrollment, we gave an estimate at the Investor Day and I think we're going to stick with that. That was about 12,000 members.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Lavine with UBS.
Kenneth Lavine - UBS Investment Bank: As was referenced in the call earlier, to see that TANF enrollments have been largely stable since the latter part of 2010. I was just curious about the levers of that stable memberships just in terms of this -- do you see anything in terms of changes perhaps in the trajectory of monthly gross adds versus maybe being offset by people staying on Medicaid longer and if there's any kind of numbers you put around that?
Joseph Molina: This is Mario again. I don't want to get into specifics, but I think that generally speaking, what we have seen is a flattening out of the enrollment, and this reflects a modest improvement in the economy. At the same time, the requirement for maintenance of effort is also helping to maintain the current levels. I don't anticipate big changes either upward or downward over the next couple of quarters unless we were to take market share but I mean it's -- I think that the Medicaid population has stabilized and growth will moderate over the next few quarters.
Kenneth Lavine - UBS Investment Bank: Okay, I got it. It's helpful. And also in Ohio, you guys have done a great job there. The recent strong margins certainly look to reflect that. And I was just wondering how the impending RFP might change the margin trajectory there. Is this something that may drive some sort of margin reset to an extent in the first year of the renewal, assuming that you retain the business?
John Molina: Ohio has not typically done a price bid in the previous RFPs that we've looked at, so we certainly will be going to a rate discussion with the state for an effective date of January 1. We are also anticipating the carve-in of the pharmacy benefit back in later this year. So those things will have some impacts that we really can't quantify at the moment.
Operator: Our next question comes the line of Brian Wright with Citadel Securities.
Brian Wright - Citadel Securities, LLC: Could you just walk us a little bit through the decision to increase the completion factor to about 150 basis points year-over-year this quarter? Because it just seems a little at odds with the per-member inventory at the end of the quarter being flat year-over-year?
Joseph White: Are you talking about claims reserves, Brian? It's Joe.
Brian Wright - Citadel Securities, LLC: Yes, exactly.
Joseph White: Yes. We developed our claims reserves essentially just based on what our actuaries develop and obviously reviewed by the actuary team of our independent auditors. I don't know that there is a specific intent to change completion factors. It is just more or less what falls out of the analysis. Obviously, days in claims payable is down, but I would also point out that our run out from 12/31/10 is again very consistent year-over-year.
Brian Wright - Citadel Securities, LLC: Okay, and then lastly, with the potential -- if you just give us an update on the Louisiana or the MMIS contract down there. You're protesting it. So because it's under protest, you're not going to make any decisions as far as asset kind of impairment or anything like that until that protest is either won or lost or whatever? Is that?
Joseph White: Brian, it's Joe speaking again. Let me talk a little bit about that. A couple of points to bear in mind. First of all, even if we were to lose that contract, we're going to continue to serve the state while the new system is developed for several years. So we have -- when we lost the contracts, we did undertake a potential impairment analysis and that analysis as of today indicates that even if we were to lose that contract, we would not have any goodwill impairment of the MMIS goodwill.
Operator: Our next question comes the line of Carl McDonald with Citigroup.
Carl McDonald - Citigroup Inc: Could you remind me on the 55,000 Medicaid lives in Florida, the breakdown between reformed counties and non-reform counties? I remember, in fact, I think the bulk of it is in reform counties.
Joseph White: Yes, I think it's about 60/40 reform and a big chunk of that's Broward County.
Carl McDonald - Citigroup Inc: Okay. And is it right to think about the cost pressures that you're seeing in Florida relating primarily to the reformed counties? Or is it more widespread across the entire book?
Joseph White: I think that Broward County is front and center in terms of things that have to be addressed.
Carl McDonald - Citigroup Inc: And then the other question is just, Utah has talked about some potential changes to their Medicaid program. It sounds like moving away from managed care to something else more like an accountable care organization. I'm just interested in your thoughts on that in terms of likelihood of that change happening and then also if it does, the timing around that.
Joseph White: Carl, I wouldn't say that that's 100% accurate. I mean, what the state of Utah wants to do is they want to put more members into risk environments. We are, right now, the only plan that's fully at risk in Utah. The other 2 plans that take care of Medicaid beneficiaries are not at risk. So it's really -- and they're provider-based systems. So the whole notion of accountable care organizations really is to draw those folks into a greater risk contract arrangement.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes the line of Sarah James with Wedbush.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc.: It looks like there was somewhat of an uptick in physician and outpatient costs, and I'm wondering how much of this is pricing versus volume. And if it is volume, is this being driven by some new populations coming on or a possible shift of where people are choosing to get the care done?
John Molina: Sarah, this is John. I think there's a couple of factors there. One, we did terminate some capitated contracts and moved them to fee-for-service so you would see an increase in physician and outpatient services. And then also with the increase in membership in Dallas for the STAR+PLUS, there's an lot of outpatient services. The personal care services that Terry talked about earlier would be classified as outpatient services. I think those are the 2 primary things. We're not really seeing across-the-board rate increases in physician unit cost.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc.: And is there any update on some of the MMIS RFPs? I know Vermont and Arkansas were expected out around this time.
John Molina: I'm sorry, Sarah, could you say it again, you kind of faded out at the end.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc.: Sorry, I was wondering if there's any update on the MMIS RFPs possibly for Vermont or Arkansas?
John Molina: Vermont had an RFP and they decided to pull it and are re-examining the direction they want to go. Arkansas, I think, is still in drafting if I'm not mistaken.
Terry Bayer: But it's really in the question. It's in the question period for bidders.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Charles Boorady with Credit Suisse.
Charles Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG: First question, on Texas, just, you talked about the challenges there, and I'm just wondering how long they take to address and approximately when do you expect the loss ratio to get into your targeted range.
Joseph Molina: Charles, that's a really good question. I think that there's a certain amount of pent-up demand in Texas that we're seeing with the move of the STAR+PLUS patients into managed care. I think that there is a certain maturation that has to go on of that health plan in terms of gearing up their management systems. I think we're a little bit behind the curve there. And it will take in the order of a few quarters I would imagine. I can't give you an exact answer. It's going to be what it turns out to be. It's certainly getting a lot of attention and somebody mentioned about the resources. I think that we're putting a lot of resources into Texas right now. And part of that is not only to deal with the STAR+PLUS utilization that we're seeing in Dallas but also to build in preparation for the contracts that will come with the next RFPs. So there's some infrastructure building going on there as well.
Charles Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG: Got it. And you used to show -- I remember a few Investor Days ago, you had a chart showing how as new lives aged, the loss ratios improved because of the sort of pent-up demand as they first enrolled. So is this sort to be expected, kind of a typical experience and one that we should expect with any start-up market in new populations coming in? Or would you also say that there is certain execution failures that you need to address, things that went wrong operationally that shouldn't have gone wrong?
John Molina: Charles, first of all let me compliment you on your memory. That's pretty good because that was about 3 Investor Days ago we did that chart. I think that our expectation is that Dallas will follow the same pattern. I think where it's different in Dallas is that the initial spike is higher than we are used to seeing and that surprises a bit. But we're confident that as it follows the same pattern and we put in things like prior authorization for certain services as the cognitive care requirements come away and as we renegotiate contracts especially with the myriad of home care providers and sort of narrow the network down that we'll get some traction on the medical cost side.
Joseph Molina: This is Mario. I think there are a lot of parallels with what we saw in Ohio. Small health plans struggling with some growing pains. As the membership grows, we'll be in a better position to go back to some of the providers and get better contracts. I think that the medical management staff will mature over time. I also think it's an interesting contract with California because in California, you have mandatory enrollment of the ABD patients but we've already had voluntary enrollment. So there are some patients that have already enrolled on a voluntary basis and we have experience with them. We also have a much larger contracting base in California just because we've been here for a long time and have lot of members. So that's why I think California is a little bit different than what we're seeing in Texas.
John Molina: And let me add one more thing and, not to beat a dead horse, but the Dallas contract is unique in that inpatient is carved out, behavioral health is carved out and pharmacy is carved out. That presents 2 challenges. One, it presents a challenge for folks to have to manage that to make sure that we're providing the right services and not providing services that the state has carved out and carved out really for the right sides. So it's also a challenge for the state to make sure that they've nailed the right side adequately.
Charles Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG: So when we hear from Texas in a few weeks about your wins and we try to model your wins and the ramping up of some of these ABD lives with the new contract, is it fair to say that we should not expect the loss ratio to be quite this high? It should be high but not quite this high because of some of the unusual situations like the home care and other things that you talked about that affected this business?
John Molina: I would say that that's a fair statement from about 50,000 feet. But then I'd also encourage you to come talk to us in September when we have our Investor Day because I would imagine that this would be one of the primary topics we'll talk about.
Charles Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG: And Ohio, since Josh kind of -- he said that he can't ask about it anymore, I'll pick up that baton. You're doing great there, and I just want to confirm that's a calendar year end right before you get new rates. Am I right on that? And then what would you expect the state's response to be in light of your success there in keeping costs low. What would a normal loss ratio fee that you would expect going forward?
Joseph Molina: Well, normally-- well I should not say normally, the rate year for Ohio is a January to December rate year. It follows the calendar year. When we get the responsibility for pharmacy back in, and I believe it's October, there will be an adjustment for that benefit. When the states are setting the rates, individual health plan performance is a factor but it is not the only factor because there are other plans in Ohio that may be doing as well, better or worse than we are. So they've got to set a rate that's sort of across-the-board. I don't know what -- if Ohio has a targeted loss ratio or not.
Charles Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay, and then just my last question. The drop in the days claims payable, I think, you addressed it a little bit. I'm not sure if I captured the essence of why it was down and whether you can share the prior period reserve developments that related to this year and that related to last year that were included in today's results.
Joseph Molina: Well, We always disclose prior period reserve development from 12/31 of preceding year and it's consistent with what we've seen in other years. 3/31 is a little bit immature right now to talk about.
Charles Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG: Got it, okay. Can you tell us what you baked in, in the results you reported that related to 3/31?
Joseph Molina: We don't really look at it that way, Charles.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Scott Green with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Scott Green - BofA Merrill Lynch: So a question on Dallas. My understanding was that Amerigroup was managing some of these lives on an ASO basis before they transitioned to managed care? So I mean, did the population just have the traditional behavioral patterns of people in fee-for-service or what was that like when you brought some of those lives on?
John Molina: Scott, I'm not aware of what Amerigroup was or wasn't doing in Dallas. So I can't comment on that. What we're seeing is, we are seeing some pent-up demand. We're seeing -- I think that one of the concerns was when folks found out about managed care and greater access to services, they utilized them. So whether that's ER or some of your primary care services or personal attendant services, we are seeing an increase in utilization for services.
Joseph Molina: And I think it's fair to say that the utilization patterns we're seeing in Dallas are different than what we are seeing in other parts of the state.
John Molina: That's correct.
Joseph Molina: I mean, those are the factual things we can tell you. As far as what Amerigroup did, you can ask them when they have their call.
Scott Green - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay, and they're different than other parts of the state just because it's an immature population or because of the home care stuff you described previously?
John Molina: Part of it is the fact that it was fee-for-service before and other areas went to a more mature managed care market. Part of it is a different benefit pattern. I think in Houston, we have behavioral health carved in. So there are differences a lot in the contracts. That's why one of the nice things about the RFP is that it's going to be more uniform across the state in terms of the benefits that are carved in and carved out, and our responsibility will increase for things like inpatient and pharmacy.
Scott Green - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay, all right. And then, are there any other states besides Michigan and Washington where members are transitioning to fee-for-service networks from capitation? Those were the only 2 out in the press release.
John Molina: Because those were pretty big groups where we changed the contractual relationships. It happens to a lesser degree in other states, but Washington and Michigan had some pretty big groups that we did at transition.
Scott Green - BofA Merrill Lynch: And those are your re-contracting initiatives? I thought I remembered last conference call, you might have mentioned that the providers were increasingly preferring to participate in the fee-for-service networks instead of capitation?
John Molina: That was the case in Michigan. I believe in Washington, it was just the economics didn't work out for us to continue the capitation contracts with those groups.
Scott Green - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay. And so the MLRs in those markets actually fell sequentially. So you don't see when that transition happens to a fee-for-service network that just the incentives of the providers change and you see some utilization increase. You're not seeing any of that?
John Molina: No.
Scott Green - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay. So on the front page of the press release where you talked about fee-for-service and capitation cost up 2% sequentially. So I just wanted to make sure I understand that because there could be mix changes going on there too, but it is the way to think about that since the MLR excluding the Utah issue, the Utah payment that you received, and Texas, which is a new population. The MLR was essentially flat sequentially excluding those items, and I don't think rates changed sequentially between first quarter and second quarter. Is cost trend basically flattish sequentially? If your rates are kind of flattish sequentially and the MLR was flattish sequentially?
John Molina: It's pretty flattish, yes.
Scott Green - BofA Merrill Lynch: And then for California, where you spoke about an expectation for a modest rate reduction. Is there any consideration in that for changes to the provider rates that were also proposed? Or is that a separate issue? Because I believe -- I recall in the budget proposal, there was a modest increase but also potentially a provider rate cut. So I'm not sure if you were netting those out or those are 2 distinct issues.
John Molina: I think that those are 2 distinct issues. We know one and we don't know the impact. Or we've gotten information on one but not of the other. So that's why didn't explicitly say this is what California is doing to the rates.
Scott Green - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay, but you said they're going down?
John Molina: Correct.
Joseph Molina: We anticipate the premium rates will go down in California.
Scott Green - BofA Merrill Lynch: And then we're waiting to see on what happens with the provider rate issue?
Joseph Molina: Yes.
Scott Green - BofA Merrill Lynch: And you mentioned Broward County specifically a couple of times. I just wanted to make sure I understand. So is that a county potentially you would consider exiting if the rate update in September was not what you deem to be appropriate because before you kind of said that it's an investment market and you're going to stick it out like you do in other markets?
John Molina: We need to see what happens with the rates for all of Florida and specifically for Broward County before we make decisions and want to call out that we may or may not exit the county.
Joseph Molina: This is Mario. Let me just also comment on that. When you look at the premium rates by county in Florida, they vary tremendously. And one of the things we're hoping the state will do is to come up with a little bit more uniform rates and spread the money around across all the counties. But having said that, we will give serious consideration to exiting Broward County if we can't get adequate rates. I mean, that's just the way it is. We've done that in the past in other states, in other areas. We're not afraid to leave a county if we have to. We will give it a good try. We'll work with the state and present our arguments as to why the rates need to be adjusted. But in the end, if the premium rates are just not adequate, we can't stay.
John Molina: And Broward has been a challenging county. I think there are a couple of other health plans that exited in the last 12 months or so.
Joseph Molina: We're patient but there is a limit to our patience.
Scott Green - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay, and you might be stress testing some of these limits as it relates to Broward. You're calling out Broward, it seems like. What -- can you tell us what the MLR is in Broward for your book?
John Molina: No, we don't go down to that level of detail. We go to a lot of detail, but MLR by county is getting a little too granular.
Scott Green - BofA Merrill Lynch: Can you remind me how many lives you have in Broward?
John Molina: On top of my head, I don't recall. I think it's about 60% of the total.
Joseph Molina: Yes, I think so. So it's probably 25%, 30%, 30,000.
Scott Green - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay, because the MLR sequentially in Florida, it seems like it was basically unchanged up 35 basis points or so. But you're suggesting the Broward MLR deteriorated sequentially?
John Molina: We're not suggesting anything right now. Broward is an issue. There are other issues in Florida that we're getting addressed. Some of these things that we're addressing are within our control, and some of them, like the rates are not completely in our control. So we are just going to work through the rate process and see what happens. Again, we'll update you when we have more information.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session for today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Orellana. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan José Orellana: Well, thanks everyone for joining us and as John mentioned, we will see you at Investor Day in September.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the presentation for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Molina Healthcare First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Juan José Orellana, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan Jose Orellana: Thank you, Shawna. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare's financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2011. The company's earnings release reporting its results was issued today after the market closed, and is now posted for viewing on our company website.  On the call with me today are Dr. Mario Molina, our CEO; John Molina, our CFO; Terry Bayer, our COO; and Joseph White, our Chief Accounting Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. Our comments today will contain forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, including statements regarding our guidance for 2011. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K annual report for fiscal year 2010, our Form 10-Q quarterly reports and our Form 8-K current reports. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab of our company's website or on the SEC's website. All forward-looking statements made during today's call represent our judgment as of April 18, 2011, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements. This call is being recorded and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available over the Internet through the company's website at molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina.
Joseph Molina: Thank you, Juan José, and welcome, everyone. We know that many people are celebrating a holiday this evening. John and I will therefore keep our remarks brief, so that those observing the holiday can get to their friends and families.  Just a few months ago, we completed an important year for Molina Healthcare. We celebrated the company's 30th year in business, as well as our success in delivering strong earnings growth in 2010. We exceeded the guidance provided, and the company's financial position was strengthened as a result of our operational results. Today, I am pleased to report that our first quarter results have given us a solid start toward achieving the financial guidance we provided for 2011. Our financial results improved dramatically over the first quarter of 2010. Implementation of various contracting and medical management incentives resulted in lower medical costs across our Consolidated Health Plans segment during the first quarter of 2011. Inpatient utilization dropped by 7% compared with the first quarter of last year, while pharmacy utilization was flat despite the return to a more typical influenza pattern. Overall, our Medical Care ratio dropped by approximately 80 basis points year-over-year. Premium revenue per-member per-month increased by only 1% in the first quarter. Our larger and more established health plans fared the best in the first quarter. California, Ohio, Utah and Washington all have lower medical care ratios when compared to the first quarter of 2010. And Michigan's medical care ratio was up slightly. At some of our smaller or newer health plans, we continued to confront challenges during the first quarter that resulted in medical cost trends that exceeded premium growth. In Wisconsin, our newest and smallest health plan in terms of enrollment, greater visibility into our cost trends due to longer experience and a reduction in premium rates by 11% January 1, 2011, triggered the establishment of a premium deficiency reserve of approximately $3 million in the first quarter of 2011. This is one of the most dramatic rate cuts that we've experienced at one of our health plans. The medical care ratio in Florida remains elevated. However, there is indication that we are making progress as the medical care ratio declined 360 basis points sequentially. As we've discussed in the past, we expect medical cost to remain volatile and elevated in our smaller markets until we gain additional market share, enabling us to establish better provider relationships with those providers that are the most cost-effective. We now have about 1 full year of operational experience with our Fiscal Agent business, Molina Medicaid Solutions. During that time, we have gained valuable insights into the business and we have a better appreciation for the earnings and the revenue recognition patterns associated with the design, development and implementation or DDI phase of new contracts. Our efforts in Idaho and Maine to correct issues from the original implementation under Unisys are taking longer and are more costly than we anticipated. On the other hand, the margins in our fiscal agent contracts in New Jersey, Louisiana and West Virginia remain stable.  We firmly believe that the government healthcare sector in which we compete is an attractive growth industry. There is considerable amount of Medicaid activity that is taking place ahead of healthcare reform. For example, the Texas RFP, which had been delayed, has now been released with a due date of May 23. In Ohio and Michigan, both dates are exploring making managed care mandatory for the due eligible population. In Florida, state legislature approved the proposal to reduce long-term cost by moving a portion of its Medicaid population into managed care. And in California, a large portion of the state's aged, blind and disabled Medicaid beneficiaries will be required to enroll with a managed care plan starting in June of this year.  Overall, we had a successful first quarter. I firmly believe our results validate our strategic imperatives, emphasizing diversification, financial strength and profitable growth. We are very well positioned for the year ahead, and I look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.  I will now turn the call over to John to review the quarter's financials in greater detail.
John Molina: Thank you, Mario. We are very pleased with our results for this quarter. EPS for the quarter was $0.56, up 37% from a year ago. Net income from the quarter was $17 million, up 64% over last year and EBITDA was up 62% over last year. Operating revenue for the quarter was $1 billion, up $153 million or approximately 16% from the first quarter of 2010.  Our total enrollment grew by 165,000 members or 11% over the first quarter of 2010. This growth is mainly attributed to solid organic growth in Texas and Ohio, as well as the acquisition of our Wisconsin Health Plan. In Texas, the 2 recent RFP awards, 1 for CHIP members in September of 2010 and 1 for STAR+PLUS members this past February, have more than tripled our enrollment in that state since last August. In Wisconsin, our acquisition of the plant closed in September of 2010, which enhances year-over-year growth.  Sequentially, our enrollment rose by 34,000 members over the fourth quarter of 2010. Medicare enrollment grew by 43% over the first quarter of last year and we now serve approximately 24,000 Medicare members. Today, Medicare accounts were 1.5% of our membership and approximately 8% of our revenue. Our membership growth was essentially the sole driver of higher revenue for the quarter, as blended premium revenue per-member per-month grew only 1%. Although we have received relatively small rate increases in states like Ohio, California, Utah and Washington over the past year, we have seen substantial cuts in states like New Mexico and Wisconsin. As Mario touched upon, medical costs that exceeded premium growth in Wisconsin due to an 11% rate decrease on January 2011 require the establishment of a premium deficiency reserve of approximately $3 million in the first quarter of 2011.  We've also seen a shift in our member mix as growth in the lower premium membership from Wisconsin and the Texas CHIP expansion have more than offset the increase in ABD members we experienced in the Dallas, Fort Worth area in February. Therefore, the dynamic rate environment in our markets, which combines rate increases in some states, rate decreases in others and changes in membership mix, further reinforces the need for diversification across multiple health plans. In light of this environment, we have made the most of any premium rate increases we have received by better managing our medical costs. Our medical care ratio declined by 80 basis points year-over-year. Despite the return of a flu season, hospital utilization declined by 7% and pharmacy utilization was flat.  Pharmacy costs, after adjusting for the carve out of the pharmacy benefit in Ohio, increased approximately 5% PMPM quarter-over-quarter. Capitation cost decreased approximately 15% PMPM, primarily due to the transition of members in Michigan and Washington into fee-for-service networks. Fee-for-service costs increased approximately 4% PMPM. Much of this increase was due to the transition of members from capitated provider networks into fee-for-service networks. Fee-for-service and capitation costs combined increased less than 1% PMPM.  General and administrative expenses were $94 million or 8.4% of total revenue compared with $79 million or 8.2% of total revenue for the same quarter last year. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $82 million for the first quarter of 2011 compared with cash used in operating activities of $27 million for the first quarter of 2010. First quarter cash flow was lifted by the early receipt of our April Ohio premium. We do not expect Ohio to pay again early this year, so all other things being equal, you can expect cash flow to show a drop in the second quarter. The company had cash and investments of approximately $871 million. The parent company had cash and investments of approximately $26 million. Finally, we are reaffirming our EPS guidance for 2011 of $2.20.  We are very pleased with our results this quarter. However, as you know, government budget deficits are not expected to improve in the remainder of 2011. Accordingly, the rate environment for the company's health plan remains uncertain, making any adjustment to guidance unwarranted at this time. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays Capital.
Joseph Kuhns - Barclays Capital: This is Joe Kuhns, filling in for Josh today. First 1 is, can you just give us an update? I know you talked a little bit about the RFPs. But I guess in terms of timing, which are the ones that are coming up next and when should we expect, for California specifically, when should we expect to start seeing some ABD members come in?
John Molina: Well, let's talk about California for a second. This is John. The ABD members should start to come on the roads in June or July of this year and it was done not through a separate RFP. As Mario discussed, the Texas RFP came out with a due date of May 23. There've been a couple of RFPs in the MMS space. But beyond that, I don't think that we have much of a signal other than what's already out there which you guys and all the analysts have been covering.
Joseph Kuhns - Barclays Capital: Right. And were you surprised at all specifically about Texas that the effective start date didn't change given the delay?
John Molina: No.
Joseph Kuhns - Barclays Capital: And anything else for that matter surprising in your opinion on the Texas RFP?
Joseph Molina: This is Mario. We did not find anything surprising about the Texas RFP.
Joseph Kuhns - Barclays Capital: Okay, thanks. And I know you're obviously reaffirming 2011 guidance. Any comment today on 2012 guidance or are you leaving that off the table for now?
Joseph Molina: I think we made some comments at our Investor Day about 2012. I don't think we want to go beyond what we said previously.
Joseph Kuhns - Barclays Capital: Okay. And just 1 more, if I may. I guess this is really more of a logistical question, but was -- I guess, what was the decision process in terms of reporting so early in earnings season? Usually, I think, last year you guys were around the first week of May. So just curious to see why you moved up the date.
John Molina: You hit the nail on the head. It was logistics. We have our shareholder meeting next week. We've got spring break for my kids and a couple of other folks have spring break coming up. So it was just easier to get it done early.
Joseph Kuhns - Barclays Capital: Understood. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Thomas Carroll: A few questions. On the transition of the capitated costs from fee-for-service to -- I'm sorry, from capitation to fee-for-service in Washington and Michigan, is this more of a proactive approach on your part as you expect the rate environment to be challenging in the coming years, or is this just more reflective of how the population is choosing providers?
Joseph Molina: No, I think this is more an issue of -- this is Mario, Tom. This is an issue of provider preference and the way they have chosen to be paid, which I think is really ironic because there's been so much talk about the cannibal care organizations which would put providers at risk, and yet more and more of the providers are coming to us saying they want fee-for-service contracting arrangements.
Thomas Carroll: So this is the docs actually saying they want to get paid fee-for-service.
Joseph Molina: Correct.
Thomas Carroll: Interesting. Okay. What drove the RX costs in Washington state, and does that suggest anything about future claims flow?
Joseph White: Tom, it's Joe speaking. I think in both California and Washington when we look at pharmacy costs, I think the biggest impact this quarter was a continuing diminution of pharmacy rebates. We talked about the pharmacy rebates we received via the pharmaceutical manufacturers drying up as the states collect that. Also, curiously enough, those are 2 of the -- I guess not curiously, those are 2 of the states where we had high synergist use as a result of the synergist season. Also, there's are 2 of the states where we had probably the least, probably have the highest RX utilization creep for the quarter. Essentially a combination of factors, but I think what really stands out for them this quarter is the way they've been hit by the loss of the pharmacy rebates.
Thomas Carroll: Okay. And then lastly, what's the decrease in admissions per thousand, was that focused in any 1 or 2 markets or mostly evenly spread?
Joseph White: We saw that pretty much everywhere, except our Missouri and our Ohio plants, otherwise very consistent.
Thomas Carroll: Very good. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc.: Thank you. I was wondering how we should think about seasonality. I think yesterday you indicated 2011 would be more back-end loaded than past years, and if I adjust for the Wisconsin reserve fees of about $0.07 and the MMS margin step up in the second half, does the year still look like 60% second half, 40% first half? [Technical Difficulty]
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc.: Sure. Yes. I was wondering how I should think about seasonality. At the Investor Day, you guys had mentioned that you're being more back-end loaded than past years, so if you adjust for the Wisconsin reserves it would be $0.07. And the second half step up in MMS margins, I was wondering if the year still looks like 60% second half, 40% first half?
Joseph White: I think, Sarah, rather than trying to pigeonhole or pinpoint how much is coming from back half versus first half, what I would say is first quarter is ahead of, I think, even our expectations. But I'm just being a little cautious because of the rate environment. It's still in flux.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc.: Do you have any basic assumptions for the second half rate?
Joseph Molina: I'm sorry, say that again, Sarah?
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc.: Do you have any assumptions for the second half rates currently built into your 2011 guidance that you could share with us?
Joseph Molina: What I would say is there's really been no change to the information we provided in January at our Investor Day. I think what's changed for us is that the first quarter results came in a little bit better than anticipated and a lot of that had to do with lower hospital utilization. It's a good sign because that's something that we have some control over. But I would be cautious about extrapolating the whole year based on 1 quarter. So really, no change to guidance, no change to the information that we provided in January, slightly lower medical costs in the first quarter than anticipated leading to better earnings.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc.: Got it. And on the hospital utilization, is there anything in particular that you see that's driving that or any color that you could provide?
Joseph Molina: No, I think this is just a product of our medical management initiatives. We've been trying to push the medical management down to the state health plans, asking our state health plan, CMOs and medical directors to step up a little bit and help us control our medical costs better, especially at a time when we are experiencing minimal rate increases on the premium side.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc.: Better medical management. And the last question is on the clinics. I think you talked about building a couple of clinics in California. I was wondering if there was any update on that.
John Molina: We've still got, I think, 2 more that are scheduled to be open later this year. And we did open our second clinic in Washington in late last year or early this year.
Joseph Molina: That was in December. Plus we've expanded the capacity at 2 of our clinics in California, all of this is anticipation of the influx of the ABD members. We wanted to have a little bit stronger staff model clinic network to be able to handle that growth.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc.: Okay. So would it be fair to say that they would be up and running before the ABD members come in at the end of the year?
Joseph Molina: Yes.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Just to put this utilization issue to rest, it sounds like you're saying the lower utilization was primarily a result of the lower admits in the hospital. Is that correct?
Joseph Molina: Yes, that's correct.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Okay. And are you saying that it was Molina-specific or do you think it was more general broadly to the industry?
Joseph Molina: Well, here's what I would say. It's very difficult to generalize from 1 health plan to another and I would urge everyone to be cautious about that. What we see in the first quarter is higher utilization due to the flu typically. But that's mostly on the outpatient side. So the fact that we had a slightly more intense flu season in 2011 than 2010, but lower medical costs is really reflective of the fact that we had lower hospital utilization. And as I said, we've been struggling for a long time to try and improve our margins and decrease our medical costs, and I think that we're seeing some of the benefit of that work. And I hope that, that will continue for the remainder of the year. But again, I caution everyone to be very careful about trying to extrapolate our performance to the rest of the industry.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Okay, thanks. And then thinking about the guidance for this year, can you tell us what percentage of your member months -- what percentage of your member months you currently have rate visibility on?
John Molina: The only state -- actually 2 states, Ohio and Wisconsin. The rest of them will be a July or October rate change. Like 20%. It's probably 20%, 22%. Do you follow that?
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Sort of. I guess what I'm trying to figure out is that as of today, because these -- there are varying times when the rate changes take effect, how much is locked up? Meaning, what do you know you have for sure and then what percent is still variable for your expectations for 2011?
Joseph White: So basically, it's Joe speaking, Wisconsin and Ohio receive 1/1 rate increases. Everybody else is going to hit either 6/30 or 9/30. So if you look at our earnings release, we break out the enrollment. I think you can just do the arithmetic.
John Molina: 23% total.
Joseph Molina: So 1 way of looking at that is that we have the rate -- we know the rates were slightly more than half. Correct?
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Okay. That's what I'm trying to figure out.
Joseph Molina: Through the second part of the year, we have rates in half. So in July they change or in October they change. So a little more than half of the rates are locked in for this year.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Okay. And then is it possible...
Joseph Molina: Having said that, I also want to caution everyone, that if states run out of money, there's nothing that says they can't come back and adjust the rates downward during the contract period.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Okay. And then last question here on the guidance. Is it possible to tell us whether -- you gave a detailed breakout of the line items at your Investor Day. Did any of those line items change materially since January?
Joseph Molina: No, I don't think so. Our policy has always been if there's a material change, we'll let people know. I think that for the most part, the year is tracking as we anticipated, but with slightly lower hospital utilization and better margins as a result.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Green from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Scott Green - BofA Merrill Lynch: So first, I was reading through the Louisiana RFP, and I thought I read that they were extending the fiscal intermediary vendors contract through 2015. So I was asking is that you? Is your contract extended for another 5 years? Is that new? I didn't see it in risk factors this quarter.
Terry Bayer: This is Terry Bayer. We are the current fiscal intermediary, so a state will often extend the contract to cover the development period should there be a new vendor.
Scott Green - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay. So is there still an RFP you're preparing to submit a bid for there?
Terry Bayer: Yes, we have submitted a bid to reprocure that business. So we are both the incumbent and the potential future awardee of the business going forward.
Scott Green - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay. All right. So that wasn't new from your perspective. You're still competing to retain that business at the same time frame.
Joseph Molina: Yes. I think what the state is signaling is that there is not going to be an abrupt change even if they were to bring in a new contractor, as Terry said, there's a run out period where they would have us probably continue that contract. So I think that's what they're trying to signal to the bidders that there should be minimal disruption to them with regard to the MMIS vendor.
Scott Green - BofA Merrill Lynch: And then secondly, so in Wisconsin, can you clarify the premium deficiency reserve? Is that higher-than-expected cost vary initially as you have gotten claims that are more mature or is it lower revenues there?
Joseph White: This is Joe speaking. I think it's better to say it's generally driven by lower revenues. We took about an 8% cut there effective September 1, 2010, you'll recall and then another 11% on top of that effective January 1. So essentially, the revenue is simply not keeping up with the medical cost.
Scott Green - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay. All right. And then I guess following up on Sarah's question, you had already assumed in your initial guidance 0% per rate update on unsigned contracts going forward. And your results in the first quarter are better than expected. So I guess that means we're assuming something less than zero going forward or just some other conservatism. There may be just a lower number there. Is that based on any conversation you're actually currently having with states where you now think rates might be lower or just general caution?
Joseph White: I would say it's general caution. We will have a much better visibility after the second quarter is done. And we hate to change guidance now when we change again once we have better visibility on rates.
Scott Green - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay. All right. A question on California. So could you just update us on where we are in terms of there was a proposal for 10% provider rate cut in the back half of the year, and I think they're working on some study to show if it would impact access to care or not. There is also some placeholder for a rate increase to HMO plans. So if you could give us your perspective on where we are in that process. And then related to that, in 2008, there was also a proposed 10% provider rate cut in California and you quantified that potential impact at around $0.10 EPS in the back half of the year. And I was wondering if that would be the same way to think about it using those 2008 disclosures that you gave, if that happened to be...
Joseph Molina: Well, this is Mario. What I would say about that is that in the first place, there are a lot of moving parts with the California budget. And as I've said in the past, until the tax receipts come in and you get the May revised, I'm always very cautious about anything that's said about the California budget until after May. So I would continue to wait and see. With respect to what the impact of a provider rate decrease would be on the health plan, I would just caution you that the company is larger than it was in 2008, and California makes up a smaller percentage of its overall business. So it probably would have a smaller effect than it would have in 2008, but there's just a lot of uncertainty about what's going to happen with California. But the only thing we really do know for sure is that the process of moving the ABD patients into managed care has begun. Letters have been going out to the beneficiaries, notifying them that they must choose a plan. And I think that, that is on track. Beyond that, I think it's too soon to really comment.
Scott Green - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay. All right, fair enough. So more color there in May I guess. So hopefully, if they get a budget passed on time maybe. And then in Georgia, you had spoken previously about working to establish networks there in preparation for an RFP that's now been delayed by at least a year. So what do you do there if you either had people on the ground or you had a network in place? Is there a cost associated with just that sitting there for a year or 2 or is there a way to lower those costs or maybe you start selling Medicare plan or something like that. What are your thoughts about that?
John Molina: What we would do is, this is John, keep efforts, I would say more than minimal less than maximum efforts to keep the network that we've got together. It doesn't cost us really much in order to keep the contracts open. And should we say that we have excess resources, we'll put them into other locations where we're trying to build and expand.
Scott Green - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay. All right. And lastly, could you talk about the sequential decrease in Washington enrollment? What drove that? I think it was down 14,000 lines sequentially.
John Molina: Sure. There are a couple of issues in Washington that are driving the enrollment decrease. One, when we moved some of the contracts off of full risk to fee-for-service, we did have some membership attrition. But that's okay. We also -- Washington in 2010 brought up a new MMIS system. We're very familiar with transitions, having gone through that in Maine and Idaho ourselves, and we think there's some issues related to the implementation of the MMIS that affected our ability to gain enrollment in Washington.
Scott Green - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay. So do you think going forward you can regain some of that or should just kind of be steady state from here?
Joseph Molina: We're working with the state on the MMIS issues.
Scott Green - BofA Merrill Lynch: All right. And then maybe one more. Are you guys looking at the Kentucky RFP at all or are you more focused on the opportunities that you outlined at Investor Day?
Joseph Molina: Well, it's always been our policy not to comment on potential RFPs. So we're not going to comment on that one.
Scott Green - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay. All right, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Carl McDonald with Citigroup.
Carl McDonald - Citigroup Inc: Thank you. First question is if you could update us on how you're feeling about the California ABD rates. I know initially the proposal from the state, a couple of the plans, thought the rates were a little bit. So anything that's changed since the initial proposal?
Terry Bayer: Well, we're in the ABD business right now. So we have our current rate. And although we've been quoted the go-forward rate, it's premature to conclude that its final in any way because of the budget issues. And again, we don't comment until we have it in hand.
Carl McDonald - Citigroup Inc: Then with this expansion, just hypothetically if the state gave you a rate that you thought was way too low for ABD, do you have to take the membership? Can we basically force it onto you or can you choose whether to participate?
Joseph White: It would be mandatory enrollment. So we would have to accept the members, yes.
Carl McDonald - Citigroup Inc: The second question is -- recognizing the comment you just made on not commenting on RFPs. I know it did, Louisiana specifically, there was some dispute over whether or not you guys would be able to bid given the existing MMIS relationship. Did you ever get conclusion on that the last time around?
Joseph Molina: Well, Carl, that's an interesting question especially in light of the fact that United [ph] owns Gen X [ph]. I find it curious that people are so concerned about our IT vendor relationship.
Carl McDonald - Citigroup Inc: But anything specific on Louisiana or. . .
Joseph Molina: No.
Carl McDonald - Citigroup Inc: And then last question is, if you could just talk about your pharmacy strategy, thinking specifically on the preterm labor drug? Now that the KB has the exclusive there, what the strategy will be?
John Molina: I don't think there's really any change in our strategy. We have about between 400 and 500 women in the 17-P program and we'll continue with that. One of the issues about this drug being exclusive, I think it's changed. We can continue to use the compounded products. So I don't think it's going to be a huge issue.
Carl McDonald - Citigroup Inc: Got it. So you're plan then is just continue to do what you've been doing?
John Molina: Yes.
Carl McDonald - Citigroup Inc: In using the compounded product?
John Molina: Correct.
Carl McDonald - Citigroup Inc: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Wright with Citadel.
Brian Wright - Citadel Securities, LLC: On taxes, what was the MLR ex the STAR+PLUS expansion in Dallas, Fort Worth?
Joseph White: Brian, it's Joe speaking. We normally don't share that level of detail. The STAR+PLUS expansion at Fort Worth, though, I will say their MCR was lightly below the number reported for Texas as whole.
Brian Wright - Citadel Securities, LLC: Okay, thanks. And then just lastly, the claims inventory was up at the end of the quarter relative to where it was a year ago and even though for the fourth quarter, and the dollar amounts are higher as well, but the days claims payable was down. Could you kind of reconcile some of those metrics?
Joseph White: This certainly isn't the first time we've had a drop in DCP coincide with an increase in claims inventory. We've also had the opposite on occasion. I think we have increased DCP with a drop in inventory. It's a rough correlation, Brian, that's all I would say. There are a lot of factors that go into our estimates that we don't know actuaries make. Everything from hospital bed days, authorized bed days, pharmacy utilization all of that. So I don't the change in inventory is particularly out of line with what we've seen in DCP. It's never been a particularly tight relationship. Brian, John was going to talk about if you also look to the roll forward table, it's rather interesting. We actually had a greater benefit from 12/31/10 in the claims roll forward table and then we did the first quarter of last year. So those two indicators are kind of pointing in opposite directions. But we're very comfortable with our reserves.
Brian Wright - Citadel Securities, LLC: Okay. And then I just don't remember and I apologize. Have you guys talked about like what the DCP number you're expecting for the year then, kind of a range or. . .
Joseph White: No, we've never really talked about that because it's too difficult to predict. It's always worth remembering days and claims payable as a product of our results and derive number from our reserves. It's not how we set our reserves.
Brian Wright - Citadel Securities, LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Lavine (sic) [Kenneth Lavine] with UBS.
Kenneth Lavine - UBS Investment Bank: Thanks for taking the questions. I have a question on the Ohio health plan. It's been pretty strong in recent periods in the last 6 months ago. I was just wondering if the MLR improvement there has kind of been notably different for the ABD population versus the DFC [ph] in the states, or if it’s pretty much been moving in tandem now?
John Molina: I think, this is John, it's been moving in tandem. Ohio is an example of where we are able to grow the business, put on a focus on medical management and get some rate increases. A combination of those 3 factors allows health plan to do very well.
Kenneth Lavine - UBS Investment Bank: Got it. And then just to circle back around the 7% decline in the hospital admissions at the end of the quarter, how does that compare to the year-over-year trend that you saw in the fourth quarter of 2010? Was the fourth quarter, was that also down in equivalent amount year-over-year?
Joseph White: I don't believe -- it's Joe speaking. I don't believe so. Fourth quarter over fourth quarter.
John Molina: The problem with the fourth quarter, when trying to compare it with the fourth quarter 2009 when we have the big spike in the flu season. Yes, it was a big blip.
Joseph White: I think it's fair to say that since the second, third quarter of last year, second half of last year, we have seen reduced inpatient utilization. I think it's been an ongoing trend. And that's 1 reason why we're confident that at least a good chunk of what's happening is driven by the efforts we've undertaken.
Kenneth Lavine - UBS Investment Bank: And what about within the first quarter? How did that -- what's the trajectory there into the quarter? Was the admissions decline perhaps greater when you were exiting March versus kind of earlier in January year-over-year?
Joseph White: I don't have that data, sorry.
Kenneth Lavine - UBS Investment Bank: That's all I have. Thanks, guys.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Charles Boorady with Credit Suisse.
Charles Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG: First question, just going back to my notes from your Investor Day. I recall you were assuming about a zero average rate increase for the year. And I'm wondering are you now revising that to say we should assume something less than zero for the full year? And if so, I'm wondering what changed.
Joseph Molina: No, Charles. We're sticking with our guidance numbers. We're not assuming that it's going to get worse. We're not assuming it's going to get better. It is what we said back in January, that continues to be our assumption.
Charles Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay. Got it. So your commentary today about conserve our state budgets, et cetera, is that any change from what you were thinking at your Investor Day?
Joseph Molina: No, I don't think so. I mean, we've been telling people for a while that we thought that the rate environment was a problem. I think that the fact that the federal government increased the FMAP for a while pushed the issue out a little bit. But it continues to be a concern. And it's one of the things we want people to understand. It's a big risk for us.
Charles Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG: Got it. So basically no change in your thinking for an expected roughly zero average price increase for the full year? In your commentary today, is it basically, are you seeing anything different from what you were seeing then? Are you giving us a bias towards a potential cut in rates based on what you're seeing so far? You said something about nothing prevents states from adjusting rates downward during a contract period.
Joseph Molina: No. Charles, the reason I was saying those things, I think that there's some misconception about our industry. You hear people say things like are the rates locked in? Rates are never locked in with state governments. They give us a rate and in the vast majority of cases, that rate doesn't change throughout the course of the year. But there have been times when rates have changed. I think a good example of that was the successive rate decreases we saw in Wisconsin. It's unusual, but it's not unheard of. I don't want people to take away from our discussions the notion that rates are absolutely locked in or carved in stone. And this is a significant rate factor for us this year because of the state budget problems. But I don't think it's really any different than what we talked about in January. I think we signaled in January that we weren't expecting much in the way of rate increases. And if you look at our results for the first quarter, premium rate increases were up 1%. That's not very much, especially given the historic numbers that we've had which have been in the low single digits.
Charles Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG: Yes, I appreciate that. I guess the comment around states potentially adjusting rates downward during a contract period, I mean given the state budget challenges this year and given that medical trends were a lot weaker than expected last year, is it more reasonable to maybe assume as a base case that the rates might get cut or do you think that's unlikely to happen and that no increase or decrease is the best expected case for the year?
John Molina: Charles, we're going to stick by the rate schedule that we put out in January. I think the comments that we have today really are reflective of -- we don't want our business to be solely dependent on states giving us or taking away rates. We are managing our business based on the available revenue stream we've got. And that's keeping our imminent costs in line with our expectations that's working on utilization and that's contracting efforts and diversification into things like MMS. We don't want the whole discussions to be about what our rate increase is because frankly, it sort of abdicates our profitably to the states. The states may go back and change rates when they get into financial problems as Mario has said. However, they're still bound by actuarial soundness. And Congress and CMS are looking at that whole process right now by putting some more teeth into the oversight.
Charles Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG: Got it. That's helpful added color. Thank you. The next question on free cash apparent, just to make sure I got this right, it's $25.6 million versus $65 million in the fourth quarter. And I'm wondering if that's correct and what the drop related to.
Joseph White: It's Joe speaking. A lot of that is essentially just timing of cash flows. We have our weep in the first quarter. We pay out our 2010 incentive comp accrual. We also have to ensure that we have adequate statutory net worth in states like Wisconsin, where we're going to take that premium deficiency reserve. Obviously that diminished our network considerably. So obviously, it's a combination of normal ebbs and flows of cash and the need to fund Wisconsin in particular.
Charles Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG: Got it. And then in Texas, I think you might have answered this. The MLR of 91 1, which is up quite a bit sequentially. Was that mainly new ABD lives added?
Joseph White: I think as I said on the call, we don't go into that detail, but I can tell you that the Dallas-Fort Worth MCR was something less than the consolidated Texas number.
Charles Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG: Got it. And then just finally, on the sequential enrollments dropping just by a little bit. In Michigan by a couple of thousand, in Washington 14,000, New Mexico by about 1,000. Was there a common thread there, maybe eligibility going down as employment picks up or any way to explain those changes?
John Molina: I think part of that in Michigan is exactly that about the population of the state, and in particular in Detroit, eligibility is going down.
Charles Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG: Got it. And in Washington state, anything unusual?
Joseph Molina: Well, we already talked about Washington. I think there were a number of issues. One of them had to do with some of the changes in the provider contracts and the other is an issue on the MMIS side, which we think is affecting eligibility. We've informed the state and we're working with them to straighten out the eligibility issues in Washington.
Charles Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay, got it. Yes, I did get those comments. So that explained that drop. In future expectations, did we already see the full impact of that or should we expect continued erosion there?
Joseph Molina: No, I don't expect continued erosion in Washington.
Charles Boorady - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: We have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to you, Mr. Orellana.
Juan Jose Orellana: Thank you, all. Thanks everyone for joining us today. We'll talk to you second quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We thank you all for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Molina Healthcare Year-End 2010 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Juan José Orellana, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan José Orellana: Thank you, Kevin. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare's financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2010. The company's earnings release reporting its results was issued today after the market closed and is now posted for viewing on our company website. On the call with me today are Dr. Mario Molina, our Chief Executive Officer; John Molina, our CFO; Terry Bayer, our COO; and Joseph White, our Chief Accounting Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. Our comments today will contain forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, including statements regarding our guidance for 2011. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K annual report, our Form 10-Q quarterly reports and our Form 8-K current reports. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab of our company website or on the SEC's website. All of the forward-looking statements made during today's call represent our judgment as of February 17, 2011, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements. This call is being recorded and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available over the Internet through the company's website at molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina.
Joseph Molina: Thank you, Juan José. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. It has been just three weeks since we provided a comprehensive review of our business and operations at our Investor Day in New York City. Therefore, I will keep my remarks brief so that John can review some of the financial highlights for the quarter and the year and then open the call for your questions.  2010 was a very good year for Molina Healthcare. We achieved strong financial results and great operational execution. We grew revenue in enrollment, increased our EBITDA, as well as our net income, and continue to generate strong operating cash flow. It was also a very strong year for Molina strategically as we invested in our future by entering the Medicaid information or Fiscal Agent business through our acquisition from Unisys of its Health Information Management business. We now operate that business under the name Molina Medicaid Solutions. This acquisition provides another platform for growth to compliment the growth that is expected in our Medicaid Health Plan business over the next few years. I'm pleased about the direction we have chosen and about the breadth and depth of the services portfolio that we are now bringing to the Medicaid market. Moving onto our results. The fourth quarter was better than anticipated and it was consistent with the trends we shared with you at our Investor Day. The general operational performance and cash flow at our Health Plans was strong, led by our four largest Health Plans: California, Michigan, Ohio, and Washington. Of course, there are always challenges, particularly in new markets. In Florida, for example, medical costs remain volatile and elevated. As Terry pointed out in our Investor Day, the volatility in the medical care ratio at this health plan is caused in part by its low membership. Florida's one of our newest markets and has considerably lower enrollment than our more mature health plans. The issues we faced in Florida are some of the same issues we faced during the beginning stages of operations of our Ohio Health Plan. We are implementing in Florida some of the same initiatives that helped lower medical costs in Ohio. Our Wisconsin Health Plan faced the similar issues. Wisconsin is our newest health plan and with only 36,000 members, it is even smaller than our Florida Health Plan. There are still many opportunities to grow our market share in Wisconsin as the Health Plan market remains fragmented. As we experienced in Michigan, fragmentation can provide some in-state acquisition opportunities or may force less efficient competitors out of the market. Speaking of new markets, Molina Medicaid Solutions contributed about $3 million in operating income since we acquired the business on May 1, 2010. However, the unit reported an operating loss of about $4 million in the fourth quarter. The operating loss for the fourth quarter was a result of system stabilization costs in Idaho and Maine. We continue to make progress in these states and have also begun to work on re-procurements in Louisiana and West Virginia. I'm also pleased to announce that in addition to Norm Nichols' appointment as President of Molina Medicaid Solutions, Dr. Jim Howatt, who has been serving as Chief Medical Officer for the Molina Health Plans, will be transitioning to a new role as Medical Director for Molina Medicaid Solutions. As the MMS Medical Director, Dr. Howatt will serve as the clinical leader for existing and future MMS product offerings, and will work closely with Norm to incorporate coordination solutions into the government healthcare programs served by MMS. Now, I'd like to turn your attention to Texas. As of this moment, the state of Texas has yet to release the final RFP. We remain optimistic about the opportunity to increase our market share in Texas. The successful implementation of our new contracts with the Texas CHIP Rural Service Area program and the Dallas STAR+PLUS program provide us with additional momentum in Texas.  Implementation of the CHIP program resulted in a membership gain of nearly 54,000 new members in September of 2010. Our contract for the Dallas STAR+PLUS program for ABD beneficiaries effective on February 1, 2011, contributed nearly 32,000 additional ABD members. We continue to focus on quality. In the first quarter of 2010, Molina Healthcare of Florida earned a quality accreditation from the National Committee on Quality Assurance or NCQA. This brings the number of Molina Healthcare Plans that are accredited by NCQA to eight. To our knowledge, there is no other Medicaid Health Plan organization in the country with this many NCQA accreditations as Molina Healthcare. Organizations that want to participate in the new state healthcare insurance exchanges in 2014 will need to have some form of accreditation.  Looking into 2011. We expect to continue investing in the business as we pursue growth opportunities, as well as continue to build on our momentum and the financial achievements in 2010. Demonstrating healthcare value to our members, our providers and the government agencies with which we contract will remain one of our top priorities. Now, I would like to turn the call over to John.
John Molina: Thank you, Mario, and good afternoon or evening to everyone. As Mario pointed out, this was a very good quarter and a very good past year for Molina Healthcare.  In addition to the fourth quarter and year-end results we are releasing today, there are only a few updates beyond what we have disclosed at our Investor Day on January 26. I encourage you to view that investor presentation as it provides a great update our business, our outlook for 2011 and a first glimpse at our outlook for 2012.  Let me review today's results. Net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2010, was approximately $18 million or $0.58 per diluted share compared with a loss of $5 million or $0.18 per diluted share for the same period last year. Net income for the full year was $55 million or $1.98 per diluted share, compared with net income of $31 million or $1.19 per diluted share for 2009. 2010 was a year of accomplishment and growth at Molina as evidenced by our results today. In addition to our financial objectives, we remain committed to meeting the needs of our members and the government programs that serve them. Premium revenue for the fourth quarter was $1 billion, up $80 million or approximately 8% from the fourth quarter of 2009. For all of 2010, premium revenues increased by $330 million or 9% to $4 billion. This revenue increase is primarily due to our membership growth and not because of premium rate increases. As we discussed previously, Medicaid rate increases have been minimal and are expected to remain low. Please refer back to our January Investor Day presentation where we detailed our expectations for state-by-state premium rate changes. We view EBITDA, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as an excellent metric to assess business performance. EBITDA grew in 2010 by $76 million or 84% when compared to 2009. The reconciliation to GAAP financial measures and the methodology behind the EBITDA calculation can be found on Page 8 of our earnings release. Lower interest rates remain a substantial drag on our net income. Investment income decreased to $6 million in 2010 compared with $9 million in 2009. That decrease alone reduced EPS by almost $0.07 when compared to 2009. Our medical care ratio decreased to 82.7% in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to 87.5% in the fourth quarter of 2009. This is mainly due to lower fee-for-service costs. For all of 2010, our medical care ratio decreased to 84.5% compared to 86.8% in 2009. The H1N1 flu epidemic had a marked impact on our 2009 medical care costs. The flu had little impact on our 2010 fourth quarter results. But it is still too early to comment on its impact on the first quarter of 2011. General and administrative expenses grew to 9.3% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with 8% of total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2009. This increase is the result of higher administrative expenses for the Health Plans segment, driven in part by the cost of the company's Medicare operations where enrollment more than doubled between the end of 2009 and the end of 2010, higher compensation expense as a result of substantially improved financial performance in 2010 and the acquisition of Molina Medicaid Solutions. Days and claims payable in the fourth quarter were 42 days, which was flat on a sequential basis compared to the third quarter. Positive operating cash flow for 2010 was $162 million for the year and $153 million for the quarter. The company had cash and investments of approximately $814 million including restricted investments. Our parent company had free cash and investments of approximately $65 million. Moving on to guidance. We are reaffirming our guidance discussed at our Investor Day on January 26, 2011. A complete discussion of our assumptions and risk factors can be found in our Investor Day presentation available on our website.  Finally, at our Investor Day back in September of 2007, we shared with you some of our long-term goals. Those goals included achieving revenues of $4 billion by the end of 2010, growing our ABD enrollment, growing our Medicare enrollment and providing healthcare services on a fee basis. I'm happy to report that we've achieved all of these goals. Our 2010 revenues have indeed reached $4 billion. Our ABD enrollment has grown to 150,000 members and our Medicare enrollment has grown to more than 24,000 members. Finally, our acquisition and launch of the Molina Medicaid Solutions business has marked our entry into providing services on a fee basis. At Molina, we continue to articulate and manage and then achieve long-term strategic goals.  This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of a Josh Raskin with Barclays Capital.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital: First question, I guess, on Florida. I know new state, low membership and you had talked about some of the corrective actions. And clearly, we're asking the same exact questions about Ohio and we see the improvements. So I'm just curious, do you have sort of an expectation for a Florida MLR or even a timing as to when you would see at least a more normalized MLR range?
John Molina: I think our target, Josh, is less. I don't mean to be funny but with a small amount, it's volatile. So we would expect as we continue to grow the business, continue to gain some scale in the market. We can continue to drive better provider contracts. We are closer with our providers to work on utilization and bring it down. It's going to be a function in large part on how well and fast we can grow the business and then also if there's any rate changes -- positive rate changes that the state gives us. I think last year, as you may recall, we had slight decrease in the rates.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital: 95%, that's not sustainable. You guys can't sort of run that forever. So at what point do you guys think about, okay, we don't have scale. We need to either increase scale or exit the market or start thinking more serious. I mean, is it one-rate cycle? Is it two-rate cycle? How should we think about Florida?
Joseph Molina: Joshua, I think you think about Florida the way we think about Ohio. It's an important state for us to be in. It took us a while to get the medical cost down in Ohio. But clearly, from a strategic standpoint, it was the right thing to do. And I think that, strategically, it's important for us to be in the Florida market. So we're going to continue to work on bringing those costs down and to grow our enrollment.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital: Second question is on the MMS. Could you maybe help us with the seasonality of earnings, sort of quarterly earnings for that book of business that, obviously, it hasn't been on -- 2010 wasn't a normal year, sort of at the top [ph] and we didn't see first quarter last year. So how should we think about the earnings contribution from MMS next year?
Joseph White: Hi, Josh. It's Joe speaking. We have not observed notably any kind of seasonality in the MMS business the way you would observe seasonality in our HMO business. Obviously, at some times of the year, you can have more claims and others. But we don't see anything that pronounced. What we have talked about though is with the new contracts in Maine and particularly Idaho, the timing of the start in revenue recognition. So once Maine had begun revenue recognition in 2010, once Idaho begins revenue recognition in 2011, you're going to see an increase in earnings. And that's one reason why if you'll recall back in New York, when we spoke to what we call seasonality of earnings, it was loaded toward the back end.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital: Would you give us some revenue targets for the second half versus the first half...
Joseph White: Yes.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital: The tax rate was a little bit higher than we'd expected. Was there anything in it? Was it just more income or is it higher state, higher tax state? Or was there anything else to it?
John Molina: I would just express it as just the usual end of the year true ups in terms of credits we thought we could take versus credits we thought we could have gotten deductible expenses, nondeductible expenses. Nothing unusual.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehana.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Obviously, a very strong cash flow quarter here and some fairly sizable changes in working capital. I was wondering if you could highlight some of the moving parts there? And what led to the significant changes sequentially?
Joseph White: It's Joe speaking again. I think, Chris, the biggest issue out there is simply California catching up on their premium payments in the fourth quarter. You'll recall in the third quarter, we had very bad cash flow because California had its budget crisis, in which delayed payment. So the simplest matter is just California catching up.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: You've seen some states apply for waivers to reduce eligibility. Arizona is one state in particular. At this point in time, do you view any of the moving parts in the states around the nation as having a material impact on you guys in terms of eligibility reduction?
Joseph Molina: Hi, this is Mario. Chris, I would say no at this point.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: I guess -- did you guys have any sense for Georgia? And when we might have an update out of the state with regard to their RFP?
Joseph Molina: Again, this is Mario, and the answer is also no.
Operator: The next question comes from the line Tom Carroll with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Thomas Carroll: Question on Ohio. Very large decrease in the MLR year-over-year and I read your prepared comments in the press release. But I was wondering if you could give us a bit more color out there on the 13 percentage point decline in MLR. And then secondly, just again on the MMS business, I wonder if you could elaborate on what system stabilization costs are and if you expect them to continue into kind of first quarter of this year?
John Molina: Tom, I'll take the second question first. I think we are still doing stabilization for Idaho to a lesser extent, Maine, but it is continuing on. I think that Joe talked about this in New York that we thought would trail off towards the end of the second quarter, should be over with. As far as Ohio goes, it's a combination of a lot of hard work getting the provider contracts in place and utilization, especially ER utilization down in Ohio combined with we did get a rate increase that helped.
Joseph Molina: And this is Mario. Let me just add that I think another thing that helped us year-over-year has been the absence of H1N1 flu epidemic, which did have an adverse effect on our medical costs across the board last year in all the states.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of John Rex with JP Morgan.
John Rex - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Just on G&A. So I think with the Health Plan segment administrative, that line item is $72 million -- $70 million line item that was up $15 million sequentially. How much of that -- was that mostly incentive comp? I'm trying to think about kind of a run rate going forward and kind of how that was impacted by the incentive comp accruals.
Joseph White: It's Joe speaking. If you look back to the guidance we put out in New York, I think we said approximately 8.4% going forward. And that's what we are anticipating going forward end of the year. So what you've seen this quarter was essentially an anomaly.
John Rex - JP Morgan Chase & Co: So what was the $15 million sequential increase?
John Molina: Certainly, incentive comp was a big piece of it.
John Rex - JP Morgan Chase & Co: So incentive comp, like what percentage of that would it be?
John Molina: I don't really want to go into that in this call right here. It's a substantial portion of it as where acquisition costs with Abri and the typical year-end cost of Medicare where we have the open enrollment preparation where we're putting out open enrollment materials and that kind of thing.
John Rex - JP Morgan Chase & Co: So those are not that the Medicare line item you have up above, that doesn't encompass that? The $9 million?
Joseph Molina: It would encompass that.
John Molina: Yes, it would.
John Rex - JP Morgan Chase & Co: So that's not part of the $15 million? I was just trying to understand the $15 million sequential move. And I guess I come away of still not understanding. Is it just incentive comp? Should we just assume that's it?
John Molina: I would assume that, that's it. As Joe said, we did have issues related to the Abri acquisition and integration. And also, there's probably some spill around the MMS side because we're not quite as adept as we'd like to be in segregating those costs. So for example, as we're moving payroll over from MMS to the Molina system, those costs are probably just going to be buried in the Health Plans segment because that's where most of the growth of the corporate folks are.
John Rex - JP Morgan Chase & Co: If we think about January, any trends you're seeing in the claims runs data that you've been seeing so far that suggest kind of different trend that you saw in the 4Q? Or is it more the same?
John Molina: I think that it's really too early to comment much on January or 2011 in general. We did put out our guidance a couple, three weeks ago. And as of right now, we're sticking by it.
John Rex - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And just so I understand that, does that mean you don't really have a view on January claims runs? Or what you have seen wouldn't just be kind of in line with how you guided?
Joseph Molina: Well, John, we're here to talk about 2010 fourth quarter and year end. I really don't want to get into 2011 at this point.
John Rex - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Why not?
Joseph White: [Indiscernible] It's fair to say I don't think I've ever seen a January that told what the story was going to be for the year, positive or negative.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line Carl McDonald with Citigroup.
Carl McDonald - Citigroup Inc: Just a little bit of give-and-take between the state of California and the plans on what the rates will be for the age, blind, disabled expansion. Does that put the -- thoughts you're thinking of sort of the mid-year timeframe on the extension there. Does that put that at risk or is that still on track at this point?
John Molina: As far as we know, the enrollment is still on track.
Carl McDonald - Citigroup Inc: And the 12,000 runs that you talked about, is the expectation that will come on a specific date? Or is it that it comes in sort of on a monthly rolling basis?
John Molina: Monthly rolling basis.
Carl McDonald - Citigroup Inc: The West Virginia RFP that you mentioned you're working on, is that for a Health Plan or is that MMIS?
John Molina: MMIS.
Operator: We do have a question from the line of Scott Green with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Scott Green - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: First, just thinking about the MLR overall. It doesn't look like there was much prior period development in the period. And so now, the 2011, MLR guidance is supposed to be up 210 basis points from a 4Q jumping off point. And so I was curious, would you highlight maybe any sort of intra-year favorable development that would cause some of the run rate MLRs you reported in the fourth quarter to not really be reflective of a run rate?
John Molina: I think that the fourth quarter MLR was probably more affected by a lack of flu season as compared to 2009 and is indicative of a trend going forward. So I think as Mario said, we did benefit from a light flu season that was virtually no H1N1. And at some point, we're going to see an uptick in utilization because there's going to be a flu season coming back.
Scott Green - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: But X flu, would there be any sort of seasonality between third quarter and fourth quarter?
John Molina: Third quarter tends to be our lowest MCR and fourth quarter starts to tick back up. And historically, the first quarter then, the medical costs continue to rise from fourth quarter and then start heading back down in the second quarter. So we are sort of following historical pattern here.
Joseph White: It's Joe speaking. I think the point about 2011 too is, bear in mind, we've talked about the ABD life in Texas and California. We expect those to run a little bit higher than our traditional consolidated medical care ratio. We talked about that in New York. We're also going to have the full impact of the year at Wisconsin, which you can see from these results, it's also running higher than consolidated MCR. So I think expectations for 2011 are a combination of mix and anticipation of a less favorable flu season at the highest level.
Scott Green - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: On Ohio, you're about to get a rate increase January 1, is that right? You're talking about rate increase but normally, Ohio rates are effective 1/1. Is that still how it is here?
John Molina: That's correct. And if you go back to the presentation we did in New York couple of weeks ago, we have Ohio at about 4%, 4.5% effective January 1.
Scott Green - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: And then in the news I saw today, Michigan Governor Snyder proposed, integrating around 250,000 dual eligibles to managed care. And I was curious if what your thoughts are if there is support for an initiative like that in Michigan? And any idea what PMPM could be?
Joseph Molina: Well, this is Mario. We've always advocated for the inclusion of the age, blind and disabled population in managed care. So we're certainly supportive of it. We think that this is a group that particularly benefits from the kinds of care management that can be applied to managed care programs. Whether it will come to pass or not, it's, I think, too early to say. But we're certainly supportive of it. These are dual eligibles and as you know, we have contracts in a number of states for the special needs plans to enroll dual eligibles through our Medicare and Medicaid contracts. So we're completely supportive.
Scott Green - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Are there any other discussions that you're having with other states that were not on your growth drivers that you outlined at Investor Day but one of your core markets like Ohio or any other states like that, that might be more in advanced stage considerating moving more lives over?
Joseph Molina: Well, let me say this. I think that the message we give to states is all pretty much the same. We want to see the care integrated as much as possible. We want to include the elderly and the disabled beneficiaries. We want to bring in behavioral health and pharmacy benefits where possible because we think that the more that we can coordinate, the better off it is for the beneficiaries and the better it's going to be for the state budgets. So I think we are consistent in our message with all the states.
Scott Green - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: And then one last one, if I may, in Florida, where there favorable benefits from provider recontracting in this quarter that were offset by even higher costs? Or have the provider recontracting efforts not flowed through yet to your MLR?
Terry Bayer: This is Terry Bayer. The recontracting efforts in Florida is ongoing. And late last year, we got some traction on unit cost reduction that's just rolling and continuing to flow.
Joseph White: If I could just add to that. I think though in terms of setting reverse at the end of the year, while we know we have some favorable contracts in place or approved, I don't think you're going to see the benefit of that in the fourth quarter.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We have no further questions from the phone at the moment.
Joseph Molina: Well, that being the case, I just want to say it's been a very good year for Molina Healthcare and it couldn't have happened without the cooperation of all of our staff. So I just want to publicly acknowledge and thank everyone for their hard work over the past year. And we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Molina Healthcare’s third quarter 2010 conference call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions) As a reminder this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, October 26, 2010. I would like to turn the conference over to Juan José Orellana, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Juan José Orellana: Thank you, Edison. Hello everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare’s financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2010.

I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina.
Mario Molina: Thank you, Juan José, and hello everyone. Our remarks today will be brief, since we provided a comprehensive overview of our business at our Investor Day on September 14. Results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2010 were $0.57 per diluted share. Today’s results reflect the continuing momentum of the strategic and operational initiatives that we outlined during our second quarter earnings call and our Investor Day. There are some key developments that contributed to our success this quarter that I would like to highlight. Premium revenues increased in the third quarter as a result of greater enrolment and premium rate increases in some of our states. But they were flat on a per member per month basis compared to 2009. However, medical cost decreased by $5.49 per member per month from the same period last year leading to higher margins. The biggest declines in medical costs were in our large states, California, Washington and Ohio, which were partially offset by increasing medical costs in New Mexico, Michigan, and Missouri. Let me talk about these developments in greater detail starting with enrolment. Our Wisconsin acquisition and our new CHIP contract in Texas provided most of our enrolment growth in the quarter. Our enrolment in Wisconsin was approximately 28,000, nearly 10,000 more members than when we announced the acquisition of the health plan in July. The health plan has the potential to grow even more from the third open enrolment period, which ended in mid-October. We added 54,000 members under our Rural CHIP contract in Texas effective September 1. The new members represent over 40% of the addressable market in the CHIP program. Our involvement in this program complements our existing operation in Texas Star and Star Plus Medicaid programs. Premium rate increases in Florida, Utah and Washington were enough to offset rate decreases in Missouri and New Mexico during the quarter. The rate increases in Utah and Washington became effective on July 1. So our results reflect a full quarter of the benefit. Florida rates, on the other hand, became effective on September 1. Increases in some states and decreases in others confirm how volatile premium rates can be, and highlight the variation in premium rates that we experience in the States in which we operate. We expect this pattern to continue into 2011. Higher medical margin combined with enrolment growth have been the keys to greater profitability. Compared to last year, we have seen very little flu activity, and the various contracting and medical management initiatives we have implemented resulted in lower medical costs this year. However, we want to remind everyone that last year the H1N1 flu peaked in late October, and that typically the flu season peaks between December and April. If flu activity in the fourth quarter is similar to levels observed last year that would present a significant challenge for us in the fourth quarter. The California health plan is performing better than last year. Where we were unable to agree with providers on appropriate fees, we terminated those contracts. We exited the AIM program because premium rates were inadequate. And we left Old Oak [ph] County, where we lacked the scale to support an efficient operation. California enacted its budget about three weeks ago, and there were two specific provisions that may benefit our California health plan. First, the budget includes an increase of $174 million to provide an estimated 3.7% rate increase to Medicaid managed care plans in the state. We view this as a good sign. The proposed rate increase would take into consideration a pharmacy pricing adjustment, and should be actuarially sound as required by Federal law. As a reminder, the 3.7% increase is an aggregate number. The actual rate increase, specific to each health plan, will be based on a number of factors. New rates in California for Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties go into effect retroactive to October 1, 2010 and on January 1, 2011 for San Diego and Sacramento counties. The second key budget provision transitions the age, blind and disabled beneficiaries from fee for service to managed care programs starting in June 2011. Currently, there are close to 380,000 ABD beneficiaries in the state that will be served by managed care. In the counties in which Molina operates, about 260,000 ABD beneficiaries will be served by managed care. Our involvement in this expansion will greatly complement our existing participation with ABD patients in California, and help us to build additional scale and expertise in arranging medical care for this population. As of September 30, our California plan cared for 13,500 ABD members in the state, but our consolidated ABD enrolment was 120,000 members, representing about 8% of our total membership. We have often discussed the strategic value of the California health plan, even when rates and medical cost trends were not favorable. The ABD managed care expansion is a case in point. By participating in California, the largest Medicaid market in the country, Molina is well positioned to benefit from additional managed care expansions in the state, as well as healthcare reform in the not too distant future. Switching to Molina Medicaid solutions, our fiscal agent business, we continue to make progress in the implementation of our system in Idaho, which began operations on June 1, only a month after we closed the acquisition from Unisys. When the transaction closed, Idaho was already nearing the end of its design, development and implementation phase and there was little we could do to influence the implementation. Therefore, it is no surprise that we encountered a few challenges. We are fully engaged with the state of Idaho, have supplemented the operation with additional resources, and are working with both the state and local providers to address the issues that have risen since June 1. In contrast, the main system went live on September 1 and has encountered fewer problems then we experienced in Idaho. Early indications over the past few weeks are that the system is working without major problems, and issues that did arise are being addressed. We have, however incurred greater cost after the system implementation than we had anticipated. As a result, the financial performance of the MMS segment was less favorable in the third quarter than we had anticipated. The state of Maine has been operating without a CMS certified MMIS system for the past five years. We are eager to assist the state of Maine in achieving its CMS certification. I would like to point out that the implementation of an MMIS is both an art and a science that consists of planning, implementation, training and ongoing maintenance. No two implementations are the same. Timelines are adjusted and changes are always needed to meet evolving customer requirements. This is something that is not new to the MMIS industry, but may be disconcerting for those who have not followed the MMIS space and are new to the industry. Our strategy for Molina Medicaid solutions, which we have shared with you in the past, is to pursue fiscal agent contracts in states with smaller Medicaid programs, where managed care is unlikely to reach a meaningful scale. We see a robust pipeline of opportunities to bid on new contracts over the next three years, as states seek to procure new Medicaid information systems to deal with issues related to the new ICD-10 classification system, and other requirements coming out of the healthcare reform legislation. I’m pleased with the results of the quarter, and convinced that we are well positioned to thrive in a rapidly changing marketplace thanks to progress we have made and continue to make across all of our operations. I will now turn the call over to John.
John Molina: Thank you, Mario. We are very pleased with our results this quarter. Earnings per diluted share for the quarter was $0.57, up over 70% from a year ago. And we achieved this level of performance despite employee severance and settlement costs that reduced EPS by $0.10. Net income was up $8 million or 89% over last year. EBITDA was up over 87% from last year. As we have discussed, EBITDA is a very important measurement, as it provides us with a better operational metric, by which we can assess the performance of our business. Operating revenue for the quarter was $1 billion, up $123 million or approximately 13% from the third quarter in 2009. I would like to point out that our Investor Day in September 2007, we communicated our goal of reaching $4 billion in revenues by the end of 2010. Today’s financial results confirm that we are on track for meeting that goal. The primary drivers of revenue growth this quarter was enrolment, both in Medicaid and in Medicare. Our Medicaid enrolment grew by 97,000 members. That is 6.5% sequentially, and by 174,000 members, or 12.4% over the third quarter of 2009. In the third quarter, the growth in enrolment can be mainly attributed to the transition of members from Abri Health Plan in Wisconsin and from the Rural CHIP contract in Texas. However, the company has experienced solid organic enrolment growth this year. At our Investor Day in January, we estimated that enrolment would grow overall by approximately 7% in 2010. But for the first nine months of the year, we have grown by 131,000 members or approximately 9% in Medicaid alone. Growth in Medicare enrolment has been equally dramatic. Our Medicare enrolment grew by 22,000 [ph] members, more than 11% sequentially and by 12,500 members or 124% over the third quarter of 2009. We now serve a total of approximately 23,000 Medicare members. We have been steadily growing our enrollment of dual eligible beneficiaries in multiple states, and look forward to building additional scale in this business. In the past, we have told investors that we expected Medicaid premium rate increases to be in the low single digits. So far, 2010 is proving us to be correct. If we remove the effects of the carve out of pharmacy benefits in Ohio and Missouri, and adjust for our increasing Medicare enrolment, Medicaid premium growth, PMPM, was approximately 3% in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the third quarter of 2009, and about 2% when we compare the nine months ended September 30, 2010 to the same period in 2009. We have made the most of these premium increases by better managing our medical costs. Our medical care ratio declined by nearly 250 basis points year-over-year and 180 basis points on a sequential basis. Mario touched on some of our medical management initiatives that resulted in lower medical costs, including recontracting and exiting product lines in some markets. In addition, other items that contributed to lower medical costs in the quarter included lower inpatient utilization and a less severe flu season so far in 2010. General and administrative expenses were $89 million, or 8.5% of total revenue, compared with $69 million, or 7.5% of total revenue, for the same quarter last year. The main reason for the increase in G&A was the one time employee severance and settlement costs of approximately $4.7 million for the quarter. Absent those costs, G&A expenses would have been 8.1% of total revenue. Cash flow from operating activities was $8 million for the first nine months of 2010 compared with $130 million for the first nine months of 2009. There are two factors that explain the change between years. Both of these factors relate entirely to the timing of receipt of premiums. The first factor relates to Ohio. In Ohio, deferred revenue, which was a source of operating cash, totaling $61 million in 2009 became a use of cash in the amount of $64 million in 2010. Simply put, the state of Ohio used to pay us prior to the start of the month of service, but beginning in 2010 has moved payment to the month of service. The second factor relates to California. As Mario discussed in his remarks, the state budget was delayed. This resulted in a $65 million increase in the California health plan receivable as of September 30, 2010. As of today, we have received most of the amounts owed to us. As we have often said, we believe that over time operating cash flow will equal net income plus depreciation and amortization. The company has cash and investments and restricted investments of approximately $687 million. The parent company had unrestricted cash and investments of approximately $50 million. Days in claims payable for fee for service costs this quarter was 42 days, down two days from the previous quarter. I would like to call your attention to the row 4 [ph] table presented in our earnings release, which demonstrates consistent favorable development over the measured time segments. As a reminder, the company completed an offering of its common stock in August. Including the over-allotment, the company sold 4,350,000 shares raising approximately $112 million net of underwriting fees. The funds raised by the offerings were used to pay off the outstanding balance on the facility. By paying off our debt, we gained greater flexibility for investing in strategic acquisitions like Abri and Molina Medicaid solutions and other initiatives that will make our company stronger. As a reminder, the sale of primary shares raised the number of diluted shares outstanding to 28.4 million for the third quarter. Now let me address guidance. Given the inherent and acknowledged volatility of our business, it has not been our practice to provide quarterly guidance. We see there is little benefit in trying to pinpoint quarterly earnings, which can be influenced by a myriad of factors. We balance that with our belief that transparency is key to success of shareholder relations. Therefore, when material factors arise from time to time, we may adjust annual earnings guidance. This is just such a time. The company believes that the following factors have been most influential in changing its earnings outlook since guidance was last issued. Our better than anticipated performance during the third quarter of 2010, lower medical utilization at most of our health plans, rate decreases in New Mexico effective November 1, 2010, higher than anticipated stabilization costs in our MMS segment for the first few months after the system went live. Therefore the company is adjusting its full-year guidance for fiscal year 2010 previously issued on September 13. The revised guidance for fiscal year 2010 is now $1.90 per diluted share. The most recently issued guidance for fiscal year 2010 was approximately $1.70 per diluted share. Other financial metrics that investors may want to incorporate into their financial models are included in our earnings release. Edison, that concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Joshua Raskin from Barclays Capital. Please proceed.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays Capital: Hi, thanks, good afternoon. I guess the first question just – it seems to have been a very good month since we last spoke, and when you gave guidance mid-September. So I'm just curious. A 50 basis points overall full-year improvement in the MLR seems pretty dramatic for sort of one month of claims data. So I'm just curious if you could help us understand what caused that magnitude of improvement since you last gave guidance.
John Molina: Joshua, it is John. Actually it was too much, because when we did our Investor Day, it was mid-September. So September we actually didn’t have August claims run out yet. So, I think also when we did the guidance at the last Investor Day, we were also assuming that the flu would come in to a greater extent than it has, and last, I think that we are gaining some confidence in the medical management efforts that we put in place last year. It takes a while for us to develop and see the trends. We just don’t want to run off a couple of data points.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays Capital: Okay. That's fair. I didn't realize you hadn't included September. I guess the second question – flu for fourth quarter. What do you have in terms of expectations? Is it a normal flu season or are you now assuming similar to what we've been seeing in terms of trends?
Mario Molina: Hi Josh, this is Mario. We are assuming that it is going to be a more typical flu season this year.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays Capital: Okay, so it's picking up, but not necessarily what we saw last year?
Mario Molina: No, not what we saw last year. Last year was very unusual.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays Capital: Okay. And then, just a last question on the California ABD opportunity, maybe you could tell us a little bit about how you expect that to work in terms of membership allocated to plan, where you think the PMPMs could range, and how you guys think about your expected share.
Mario Molina: Well, this is Mario again. I think that it will roll out in a similar fashion to what we are seeing with the TANF, so the members will be given a choice of plans, and those that don’t make a selection within a given timeframe will be assigned to a plan. I think the assignment algorithms are going to be similar to what we have seen in the past in California.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays Capital: Could you talk a little bit about maybe the revenue opportunity, and how many plans you'd expect to participate and how they're sort of choosing that?
Mario Molina: Well, it will be the current plans that are involved in the Medicare managed care program. So it will vary from county to county, and I think that the revenue opportunity you can probably assume that we will get our pro rata share of the market. We like to get more than that, but I think for modeling purposes, I think you can assume that the ABD market share will be similar to the TANF market share.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays Capital: Okay. And then PMPMs for ABD – obviously, at California TANF I guess is a little bit lower than national TANF averages. Is the ABD similar? Have you guys seen trend data on that?
John Molina: Josh, there haven’t released the rates yet. This is John. They haven’t released the rates yet under the new program, but currently we are getting somewhere between $300 and $400 for the ABD.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays Capital: Okay. Perfect.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna. Please proceed.
Chris Rigg – Susquehanna Financial Group: Good morning guys. Obviously fairly strong performance across the board, but the one state that did stand out was Washington. I was wondering if you could give us a sense, when you talk about reduced fee-for-service costs, are you talking more just reduced utilization, or absolute sort of payment cuts that you are paying the providers.
John Molina: This is John. It is reduced utilization. We are not cutting provider fees.
Chris Rigg – Susquehanna Financial Group: Okay. And then – but what exactly are in the severance and settlement costs?
John Molina: There are settlement and severance costs. We don’t discuss personal matters beyond that.
Chris Rigg – Susquehanna Financial Group: Okay. But it wasn't – was it a group of layoffs, or just some –?
Mario Molina: It reflects the number of employees that were laid off from the company.
Chris Rigg – Susquehanna Financial Group: Okay. And then you guys also commented with regard to Wisconsin, and I think I missed it, but you had mentioned something regarding enrollment growth in mid-October. Could you give us some color as to what you were talking about there?
Mario Molina: Yes, this is Mario. The last open enrolment period ended in mid-October. So we don’t yet have the final numbers from that, but we should be seeing that shortly and we think that there is an opportunity for continued growth in that last segment of the open enrolment period.
Chris Rigg – Susquehanna Financial Group: Okay. Could you guys share what you're sort of near to intermediate term expectations are for Wisconsin, in terms of where you think you could be?
John Molina: Somewhere between 30,000 and 40,000 probably we will end up.
Chris Rigg – Susquehanna Financial Group: Okay. And then lastly, going back to California, would you expect, given that business coming on midyear next year, would that be a net contributor to the bottom line, neutral, or a bit of a drag on the ABD side?
Mario Molina: I don’t think we are prepared to talk, give any guidance for 2011 yet.
Chris Rigg – Susquehanna Financial Group: Okay. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense for would you normally accrue, given it's a new patient population, sort of above reimbursement, or it's more just philosophical here?
John Molina: When we are – this is John. When we are looking at those patients in the early stages, we will factor in what do the rates look like, what are we seeing in terms of utilization, because it is a population that has some experience with managed care. We have got 13,500 enrolled in our health plan already. But it is debatable whether the folks that have not selected to be in managed care are doing so because they are over or under utilizers. Those are arguments to be made in both cases.
Chris Rigg – Susquehanna Financial Group: Okay, all right. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush. Please proceed.
Sarah James – Wedbush Morgan Securities Inc: Thank you. Congratulations on the quarter. I had a follow-up question on California, on the ABD program. I wanted to know, Mario, when you mentioned earlier the population, does that include the Los Angeles subcontract through HealthNet? Is that something that would be an opportunity for you?
Mario Molina: Yes, it does. We currently have about 25% of HealthNet’s overall enrolment in Los Angeles County.
Sarah James – Wedbush Morgan Securities Inc: Got it. Okay. And then John, you commented on the rates that you're currently receiving in the state being around 300 to 400. I know there's another data point out there of where the fee-for-service rates are, which is significantly higher. So is there any reason to believe that the rates on the new population will be that far off from where the fee-for-service rates are?
John Molina: Sarah, I don’t know what the other data point you are referring to is. It may include a component of long-term care, which is certainly carved out of what we would do. It might also include behavioral health, and behavioral health drugs. So I don’t know what that other data point is.
Sarah James – Wedbush Morgan Securities Inc: Okay. Got it. I had some fee-for-service data but maybe we can discuss that off-line. I guess the last question is on utilization, if you're seeing anything in those trends that could be more of a sustainable trend rather than just a decrease off of last year's comps.
Mario Molina: Hi, this is Mario Sarah. I think it is a little bit too early to make any comments about sustainable trends. I think the two things that we have seen that are different, first of all is much lower flu utilization this year as compared to last year. And the second thing is we’re seeing lower hospital utilization. But we don’t know if that was going to be a long-term sustainable trend.
Sarah James – Wedbush Morgan Securities Inc: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Scott Fidel – Deutsche Bank: Thanks. The first question, just while you've clearly MLR improvement in most markets, in Florida there was a bit of a tick-up to 97%. Just maybe if you can comment on that and maybe just talk about how performance tracked in the reform versus non-reform markets, just given commentary from a competitor this morning that they saw pressure on the MLR in their reform counties.
John Molina: I think that – this is John. We’re also seeing some pressure in the reform counties now. Having said that, we are not completely overlapped with that competitor. So, I don’t know exactly where that stat is coming from. But we are seeing some pressure on the reform counties.
Scott Fidel – Deutsche Bank: Is that primarily where you're seeing the higher MLR? Did you see that track up as well year-over-year in the non-reform counties in Florida?
John Molina: We did see a little bit in some of the non-reform counties, primarily due to some provider contracts that have since been renegotiated that should take effect the early part of next year.
Scott Fidel – Deutsche Bank: Okay. Then I just had a follow-up on just the California ABD, Mario, maybe just philosophically – the company has done quite a bit over the last couple of years to diversify away from California, and has talked about a strategy of reducing your exposure to California. Clearly, you have a big opportunity here with ABD that's in your home market. So certainly it would be tough to ignore that. But how do you think about, particularly given the fact that this could be a very significant revenue amount that could come from this ABD, managing your revenue exposure to California if you grow this ABD versus clearly the significant opportunity that you do have there?
Mario Molina: Well, clearly we want to take advantage of the opportunity of. We are not about to walk away from good opportunities like this. On the other hand, if you look at what we have done in the past year, and especially most recently, we continue to diversify the company. We have entered a new market in Wisconsin. We have expanded – we got a service area that now covers most of the state of Texas, and we’re seeing growth there. We are growing our service area in Florida, and we have added the MMIS business with Molina Medicaid solutions. So we continue to diversify, and I’m comfortable that we are not going to end up with a situation where things become skewed towards California again, even with the growth in enrolment of the ABD population and the California health plan.
Scott Fidel – Deutsche Bank: Okay, and then just one last question, just on Wisconsin, it looks like the MLR tracked at 97.5% in the report. Obviously, very few member months, but is that where the Abri MLR was tracking in the quarter, or were there timing issues or other factors that we should consider on why the MLR was so high in Wisconsin?
Joseph White: Hi, it is Joe speaking. It is fair to say that it is the latter, just timing issues and integration issues. And we want to be very careful as we bring in a new state in terms of how we set reserves. Traditionally, Abri hasn’t run that level of MCR, and we don’t envision that going forward.
Scott Fidel – Deutsche Bank: Okay. So the run rate MLR for them is still – is considerably lower than that?
Joseph White: Yes. I would say so.
Scott Fidel – Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Charles Verdi [ph] from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Charles Verdi – Credit Suisse: Thanks. Good afternoon. First question – can you elaborate a bit on the pressure you said you are seeing in the reform counties in Florida? Am I right you have about 23,000 lives there, mostly in Broward?
John Molina: Charles, John, I don’t know the exact number, but Broward is the largest of the reform counties. I think that the premiums in the reform counties have probably been less than a lot of health plans we would like to see that with a combination of some tough provider contracting, we saw a number of plans exit Broward earlier this year.
Charles Verdi – Credit Suisse: Yes. So, basically just a premium issue, not a utilization issue or higher use of the ER or other things on the cost side that you could potentially address?
John Molina: Well, I think there are always things on the cost side you can address. I do think that utilization has been higher than what we like it to be, especially on the pharmacy side.
Mario Molina: I would also say that – this is Mario. If you look at, when we get into new markets, and I would still consider Florida to be a fairly new market for us. It takes a while to get up to speed and gain enough market share so that we can get better contracts. And we have seen that time and again as we have entered new states. So I think that over time Florida will improve.
Charles Verdi – Credit Suisse: Yes, okay. So is there any chance of getting the appropriate rate increase or what are next steps to improving profitability for that business?
Mario Molina: I think that the two most important things for us to do to improve the profitability in Florida are to continue to work to lower unit cost and to better manage the population.
Charles Verdi – Credit Suisse: Got it. And then in California, the governor signed legislation to create an exchange. I was just wondering if you had a chance to – I know the regs haven't been written yet, but if you've had a chance to think through what the implications are based on how the legislation was written for your company in California.
Mario Molina: Well, this whole exchange issue is going to be very important as we go forward, not just in California, but in all the states, and it is something that we are giving a lot of study right now. I don’t really want to comment too much beyond that because it is all still very new and very much in flux.
Charles Verdi – Credit Suisse: Got it. Anything specific that was signed that could be a source of potential new growth for your company, or are you contemplating getting into new programs like low income subsidy, that sort of thing? Anything – any other risks we should be aware of?
Mario Molina: I think it is too early to make those decisions. We are still studying this. And you have to also understand that it is going to vary tremendously from state to state. We could see regional exchanges. It is just really too soon to know, and there is not lot of experience. Utah has one, Massachusetts has one, California has passed some legislation, and it is all coming at a time when the government in California is going to change. There will be a new administration. We don’t know who’s going to be the governor yet, but I can almost guarantee you that there will be changes in the administration regardless of who is elected.
Charles Verdi – Credit Suisse: Yes. What is – this sounds pretty far out there. What's the earliest do you think that is reasonable that California actually implement what was signed into law regarding the exchange? Are we talking one year, two years?
Mario Molina: I think it is going to be a while. I mean the first thing that governor Schwarzenegger could do is appoint some people to the boards before he leaves office. But there is still an awful lot of work to be done, and I think it is on the order of years before we see the exchange implemented.
Charles Verdi – Credit Suisse: Got it. Okay, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Carl McDonald with Citigroup. Please proceed.
Carl McDonald – Citigroup: Thank you. I just wanted to get a little bit more color on the change in the cost of services ratio on the Medicaid Solutions business, and just try to understand how that will impact the prior guidance for 2011. I think you talked about something like a 20% gross margin. Is the deterioration in the ratio there just a function of some of like the implantations in Idaho that presumably will go away with time, or is there other variables that we should be thinking about?
John Molina: Carl, this is John. It is primarily due to the fact that in Maine, once we went live, while we are in-between – I think we are now considered a pilot phase instead of pure operations. The costs for correcting and making the fixes that Mario talked about are being expensed, whereas prior to go live, they were capitalized. So we are working very, very diligently to get through the pilot phase, number one, and number two cut some of those costs so that we are not carrying the same burden. I think in both Idaho and Maine, we probably went live sooner than would have been ideal, but the states wanted us to do it, and so we did it.
Mario Molina: This is Mario. I think the lesson learned from all this is that you really want to have thorough testing, and you want to have as much of the issues identified and fixed before you go live. Having said that, one that we’re going to understand is that is impossible. You never really know how these systems are going to work until you start dealing with the providers, and some of the problems that we have experienced in Idaho and Maine have been issues that were the providers didn’t understand the systems, where they had to change the way they were billing from previous contractors to our system. And those are things that can be completely anticipated with testing.
Carl McDonald – Citigroup: Okay. And then separately, on the new Texas contract, I think you started out with something in the low 60,000 in terms of enrollment, it sounds like it's closer to 50,000 now. Is that just member selection issues that have ended, or is there a chance that you could see a little bit more movement there?
Joseph White: Hi, Carl it is Joe speaking. We had a net pick up there of about 55,000. We had 10,000 members who rolled over from a previous contract we had. So in some ways we have lost people, the net increase is about 55,000.
Carl McDonald – Citigroup: Got it. Okay. Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with UBS. Please proceed.
Ken LaMont – UBS: It's actually Ken LaMont [ph] for Justin. Good evening. Just in terms of the updated 2010 MLR guidance, it looks like it's implying a fourth-quarter MLR of about 84.3%, which is in line with Q3. Should we think about this as kind of a good jumping off point going forward? And if so, what are some of the puts and takes that we should think about the MLR going up or down going forward from this level?
John Molina: This is John. You know, right now we’re not talking about 2011. As usual, we will have an Investor Day in the early part of 2011 to go through guidance, but I don’t want to get into that today.
Ken LaMont – UBS: Okay. And just in terms of the Texas lives, it looks like the MLR is about 89% there. Is the new CHIP laws – are those roughly in line with that, or are they meaningfully different?
Joseph White: Hi, it is Joe speaking again. You know, obviously when you take on new lives, you have to look at the history of those lives, the way the lives were priced and just take the best estimates that you can. Based on what we saw previously with the CHIP lives, we booked that at around 75% direct MCR.
Ken LaMont – UBS: Okay. That is helpful. Thank you. And lastly, just in terms of the new Texas ABD lives coming on next year in the Dallas area, is there a reason why that MLR would be meaningfully different than the existing Texas ABD lives you have?
John Molina: As the same answer John, the same answer as we gave with California. It is going to depend on how they set the rates, and what the provider contracts look like, and what the utilization is going to be. It’s just too early to tell at this point.
Ken LaMont – UBS: Okay, great. I appreciate the time guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Rex with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
John Rex – JPMorgan Securities Inc.: Hi, thanks. So just back on MMS again, I realize it's small, but I guess what's just striking me – I think we just cut the gross profit in half from six weeks ago. You always said this was going to be choppy. But so as you get into 2011, I'm just not sure if you answered this question a couple of questions ago. Are you still in the same place of where you expect this to trend in 2011 as these markets stabilize?
Joseph White: Hi John, it is Joe speaking. Yes, I haven’t seen – I don’t think we have seen anything this quarter that would change our views of what say fourth quarter of 2011 is going to look like. We’re just incurring more cost than we anticipated in the immediately post go-live phase. So I wouldn’t call these incremental costs necessarily, operational costs. They are really more a continuation of system build out costs, but the way the accounting works we can’t capitalize them. So again, I don’t think it changes…
John Rex – JPMorgan Securities Inc.: But you did [ph] the accounting back six weeks ago, right, or did something change in your interpretation of the accounting?
Joseph White: No, what has changed is the actual rate at which we are incurring these post go live, shall I say, system development costs. You know, we expect they will trail off once the systems are stabilized. So I really think by quarter four 2011, we are not going to look a lot different than we thought we would look back in September, but certainly fourth-quarter and first quarter of next year are probably going to be rougher than we thought.
John Rex – JPMorgan Securities Inc.: I'm correct in looking – you cut the gross profit view in half for this year, right?
Mario Molina: Close to it I think.
John Rex – JPMorgan Securities Inc.: Okay. So, just the one thing I didn't understand, maybe I misread this, I thought in earlier comments you were mentioning kind of Maine was going much better than Idaho, but then I think, Mario, you said that and then – but Joe, I thought were kind of saying Maine was where the real cost burden was. Is there something like I didn't understand there?
Joseph White: I think our feeling is operationally Maine is going much better, but one reason why, and we think frankly both states are going much better than they certainly were a short time ago, but one reason of that is we’re spending this money, we’re investing this money for the development costs. So I think it is fair to say, we feel like we’re getting much better products there, but it is costing us more than we anticipated.
John Rex – JPMorgan Securities Inc.: Okay. And then what's your outlook for full-year cash flow for 2010? I mean, it sounds like you've got some good – some big receipts post-quarter close. So where do you think you should be for full-year?
Joseph White: Yes, I think we have always been pretty clear that really the operating cash flow like many businesses is just going to trend into net income, plus depreciation and amortization. We have seen some growth in obviously claims payable as a result of the business growth. So that will add a little bit to it. But I don’t think we’re going to see anything much different from what we have seen in the past, which is going to be net income plus depreciation and amortization.
John Rex – JPMorgan Securities Inc.: So kind of for full year 2010, absent kind of another California issue, you expect that ratio to wrap up. I know…
Joseph White: Yes.
John Rex – JPMorgan Securities Inc.: Okay. Just the last thing, just on the severance costs, so do you guys have some kind of headcount reduction plan going on? This is all in the Health Plan, I take it, so I just wasn't aware you had kind of headcount reduction plans, so was it in a specific market and – and my point is being are we expecting this as a go-forward thing? Is there some kind of reduction, headcount reduction effort going on?
Mario Molina: John, this is Mario. No, we look at this really as a one-time event. We don’t anticipate further reductions.
John Rex – JPMorgan Securities Inc.: And was this kind of more one-off special situations, or were you truly kind of realigning headcount?
Mario Molina: It is a little of both, and it was at corporate, not at the health plan level. I mean, one of the things we are trying to do is to clean up some issues here at corporate.
John Rex – JPMorgan Securities Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Scott Green with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Scott Green – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Hi, thanks for the question. I'm thinking about some new opportunities in core markets, and Texas is potentially a big one you highlighted at Investor Day. You've had some success there recently, bidding for CHIP and Star Plus. I was curious. Are there initiatives you can take to further distinguish yourselves in advance of a procurement? So I know you've often highlighted NCQA accreditation. For example, I think Texas encourages the Medicaid HMOs to enroll Star Plus Medicare duals. So maybe you might be expanding Medicare networks. Any initiatives like that?
Mario Molina: Well, this is Mario. I don’t want to comment on specific initiatives, but I think you have hit the nail on the head. One of the things that we have talked about for years is the importance of quality and being able to document that quality through NCQA Accreditation. If you look at the Healthcare Reform Act, one of the things it talks about for qualified health plans is that they be accredited. So the investment that we have made in getting our health plans accredited will pay off. Almost all of our health plans are now accredited. We have got a couple of more to go, and it is only a matter of time before they are accredited. Another thing that I think you mentioned which is important, is the coordination of benefits and care for the dual eligible population. United recently put out a paper on that. And we have believed in that for a long time. We think there are opportunities to do a better job of coordinating these programs through a special needs plan contract, and incorporating the funding streams from the Federal government and the state government, and wrapping that around the care of the duals. So these are all tools that we have that we think can add value in the various states where we operate now, and position us well to take advantage of the Healthcare Reform Act come 2013 and 2014.
Scott Green – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you. A couple of other questions here – in Florida, is your expectation – is the rate increase there still 1.4% as you had talked about previously?
John Molina: Yes.
Scott Green – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. In Michigan, I know it passed a budget. Was there any rate increase there?
John Molina: I think it was about 1.5%.
Scott Green – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. So that would be in your guidance at this point?
John Molina: Yes.
Scott Green – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. The MLR in Michigan in the current quarter, was there any other retroactive reimbursement recoupments or anything like that? Or is the 85-7, is that a pure number at this point?
John Molina: That is pretty pure number.
Scott Green – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. And was there any success in trying to recover some of that premium recoupment from providers? I think you had talked about that in an 8-K before.
Joseph White: A modest amount.
Scott Green – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then one last question, if I may, on the flu. Can you talk about how you're positioned to handle flu costs this year versus last, either from a vaccine supply perspective, or does that even matter at the end of the day? Or is it – are you kind of at the mercy of how much flu strain there is out there?
Mario Molina: This is Mario. I think there are several issues here. One is, we would encourage everyone to become immunized. Not only to protect yourself, but to protect the people around you. This is a phenomenon known as herd immunity. So the more people that are immunized the less transmission of the flu there is going to be. So, we have encouraged all of our employees to be vaccinated. We have active campaigns to encourage all of our members. Having said that, we have about 1.6 million members in the United States, and while they may be concentrated in a few areas, it is still a very small part of the overall population. So we’re trying to do our part but we alone can’t make a –- we can’t have a big influence on the flu season. So a lot of this is really beyond our control. The other things that we can do is try to encourage people to use emergency rooms appropriately, and that has been a struggle for years. The Medicaid population typically overuses the emergency department, and we continue to work on that. And it always gets worse in the flu season. Many patients who go to the emergency room with flu symptoms don’t really need to be there.
Scott Green – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And Mr. Mario, as there are no further questions at this time, I will now turn the call back to you. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.
Mario Molina: Well, thank you everyone for joining us, and let me just close by encouraging everyone to go get a flu shot.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

===== 2010 Q2  (2010-08-04 17:00:00) =====
Executives:  Juan José Orellana – VP, IR Mario Molina – CEO John Molina – CFO Joseph White – Chief Accounting Officer Terry Bayer – COO Jim Howatt – Chief Marketing Officer
Analysts:  Josh Raskin – Barclays Capital Chris Brek (ph) Tom Carroll – Stifel Nicolaus John Rex – JP Morgan Scott Green – Bank of America Merrill Lynch 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Molina Healthcare’s second quarter 2010 earnings call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions) As a reminder this conference is being recorded, Wednesday August 4, 2010. I would now like to turn the call over to Juan José Orellana, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan José Orellana: Thank you, (Lensie). Hello everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare’s financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2010. The company’s earnings release reporting its results was issued today after the market closed, and was posted for viewing on our company website. We also issued another press release shortly after our earnings release. That second release announced our offering of common stock. Certain securities regulations prohibit the discussion of the offering or of any of the filings that have or will be made in connection with that offering. As a result, there can be no discussion of the offering on this call or on other similar calls until the offering is complete. The offering also limits our ability to comment on our expectations about the future. We therefore ask that during the question-and-answer session at the end of this call, you limit your questions to matters having only to do with our second quarter earnings announcements. On the call with me today are Dr. Mario Molina, our CEO; John Molina, our CFO; Terry Bayer, our COO; Dr. Jim Howatt, our CMO; and Joseph White, our Chief Accounting Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. Our comments today will contain forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission including our Form 10-K Annual Report for fiscal year 2009 and our Form 10-Q quarterly reports and our Form 8-K current reports. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab of our company website or on the SEC’s website. All forward-looking statements made during today’s call represent our judgment as of August 4, 2010, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements. This call is being recorded, and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available over the Internet through the company’s website at molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina.
Mario Molina: Thank you Juan José. Hello everyone and thank you for joining our earnings call. I will start today’s call by reviewing key company events for the quarter and then turn the call over to John, who will review the financial details of the quarter. We’d had busy quarter. On the growth front, we were awarded a Star Plus Medicaid managed care contract for the Dallas service area. Our Molina Medicaid solutions product HealthPass went live in Idaho in June. And although technically not a second quarter event, we reached a definitive agreement to acquire Abri Health Plan, a Medicaid health plan in the state of Wisconsin. Our health plans continued to perform well with marked improvements in California and New Mexico. Let me highlight each of these key events. In Texas, we were awarded a contract for the Star Plus program. The Star Plus program is the Texas Medicaid managed care program designed to provide primary care, acute care and long-term care services to the aged, blind or disabled populations. The contract is for the Dallas service area which includes Dallas and six surrounding counties. It is estimated that there are approximately 50,000 aged blind or disabled beneficiaries in this service area, who will be making a choice in the first quarter of 2011 among Molina and two other health plans. We’re excited about this contract award as it further expands our footprint in the state of Texas and increases our involvement in the care of aged blind or disabled beneficiaries. As a remainder, Molina Healthcare, Texas already serves approximately 42,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in the Harris Service Area, which includes Houston and in the Bexar service area which includes San Antonio. Nearly 45% of those members fall in the aged blind or disabled category. On May 3rd of this year, we introduced Molina Medicaid solutions, our fiscal intermediary business, following the closing of our acquisition of HIM from Unisys. We are pleased to announce that we began the operations phase of our contract in the state of Idaho on June 1. As with any major systems implementation, the updating of software or hardware may result in temporary glitches. There have been a few bumps on the road, but our team in Idaho was working closely with the state and the local provider community to resolve issues arising from the new system. A few weeks ago we announced our entry into a definitive agreement to acquire Abri Health Plan in Wisconsin. Abri is a Medicaid managed care provider that currently participates in the BadgerCare Plus and SSI Managed Care programs in Wisconsin. Abri servers approximately 18,000 members with the bulk of the membership concentrated in the Milwaukee area. In April, Wisconsin made contract awards for the Southeast region RFP covering 250,000 beneficiaries to begin on September 1, 2010. Abri retained its current business and achieved the second highest score in the RFP. Abri is well positioned for auto assignment enrollments as the state developed an auto assignment algorithm that favors plans with higher scores in the RFP. This transaction is consistent with the revenue and geographic diversification efforts that we have discussed in the past and it provides a new platform for growth in a new state for Molina. Wisconsin is a Medicaid market, it is much like Michigan was when we began operating there back in 1997. In Michigan at that time, there was considerable fragmentation of Medicaid health plans, which provided a full ground for capturing additional market share and for pursuing in-market acquisitions. Wisconsin shares these characteristics. Furthermore, additional growth could come from future successful RFP responses as Medicaid contracts covering the rest of Wisconsin will be up for renewal at the end of 2011.  The consideration for the Abri transaction is approximately $16 million subject to standard adjustment adjustments as well as our obtaining the required state approvals. We expect the transaction will close in the third quarter. We’re excited about entering the Wisconsin Medicaid market and look forward to working with the state and the local provider community. Moving on to the rest of our health plans, a mild seasonal flu in 2010 and our implementation of various contracting and medical management initiatives resulted in lower medical costs. Furthermore, the decrease in the medical care ratio in California and New Mexico was largely the result of our contracting efforts. We have seen progress in these markets both in terms of utilization and unit costs. Over the past year and a half, we’ve taken many actions to improve our earnings performance without sacrificing growth. We are pleased that our actions are bearing fruit. I look forward to updating you next quarter and I will now turn the call over to John, who will provide more details regarding the financial results.
John Molina: Thank you Mario. You may have noticed in today’s press release and 10-Q that we are now presenting two reportable segments in our 10-Q, our Health Plan segment and our Molina Medicaid Solution segment. The Health Plan segment includes all of the operations that we have in the past, reported on a consolidated basis, that is our HMOs and our corporate parent. Any revenues and expenses not specifically tied to the solutions business, such as interest expense and the cost of general corporate operations are included in the Health Plan segment. Our 10-Q is replete with disclosure concerning Molina Medicaid Solution segment. We have filed our 10-Q today so that you’ll have the benefit of that added disclosure as you review our earnings release. For now I want to point out some of the changes that you will see in the earnings release itself. First, our income statement now includes service revenue and cost of service revenue. Both of these accounts specifically capture revenue expense for the solutions business. Second, we are breaking out premium taxes as a separate line item on our income statements. Third, we have replaced the term core administrative ratio with the term G&A ratio. Now that we have raising out premium taxes as a separate line item on our income statement, there is no need to talk about subcategories of the G&A ratio. Fourth, nearly all of the depreciation expense associated with the solutions business is reported as cost of services revenue. Also a portion of the amortization of the purchase price of the solutions business is reported as a reduction to service revenue. This means that the depreciation and amortization as shown on our income statement is less than the amount we reported for D&A on our cash flow statement. For your convenience, we have included tables in both our earnings release and 10-Q, that reconciled depreciation and amortization as recorded in our income statement to that reported on our cash flow statement. Now moving onto our results. Operating revenue for the quarter was nearly $1 billion, up $72 million or approximately 8% from the second quarter of 2009. The primary drivers in revenue growth was growth of membership of nearly 10% and the inclusion of service revenue associated with our Molina Medicaid Solutions fiscal intermediary business. Higher enrollment contributed about two-thirds of our revenue growth, while our newly acquired solutions business contributed the other third. The growth in enrollment and in the fiscal intermediary business helped offset decreases in premium rate at several of our health plans. Declines in premium rates were approximately 4% on a per member per month basis. The State of Michigan’s decision to retroactively adjust premium rates back to October 1, 2009 lowered premium revenue for this quarter by $5.5 million and pre-tax income by $5 million. This equates to nearly $0.12 per share. Overall, the pressure on premium rates continues to reflect challenging budget situations across our states. However, we did receive positive news in Washington, where rates increased by approximately 2.5% effective July 1, 2010. We finished the quarter with enrollment of approximately 1.5 million members. Our enrollment has grown by 133,000 members since the second quarter of 2009. Although the enrollment growth remains ahead of historic levels, our rate of growth in 2010 to-date has been less than what we experienced for the same time period of 2009. Medical care costs decreased 5% on a PMPM basis in the second quarter of 2010, compared with the second quarter of 2009, dropping our medical care ratio in the second quarter of 2010 to 86% compared with 86.8% in the second quarter of 2009. As Mario pointed out, our implementation of various contracting and medical management initiatives was one reason for the decrease in our MCR. The pharmacy carve outs in Ohio and Missouri involved a flu season and we experienced in 2009 and reductions in Medicaid fee schedules after June 30, 2009 were also factors. General and administrative expenses were $78 million or 7.8% of total revenue, compared with $65 million or 7% of total revenue for the same quarter last year. The increase in our G&A spend was the result of almost $7 million of Medicare related administrative costs, necessary to support our expansion of that business which is nearly doubled since the second quarter of last year. We also expensed almost $2 million of acquisition costs related to the Molina Medicaid Solutions business. Earnings per share for the second quarter were $0.41 or $10.6 million compared with earnings at $0.56 per diluted share or $14.6 million for the same period last year. Remember, that the second quarter of 2009 was helped by approximately $4.4 million of favorable tax benefits. While the second quarter of this year was hurt by the $5.5 million Michigan retro rate adjustment or about $3.4 million after tax, which I talked about earlier. EBITDA for the second quarter of 2010 was $35 million, $6 million higher than in the second quarter of 2009. Cash flow from operating activities was $52 million in the second quarter. we had positive operating cash for both quarter and year-to-date despite the fact that we’re not receiving advanced revenue from Ohio this year. Improved cash flow between the second quarters of 2010 from the second quarter of 2009 was predominantly due to higher depreciation and amortization expense, higher medical claims liabilities and higher accounts payable balances. It is worth noting that the operating income as a percentage of revenue for the Molina Medicaid Solution segment far exceeds that of our Health Plan segment. Although we expect the operating profit margin percentage of our Molina Medicaid Solutions segment to decline as our Idaho and main contracts commence full operations, we nevertheless believe that our trading profit margin percentage of that segment will remain greater than that of the Health Plan segment despite lower revenue base. Excluding restricted investments, the company had cash and investments of approximately $673 million. The parent company had unrestricted cash and investments of approximately $47 million. I want to point out that the capital requirements of our Molina Medicaid Solution segment are considerably less than those of our Health Plan segments subsidiaries except in the case of new contract startups. There are no cash reserve requirements and regulatory approval is not required for the subsidiary in our MMIS segment to pay dividends to us. Days in claims payable for deeper service cost this quarter remains flat over last quarter at 44 days in spite of the fact that the inventory dropped. Before we open the call to take any questions I want to remind everyone about the comments made by Juan José at the beginning of the call. There can be no discussion of our common stock offering on this call. This offering limits our ability to comment on our expectations about the future. Please limit your questions to our earnings release. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. We’re now ready to take calls. Operator, we’re ready to take calls.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead with your question.
Josh Raskin – Barclays Capital: Hi thanks, good afternoon. I guess, first question is on the operations, you mentioned in the press release and Mario spoke to it as well, a very difficult premium rate environment, I think that’s a little different than some of the more contractive comments that we’ve heard from some of your peers. So maybe you could talk about what you’re seeing, is that more of an expectations going forward or is that have to do with things like Michigan coming back with the retroactive reduction in premiums?
Mario Molina: Hi Josh, this is Mario. As we have said all along this year, we’re really expecting premium rate increases in the low single-digits and we think state budgets are certainly under pressure. We think that the passage of the extended (inaudible) will be helpful and we look forward to that. The differences that you may note between us and some of the other health plans may have to do with the states that we operate in as well. We don’t overlap a lot with the other publicly traded managed care plans that are in the Medicaid space, but this is our experience.
Josh Raskin – Barclays Capital: Okay, that’s helpful. And then in Michigan, it looks like the net impact was $5 million, so the cost reduction was minimal. Do they not change anything on the fee schedule?
John Molina: No Josh, this is John. What happened was the state had originally submitted a range for our rates to the legislature and the state had thought that they had paid the actual point within the range in the midpoint well in fact, they paid it to high end. So they went back and readjusted the rates to fix them at the midpoint of the range and that was one issue. The second issue was they discovered that they had invitingly enrolled some members who were eligible both for Medicare and Medicaid into the health plans, which they shouldn’t have done. So it took the premium back for those members and the fact that we were able to then recoup about $0.5 million for claims that we had paid out on behalf of the members that shouldn’t have been enrolled.
Josh Raskin – Barclays Capital: Okay so they gave you a rate, you guys executed a contract and then they came back and said, we’ve decided, we’re just going to pay you less?
John Molina: I think what they said was we didn’t intend you to pay you as much as we did, we intended to pay you and that’s really sound great, but that rate was in supposed to be in the midpoint of the actuarial range and we – in error (ph) put it at the high end of the range.
Josh Raskin – Barclays Capital: Okay, got you. And then was there any appropriate reserved element in the quarter?
John Molina: Nothing that was outside what our normal EPD is?
Josh Raskin – Barclays Capital: Okay and then, I’m sorry to even ask because I am feeling that you’re just not going to answer this, but did you give the breakout between primary and secondary shares in the offering?
Mario Molina: We did not discuss the offering, no.
Josh Raskin – Barclays Capital: Are you going to be filing so that, is the filing going to come for the secondary in any time soon or?
John Molina: Say that again Josh.
Josh Raskin – Barclays Capital: I guess at some point you’re going to file some sort of perspectives or something for the offering, is that expected to come soon?
Mario Molina: Yes and we put out a press release earlier today on the offering. So check the release.
Josh Raskin – Barclays Capital: Okay, I just didn’t see any details in the release. I guess we can follow-up. Okay, thanks guys.
Mario Molina: Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Brek (ph) with (inaudible).Please go ahead.
Chris Brek: Good afternoon guys. You commented in your press release that you observed hospitalized billing from more intensive levels of care in the physician and outpatients cost segment, I guess are you just trying to make a point that you’re observing that or are you saying you’re going back potentially questioning the legitimacy of some of those claims. Any detail there would be great.
John Molina: I think, this is John, I think that the answer is sort of all of the above. One of the things that we have done is we have shared our data with a couple of the states and that has caused them to re-look at how their states fee-for-service system pays these claims. We’re also going back and looking at those claims for things like switch (ph) removal which truly are not emergency in nature and talking to the hospitals and the providers about those goals.
Chris Brek: Okay and then can you tell us how much of the year-to-date cash flow changed is because of Ohio? It’s down about $70 million year-to-date, how much of that is from Ohio?
Joseph White: That is bulk of it, its Joe speaking, pretty much consistent with what we would add at the first quarter. Ohio practice hasn’t changed, they continue to pay it now mid month versus last date of previous month.
Chris Brek: Okay and that – so if its bulk, that’s not just for one month or is that for one month?
Joseph White: Ohio revenues can run about $90 million easily in a month.
Chris Brek: Okay, and okay and then lastly on Unisys, is anything tracking materially different than you’ve expected either positively or negatively?
Terry Bayer: This is Terry Bayer. No.
Chris Brek: Okay, thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.
Tom Carroll – Stifel Nicolaus: Hey guys, good afternoon. A question I see more just looking for a bit more color on the challenges you’re facing in Idaho and particularly does this have a change do you think of turning into or creating an opportunity for the politicians in the market to make a lot of noise?
Terry Bayer: This is Terry Bayer. I think at this point, recall we acquired the HIM division of Unisys on May 1 and the system went live on May 31, technically June 1. So our involvement in the pre go live activities was very limited. The DDI (ph) period is a several year period prior. It is not unusual to have glitches or biffs when you first go live with a new systems and I’ll make a couple of comments about Idaho that it really enhanced the provider anxiety. Due to budgetary constraints the state did withhold Medicaid provider payments, delay them. So as it simultaneous with the system go live. So you can imagine there is a new system and there is also been withholding a payments. This is a primarily impacted to the smaller providers who are more cash flow dependent. But secondarily there was a major provider reenrollment in Idaho and this is not the case as an example our next state coming up is not experiencing that same kind of a provider reenrollment. So when you ask the providers to reenroll, you’re now subjected to all of the errors that can occur building in that provider database. So when you compound these with the new system it’s not surprising that we have discovered issues. It’s our responsibility to make sure going forward we’re meeting the providers needs, the state has made advanced payments to ensure there are no cash flow problems and we have beefed up our on the ground support in Idaho and in the call centers so that in the coming months we will resolve the issues for the providers and we’re – our partners with the state of Idaho on this for the long haul so we’re addressing it now and end learning from this as well because it’s our first one.
Tom Carroll – Stifel Nicolaus: Terry, great. That’s exactly the color I was looking for in the market. Do you anticipate that the issues will be taken care off over what period of time, I mean within the next quarter?
Terry Bayer: It’s difficult to predict, so I have to take do that but we’ve got a joint letter going out to the providers this week and we’ll be keeping them posted and again hard to predict because as we don’t – as more claims are paid out and more types of providers that call in the questions we’ll just resolve it as it comes and we’ll update you next quarter on the progress we made.
Tom Carroll – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay and do you have any further opinion on rate changes as they impact 2011 for some of your larger markets like Ohio and California and Michigan, Washington I think you mentioned?
John Molina: Tom we’re not going to comment on 2011.
Tom Carroll – Stifel Nicolaus: So no more okay, thank you very much.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) The next question comes from the line of John Rex with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
John Rex – JP Morgan: Thanks, so during the course of the quarter there has been bit more talk from some others about just much lighter utilization trends, even Medicaid books maybe then I’m hearing from you and I just want to get a little more color commentary just straight aside from the provider coding side, just what you’re seeing in straight utilization terms so I’m thinking I’ve heard like talks of kind of OB being down in Medicaid populations and just broadly utilization down. Are you not seeing that to any meaningful extent?
Jim Howatt: This is Dr. Jim Howatt. We certainly have seen different utilization. The utilization in the first quarter and leading over into the second quarter was higher than normal for pediatric RSV infections which often require hospitalization. And remember also that H1N1 really started its peak in mid to late April. So we expect to see utilization trend downward and we think we’re starting to see that now but it has been relatively flat for us in the first two quarters.
John Molina: And again John some of this may also reflect a different states that we’re in as compared to other health plans.
John Rex – JP Morgan: So even like – even when you look at things like your bad days remember that’s held pretty steady also?
Jim Howatt: Yes it has I mean there is regional differences and we’ve also taken on some newer sicker members that the same story last year with rapid growth and acquisition of new members. We see higher costs. So they’re whole series of moving parts here.
John Rex – JP Morgan: And I understand because the month-to-month stuff on this is a little tough on this business but did it trend that way pretty much throughout the quarter, so again we thought so much of it significant slackening in June from lot of indications we’re getting from providers out there, is that not from it take it also the kind of something that you were seeing your claim at least in your claims run.
Jim Howatt: Yes I think we’re seeing improvement in June. We do monitor this using authorizations rather than claims and we’re starting to see trends downward from earlier utilization.
Mario Molina: But John I think this is Mario, I think it’s also fair to say that our utilization trends have been flatter perhaps than what some other people have talked about.
John Rex – JP Morgan: Right, so your year-over-year comp for offset being a factor is I guess.
Mario Molina: Yes.
John Molina: Yes, John let me also caution you, when you compare the year-over-year you have to also remember we had $5 million net in terms of the take back from Michigan that wasn’t associated with medical costs, that was pulled out and then you also had the pharmacy carve outs in Ohio and Missouri and since we typically do pretty well on the pharmacy piece we actually had to step back when they carved that business that was really difficult Missouri to just compare MCR 2009 to 2010 and draw a lot of conclusions.
John Rex – JP Morgan: Okay and then just on your claims inventory I think it was like down $50 million sequentially and maybe that was just getting closer to where you’d been in the end of the year, at the end of December call but is that kind of where you expected to be or was that in something was there something significant there in terms of a speed up?
John Molina: No I think that it’s sort of back to where we wanted to be towards the end of the year.
Joseph White: Those inventories, its Joe speaking, those inventories tend to draw down in the summer, peak in the spring and the fall and draw down right around the middle of the summer and Christmas time.
John Rex – JP Morgan: Okay and then just I understand you can’t talk on outlook at this point but do you have a plan to refresh outlook post transaction or can you even talk about that?
Joseph White: We can’t even talk about that.
John Rex – JP Morgan: Okay, all right. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Green with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Scott Green – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi thanks for the question. I noticed in the press release that pharmacy unit costs were up and my understanding was that you had re-contracted pharmacy towards the end of last year and I would have thought we would have seen some sort of decrease in unit cost. Can you talk about that?
John Molina: I think it’s the mix of Medicare members, I mean we doubled our Medicare enrollments and I think it had a tendency to pull it up also when we carved out Missouri which was all tentative and Ohio where the bulk of its tenant those costs, those drug costs sort of so again it’s going to change the waiting.
Scott Green – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, and did you exit the California AIM program in the quarter?
Terry Bayer: We’ve been winding – this is Terry Bayer. We’ve been winding down the California AIM program so we stopped accepting new members late last year and during this quarter the final rollout would have occurred those had been enrolled so it’s been a dwindling number but it would, is now over.
Scott Green – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And I guess to markets could you talk about the MOR (ph) increase in Texas and what drove that sequentially?
Joseph White: This is Joe speaking, I think the main thing we’re seeing in Texas is I can’t necessarily speak sequentially but back in September 1, 2009 we had some premium cuts from the state specifically in the Star Plus product line which is there, aged blind disabled product lines and certainly since then we’ve seen relative decrease of the profitability.
Scott Green – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, I think it was like 750 basis points sequentially though.
John Molina: Well if you look at the PMPM premiums for Texas they have gone down and the medical costs have actually gone up a little bit so it probably reflects both the combination of the decrease in the premiums and back that you’ve got a lot of Star Plus members there. So almost half of our membership are the aged blind and disabled in Texas.
Mario Molina: There was smaller population like in Texas where we added about 40,000 members also have a more inherent degree of variability in their supported medical cost. The impact that shifts in reserve development are much more profiled in the population.
Scott Green – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay and then lastly in Florida are you still complying with continuity of care issues there or just your outlook on helping to lower the medical cost there?
Jim Howatt: This is James Howatt. I think you’re refereeing especially to the pharmacy costs.
Scott Green – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes.
Jim Howatt: And they are coming down quarter-over-quarter they were at 1point, I think in the 70s or 80s they’re now in the high 20s, low 30s. It’s still an issue and they’re driven largely by psychotropic drugs but as we can we’re introducing generics and lower cost alternatives without disrupting treatment.
Scott Green – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Next we have a follow-up question from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.
Tom Carroll – Stifel Nicolaus: Hey guys quick Abri follow-up question. Abri has like 3,000 Medicare advantage members that you downstream to Universal America, and so the question is what percent of the premium does Molina keep in that contract if any?
John Molina: There is a retention, but we’re not going to disclose that.
Tom Carroll – Stifel Nicolaus: Would you suggest that it is of a traditional amount that we see in contracts like this?
John Molina: We don’t do make these contracts so I don’t know.
Mario Molina: I would comment I would (ph) tradition we don’t have other arrangements like this, it’s hard for us to really know.
Tom Carroll – Stifel Nicolaus: But across the industry, I mean we can see things like this, would you suggest it’s out of the ordinary or you’re just not going to comment.
Mario Molina: We’re not going to comment.
Tom Carroll – Stifel Nicolaus: all right, thank you.
Mario Molina: Okay.
Operator: Dr. Molina, there are no further questions at this time. I would now turn the call back to you.
Mario Molina: Well thanks for the questions. we want to thank all of you for joining us. we look forward to discussing next quarter’s results.
John Molina: Actually we can’t say that Mario, that’s a forward-looking statement.
Mario Molina: Good bye everybody.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a great day everyone.

===== 2009 Q4  (2010-02-11 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Juan José Orellana – VP, IR Mario Molina – President and CEO John Molina – CFO
Analysts: Josh Raskin – Barclays Capital Tom Carroll – Stifel Nicolaus
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Molina Healthcare’s fourth quarter earnings conference call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions) As a reminder this conference is being recorded, Thursday February 11, 2010. I would now like to turn the conference over to Juan José Orellana, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan José Orellana:
 : On the call with me today are Dr. Mario Molina, our CEO; John Molina, our CFO; Terry Bayer, our COO; Dr. James Howatt, our CMO; and Joseph White, our Chief Accounting Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. Our comments today contain numerous forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, including statements regarding our earnings, guidance and operations for 2010 and the pending acquisition of the HIM business from Unisys. All of our forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions which are subject to numerous risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission including our previously filed 10-K annual report for 2008 and our 10-K annual report for 2009 to be filed early next month. Our 10-Q quarterly reports are – at end our 8-K current reports. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab of our company website or on the SEC's website. All forward-looking statements made during today's call represent our judgment as of February 11, 2010, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements. This call is being recorded, and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available over the Internet through the company's website at molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina.
Mario Molina: Thank you, Juan José. Good afternoon everyone. Our remarks today will be brief since we provided preliminary estimated results about a month ago, and we also had an opportunity to provide additional information about our company and our results during our Investor Day on January 27. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we incurred a net loss of $4.5 million or $0.18 per share. For the full year of 2009, we earned net income of approximately $31 million or $1.19 per share. Those are quarterly and yearend results are consistent with the estimates we had provided during our preliminary earnings announcement on January 11, 2010. The four main factors, which drove our poor fourth quarter financial results, which I’ll discuss in detail were margin compression related to pressures on state budgets, higher medical costs due to widespread flu impact, higher cost associated with substantial enrollment growth, and higher emergency room cost. First, state tax revenues plunged nearly 21%, the sharpest decline in the last 46 years. With tax revenues down so much, states were less scrambling to somehow fill budget gaps in order to achieve a balanced budget. Some of the states in which we operate responded to this crisis by cutting Medicaid premium rates or by changing the covered benefits on their managed care. For example, our health plans in Michigan, Missouri, Washington and New Mexico all experienced premium rate reductions during 2009. Some of these premium cuts were partially offset by reductions in payments to providers. However, the overall impact was a $14 million reduction in medical margin in 2009. The second factor affecting our fourth quarter and full year results was the H1N1 flu epidemic. The states of California, Michigan, Ohio and Washington account for little over 75% of our membership. The incidence of flu in each of these four states exceeded the national average. Unlike the seasonal flu which has historically represented a bigger health risk for the elderly, the H1N1 flu appears to have posed a greater health risk for younger people. As a reminder, approximately 87% of all our members are part of the TANF eligibility group which is comprised primarily of young mothers and their children. States like Washington and California have a higher percentage of these patients because nearly all of our membership in these states is from the 10F group. We believe that our geographic footprints and our patient mix may help explain why our health plans were severely affected by the flu in 2009. Third, we believe that rising unemployment in 2009 drove higher enrollment at our health plans. In 2009, our enrollment increased by nearly 16% compared to a 9% increase in 2008. Our study shows that new members drive higher medical cost during the first nine months of their enrollment. Finally, higher emergency room costs affected our results. The results were driven by a higher unit cost and increases in utilization. Higher unit costs were the result of provider adoption of billing methodologies that included the use of codes representing higher levels of service. We discussed these factors in greater detail at our Investor Day, approximately two weeks ago. Also on our Investor Day our guest speaker, Tony Rodgers, a former director of the Arizona Medicaid program, provided a high level overview of the MMIS business in anticipation of our acquisition of the HIM business of Unisys. Joseph White, our Chief Accounting Officer reviewed some of the important accounting difference between the MMIS business and our managed care business. I highly encourage investors that have not heard our Investor Day presentations to listen to these replays on our website at www.molinahealthcare.com. As these presentations captured the challenges as well as the opportunities that we currently face in our business. I would now like to turn the call over to John.
John Molina: Thank you, Mario. Premium revenue for the quarter was $962 million, up $153 million or approximately 19% from the fourth quarter in 2008. For all of 2009, premium revenues increased by $569 million or 18% to $3.7 billion compared to premiums in 2008 of $3 billion. Investment income for 2009 was down nearly $12 million when compared to 2008. This decline was primarily due to lower interest rates throughout 2009. As Mario pointed out, net losses for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 were $4.5 million or $0.18 per share compared with earnings of $15 million or $0.55 per diluted share for the same period last year. Net income for the full year was $31 million or $1.19 per share compared with net income of $60 million or $2.15 per share for 2008. Medical costs remained elevated. Our medical care ratio increased to 87.5% in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to 84.7% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Sequentially, our medical care ratio increased by 80 basis points over the pervious quarter. During the fourth quarter, hospitals continue to cover emergency room visits at higher levels than they did in the fourth quarter of 2008 which resulted in higher costs per visit. For all of 2009, the cost per visit was up 9% for emergency services, when compared to 2008, and utilization was also up by 8% year-over-year. The impact of the flu decreased earnings per share by $0.47 in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, and decreased our earnings per share for all of 2009 by $0.83 per share. Excluding costs associated with the flu, the impact of higher emergency room costs decreased our earnings by $0.15 in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 and increased our earnings for all of 2009 by $0.77 compared to last year. Our membership at year end stood at 1.45 million members, up 16% from a year ago. The membership growth contributed to the increase in our premium revenues. It had also contributed to the increase in our medical costs. Our study showed that on average medical costs associated with new membership are highest during the first nine months of enrollment. However, enrollment grew steadily throughout 2009 with a continuous monthly influx of new patients diluting the cost decline anticipated from patients who have been enrolled with us for 10 months or more. We expect to see slower enrollment growth in 2010, which we expect will help bring down our medical costs. General and administrative expenses, including premium taxes were $116 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, representing 12% of total revenue as compared with $92 million or 11.3% of total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2008. Premium taxes were the largest contributor to a higher G&A expenses, increasing sequentially by nearly $10 million. Our premium tax increased to $39 million or 4% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009, up from 3.2% of revenue in the third quarter. This was due to an increase in the Ohio premium tax from 5.5% to 7.7% or about $5 million, and the California premium tax retroactive from January 1 to September 30th of about $5 million, and Washington had a retroactive business tax of about $2 million. Core G&A or G&A less premium taxes decreased to 8% in the fourth quarter of 2009 as compared with 8.1% in the fourth quarter of 2008. However, on a sequential basis, core G&A increased by approximately 50 basis points. The upward creep of our core G&A ratio was due to frontloading Medicare marketing expenditures, which occur in the fourth quarter as part of the program’s open enrollment period. Network development cost associated with our new chip contract in Texas, which is scheduled to be implemented in September of 2010, and the move of our data center from California to New Mexico. Days in claims payables for the fourth quarter were 37 days, which was flat on a sequential basis compared to the third quarter. The company remains consistent in its reserving methodology. I would also like to point out, as we mentioned at our Investor Day that we received approximately 2 million more claims in 2009 than we did in 2008, and yet still ended the year with claims in inventory levels similar to the end of 2008. Positive cash flow for the fourth quarter was $25 million. Our cash flow from operating activities for all of 2009 was $155 million compared with $40 million in 2008, an increase of $115 million. Contributors to this increase included a $114 million increase in deferred revenue primarily in Ohio and a $43 million increase in medical claims and benefit payable associated with enrollment growth across the company’s health plans. Excluding restricted investments, the company had cash and investments of approximately $704 million. The parent company had free cash and investments of approximately $46 million, including auction rate securities with a fair value of $17 million. Now let me spend a moment reviewing our 2010 guidance. We are re-affirming our guidance discussed at our Investor Day on January 27, 2010. Please bear in mind that all of these figures are approximations. Premium revenues, $3.9 billion; Investment income, $9 million; Medical care ratio 86%; G&A ratio 11%; Core G&A ratio or G&A ratio excluding premium tax 7.6%. Depreciation and amortization $42.6 million; Interest expense $13.8 million; Net income, $39 million; Diluted EPS, $1.50; Diluted shares outstanding, 26 million. Not included in our 2010 guidance are the following items The anticipation dilution from the HIM acquisition; Any savings from our medical cost initiatives; Any rate increases or rate decreases other than those that we know about in California, Ohio, Utah and Washington. An important factor to keep in mind while building your models is our earnings seasonality. We expect to see 30% of our annual earnings in the first half of 2010 and 70% of our earnings in the second half. Also as it relates to seasonality, please take into consideration that our medical care ratio has historically been the highest in the first quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we’re now ready to take questions.
Operator:
 :
Josh Raskin – Barclays Capital: Hi, thanks. Just a first question. What is the normal total dollars or total cost of a flu season for you, maybe – I don’t know how you guys think about it as the fourth quarter or first quarter, I’m just trying to – what is the normal flu '08 number than versus the incremental in 2009?
John Molina: Well, Josh, I guess the first thing is we don’t know what a normal flu season is. Each year comes out a little bit differently. What we do – what we have been able to determine is the impact of the flu on this year over 2008. The total dollar – the total per share amount was $0.83, so I guess if you give me a minute I can back it into a dollar figure.
Mario Molina: The other thing to remember, Josh, is that typically in the past, the flu season for us has occurred in December, January and February. And we saw three flu seasons in 2009. The winter flu season, the H1N1 flu season around April and then another flu season in the fourth quarter. So it was a big impact.
Josh Raskin – Barclays Capital: What I was looking for is the $0.83 incremental, so does that mean that the total costs were $1.00 per share and it was $0.17 end of the year [ph]?
Mario Molina: I guess we’d have to go back and figure out what the flu impact was for 2008, Josh?
Josh Raskin – Barclays Capital: Okay, we can (inaudible) some of the states the membership numbers moved around a little bit. I guess, California was down a little bit I was little surprised by that, and then conversely I guess, Michigan and Texas were a little bit higher than we were looking for. Was there, sort of, any program changes or anything we should know about there?
Mario Molina: Well, actually Josh, in California if you go back to our third quarter call one of the things that we talked about was getting out of areas or cutting our providers that were not profitable for us, and so the strategy in California has taken hold now. In Michigan, I think two things happened. One, there was a re-date of the RSP, we got a few new counties, but also we moved up the scale in terms of the algorithm. The algorithm in Michigan is based on a number of quality factors and we were able to move up higher than the peers, and saw that more membership. And in Texas, it was – we did a small acquisition in Laredo of some ship members, which will help set a stage for our expansion which is going to come later this year.
Josh Raskin – Barclays Capital: Okay, that's preparations. Okay, thanks.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed with your question.
Tom Carroll – Stifel Nicolaus: Hi, good evening. Can you hear me okay?
Mario Molina: Yep.
Tom Carroll – Stifel Nicolaus: Very good. I guess a couple of things, the medical loss ratio is 4% to 97%, I guess this stuck me as being a bit high, especially after having kind of a critical math remembers what 50,000 ended the year at. And I think you have been operating there since December of '08. So, I guess what do you think that will improve to in 2010? And then secondly in Florida, do you believe the state is serious this time around in migrating PCCM beneficiaries over the managed care companies? I feel like that's something we’ve heard about in Florida for going on seven or eight years now?
Mario Molina: Tom, let's take the second question first. We don’t know, as you said the state of Florida continues to look at moving the PCCM members into managed care, and it always comes down to a political battle. So, we don’t have a particular view on that. The reason that the Florida medical costs were high, we did get, let's talk about a 15% increase in membership in Florida during the fourth quarter. One of the things that we know, we may have discussed this before. If we got to honor the pharmacy regimen in that the patients are getting when they come on the plan for at least 90 days. So when the patients come on they have very high pharmacy cost until we are able to get them under our formulary and bring them down. We don’t really disclose MCR targets by state, but I would – it's safe to say that we think that we can get the cost down in Florida from 97%.
Tom Carroll – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And then as a second question. You made a lot of comments in your press release about flat in-patient cost despite higher utilization. What help to support that, was that your re-contracting efforts in the last couple of years?
Mario Molina: Yes, the unit costs have come down as a result of our contracting efforts.
Tom Carroll – Stifel Nicolaus: So that’s the pricing – it’s a new contract was the primary reason, okay. Thank you.
Operator: Dr. Molina, there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference back to you.
Mario Molina: Well, thank you, everyone. We will see you at our next quarterly earnings release.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does concludes the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation. Nancy, please disconnect your lines. Have a great rest of the day, everyone.

(Operator instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Juan Jose Orellana, Vice President of Investor Relations. 
Juan José Orellana: Hello everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare's financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2009. The company's earnings release reporting its results was issued today after the market closed, and it is now posted for viewing on our company website.

This call is being recorded, and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available over the Internet through the company's website at www.molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina.
Dr. Mario Molina: The third quarter has been challenging for Molina Healthcare. Compared to the third quarter of last year, our premium revenue has grown by 16% and our membership has grown by 14%, but our profitability has suffered due to rising medical care costs. Our financial performance continues to be affected by many of the same factors we had discussed our during our second quarter conference call. These factors include higher utilization of physician services, higher outpatient costs, and an increase of new members with their higher medical costs.  In the third quarter, emergency room utilization increased in part driven by a resurgence in the 2009 H1N1 flu epidemic. As you know, President Obama recently declared a national emergency due to this novel flu epidemic. The H1N1 flu first became a factor in the second quarter. Flu activity declined during the summer months, but baseline flu activity remained elevated.  With the return of children to school in the fall, we saw a resurgence of the H1N1 flu beginning in September and continuing through October. As Dr. Michael Siegel discussed during the second quarter call, the H1N1 flu virus seems to disproportionately attack children and young adults—the patient population that comprises the majority of Molina Healthcare’s membership.  Public health officials are vigorously attempting to immunize the public, giving priority to high risk groups such as children and pregnant women. We’re doing our part to aid in this effort by administering the vaccine in our clinics in California and Virginia; however, the vaccine only recently became available in limited supply, while the H1N1 epidemic began in the second quarter of this calendar year. On another front, the California Health Plan’s results have had a continuing negative effect on our profitability, decreasing our consolidated earnings by $0.58 per share so far this year. Not all of our contracts in the state are performing poorly. The problems in California are best illustrated by the poor performance under our contracts in Los Angeles County and in Yolo County and the Access for Infants and Mothers or AIM program in San Diego County. We were required to participate in the AIM program beginning in 2005 as a condition of the approval of our acquisition of Sharp Health Plan’s Medicaid contract in San Diego County. As hospital costs have increased, the premiums for the AIM program have not kept pace with these costs. As a result, we have given state regulators notice of our intention to leave the AIM program no later than July 2010. Likewise, we have given notice of our intention to leave Yolo County, and we expect that notice to be effective no later than February 2010.  Our difficulties in Los Angeles County stem from net premium decreases to HealthNet in the face of rising medical costs. As a reminder, we operate as a subcontractor to HealthNet in Los Angeles County and the premiums we receive reflect the premium paid to HealthNet less a portion they retain for certain administrative functions. As a result, we have not benefited from administrative leverage as our enrollment in Los Angeles County has grown. Los Angeles County is very large geographically. It is roughly as large as the state of Connecticut, and if it were a standalone state, it would be one of the top 5 Medicaid markets in the country based on enrollment.  We view the county as 10 micro markets, and we are evaluating our performance in each of these micro markets. In an effort to improve our profitability, we have selectively capped our enrollment in some markets and are restructuring our provider network in certain areas. As a result, there may be declines in our California Health Plan’s enrollment over the next few quarters. Our response to the challenges posed by these contracts recognizes the differing long-term potential of each contract. We’re often asked why we’ve not chosen to simply exit the California market with its budget problems and large deficits. To answer this question, we must put California in its proper perspective. We have operated here for three decades and managed through difficult times. Traditionally, it has been a profitable market for us. California is a large and diverse state, and we operate in six of its 58 counties. If California were a country, it would have the eighth largest economy in the world, behind Italy and ahead of Brazil and Russia. It is the state with the largest number of Medicaid beneficiaries—about 7 million—and has the second largest Medicaid budget in the country.  All of the current healthcare reform proposals under consideration by congress include expanding the Medicaid program. The three states that stand to benefit the most from the proposed Medicaid expansions are California, Florida, and Texas. If you believe, as we do, that there will be healthcare reform that includes Medicaid expansion in the future, it is of strategic importance for us to maintain our presence in California and these other states. Part of our strategy is to find a way to maintain a profitable presence in California, Florida, and Texas as we await the implementation of healthcare reform. The impact of the H1N1 flu epidemic is significant and may grow worse. In addition, we do not know what the effect of the usual seasonal flu will be this winter. A report issued this month by the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government reports that 49 states saw total tax collections fall during the second quarter of 2009 and that overall state tax collection experienced a record drop of 17%. Therefore, as virtually all states face budget problems, premium rate increases are uncertain, as are optional Medicaid benefits.  With the cessation of federal stimulus package payments to states at the end of 2010, states may begin to tighten their eligibility requirements. All of these things could result in declining premium revenue. This changing landscape requires us to rethink our strategy. For the past few years, we pursued an aggressive growth strategy. We have nearly our enrollment over the past 6 years and have diversified geographically, but this has placed some pressure on our profit margins. In the near term, our number one goal is to improve our profitability.  This does not mean that forego opportunities to grow and diversify the company, but we will increasingly view these opportunities selectively and only through the lens of improved profitability. We will pursue those opportunities that yield profitable growth and diversification. We will continue to examine end-market acquisition opportunities as they have traditionally been the most accretive. We will continue to aggressively pursue opportunities to strip out unnecessary costs wherever we find them. We will follow a network strategy that emphasizes more selective provider networks to both improve quality outcomes and deliver more cost-effective care. We will do all of this without sacrificing quality or abandoning our commitment to have all of our health plans accredited by the National Committee on Quality Assurance. In the near term, this may mean capping enrollment in some areas or exiting markets where premiums are inadequate to support our goals. Enrollment will drop in some markets as a result of this strategy. However, our goal is to build a stronger, more profitable organization as we position the company to take it advantage of the long-term trends in healthcare reform. In closing, I want to stress two things—first, Molina Healthcare has been in this business for nearly 30 years. We have the experience and financial resources to succeed in this environment and emerge stronger than before. Second, we remain committed to our mission and optimistic about our long-term prospects. We are a company arranging for the essential healthcare services to a growing and vulnerable population. We have a unique opportunity, and we intend to make the best of it. I would now like to turn the call over to John who will discuss the company’s third quarter performance in greater detail. 
John Molina: Earnings for the third quarter of 2009 were $0.33 per fully diluted share. Net income was $9 million for the quarter compared to $16 million reported for the third quarter of 2008. Our 2009 third quarter revenue increased 16% or $123 million compared to the third quarter of 2008. Enrollment growth was very strong across all of our markets. Our enrollment now exceeds 1.4 million members and grew by 43,000 members or 3% in the third quarter alone. However, these accelerated enrollment trends are adding to significant medical margin pressure.  In absolute numbers, Florida and California added the most members during the quarter. However, on a year to date basis, Florida and California are also the two states exhibiting the highest medical care ratios. We believe that as we streamline our networks and transition towards a more tightly managed organization, our financial results will improve. As Mario noted, the company has a long-term commitment to California and Florida, and we’re taking steps to improve the profitability of our health plans in those states. This may result in a reduction in membership in certain markets in connection with our restructuring of our provider networks and tighter utilization management.  Our medical care ratio increased from 84.6% in the third quarter of 2008 to 86.7% in the third quarter of 2009. This is an increase of 210 basis points year over year and a slight 10 basis point decrease over the prior quarter ended June 30, 2009. Nearly half of this year over year increase can be attributed to the California health plan.  As previously discussed, our primary concern is to improve the financial performance of our California Health Plan. Our medical cost trends continue to be consistent with those identified by the company during the second quarter 2009. Except in the case of outpatient costs where both utilization and unit costs have increased, our medical costs continue to be the result of higher utilization rather than higher unit costs. The increase in medical costs was most pronounced in connection with physician and outpatient costs. Together, these costs increased nearly 9% on a per member per month basis compared with the third quarter of 2008. Emergency room costs increased due to both higher emergency room utilization as well as unit costs. H1N1 and the costs associated with recently enrolled members also remained key contributors to the higher medical costs. Now let me discuss what we’re experiencing as a result of the 2009 H1N1 flu. As Mario pointed out, the disease attack rate is highest in person under age 25. This group constitutes a significant portion of our membership and is therefore more likely to have a greater impact on our results. The increased utilization trends resulting from the H1N1 flu season were most pronounced in California and Michigan, where 40% of our current enrollment resides.  It is important to note that since the H1N1 flu is a new phenomenon, it is difficult to predict what its impact will be on our fourth quarter results. However, during our third quarter, some of the key indicators we focused on to assess the severity of the flu season reflected dramatically elevated activity. For example, at our company-operated primary care clinics in California, we saw a 50% increase in visits for flu-related illness. Flu-related call volumes to our national nurse advice line increased by nearly 300%, and pharmacy costs related to respiratory illness increased by 14% when compared to the third quarter of 2008. The impact to our medical costs of H1N1-related activity was an increase of approximately 50 basis points in the medical care ratio compared to the third quarter of 2008.  As discussed during the second quarter, the company continues to observe the same trends reported by most of our peers, where providers are billing for more intensive levels of care than they were a year ago. Please refer to the table in our discussion of physician and outpatient costs in today’s press release for year to date information. We continue to excel at controlling our administrative costs during this difficult environment. G&A expenses in the third quarter were 10.7% of total revenue, or $98 million, as compared to 11.1% of total revenue for the third quarter of 2008, or $88 million. Core G&A expenses decreased 50 basis points to 7.5% of total revenue for the third quarter of 2009 as compared to 8% for the third quarter of 2008. The decrease in core G&A compared with the third quarter of 2008 was primarily due to administrative leverage as a result of premium and enrollment growth. Cash flow remained strong. Cash flow provided by operations in the third quarter increased to $130 million compared with cash flow used in operations totaling $20 million for the same period in 2008. This is an increase of $150 million. Excluding restricted investments, the company had cash and investments of approximately $680 million. The parent company had free cash and investments of approximately $54 million, including auction rate securities with fair value of $17 million. Our balance sheet remains strong with a current ratio of 1.68.  Now, I’d like to address our outlook for the remainder of 2009. Due to several factors that make it particularly difficult to predict the company’s short term medical costs and earnings, including the 2009 H1N1 flu epidemic and the declaration of national emergency by the president, higher utilization associated with new members, and state budgetary shortfalls including the uncertainty surrounding the passage of the Michigan State budget, the company is withdrawing those elements of its 2009 guidance related to its medical care costs and earnings. All other elements remain the same as previously provided. Please refer to our press release for an outline of all elements that remain the same. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Daryn Miller – Goldman Sachs.
Daryn Miller – Goldman Sachs: Your MCR year over year is up over 200 basis points. Did you say only 50 basis points of that was due to H1N1?
John Molina: That’s right, Daryn. 
Daryn Miller – Goldman Sachs: Was there any incentive comp reversal in the third quarter?
John Molina: No.
Daryn Miller – Goldman Sachs: Just thinking back to last year where we had an issue where guidance was actually lowered and that happened. Was there a reason why it wasn’t lowered this time?
Dr. Mario Molina: Why what wasn’t lowered, Daryn?
Daryn Miller – Goldman Sachs: Incentive compensation with the change in the outlook?
Joseph White: I think the difference may have been, as I recall last year, we probably had something on the books when we lowered guidance versus we didn’t have anything accrued at this time.
Daryn Miller – Goldman Sachs: So, you haven’t accrued yet for that?
Joseph White: That’s correct.
Daryn Miller – Goldman Sachs: On the Florida MCR at 95%, are you accruing to a target there or is that what the state is running at? Just provide a little bit more clarity as to what cost elements if it is higher, what is driving that higher?
John Molina: Daryn, what’s driving it higher than what we’d like and expect to see is that patients are going through a transition phase from the MediPass to the full risk HMO. As a result of that, we have to keep continuity of care, so certain drugs that are not on our formulary, we’ve got to continue to supply for a period of time. We expect over time we will bring that down below 90, but that’s an actual number; it’s not a target number.
Daryn Miller – Goldman Sachs:  That’s specifically related to the population that’s transitioning then?
John Molina: Correct.

Joshua Raskin – Barclays Capital:  Can you talk a little about the timing of the recognition of these issues and why not preannounce the quarter? It doesn’t look like you guys are sort of even in the ballpark.
John Molina: Josh, I think that the first two months of the quarter are running pretty well. We had some issues in the third month of the quarter which brought the earnings down for the whole quarter, so there was really no reason or time to do the preannouncement. 
Joshua Raskin – Barclays Capital:  Following up on that, it sounded like the summer months were okay from a flu perspective, and it picked up in September and October. If we assume 50 basis points is about $4.5 million and we make the assumption of something in the ballpark of $4 million in the month of September, do you think you’ll be profitable in the fourth quarter?
John Molina: This is why we withdrew that element of guidance. 
Joshua Raskin – Barclays Capital:  What’s differentiating Molina from some of your competitors even in the state of California? Is it the clinics or is it population or county mix? I’m just sort of curious why and certainly others have mentioned this. It just seems the magnitude for you guys seem to be particularly harsh. 
Dr. Mario Molina:  I think it’s a combination of things. Part of it as we mentioned has to do with the LA County contract where we are getting less than the full premium revenue because HealthNet withholds a portion for administrative functions. A lot of it is driven by higher hospital cost and some of it has to do with some of these other contracts like Yolo County which we’re exiting and the AIM program which we’re exiting, so it’s really a mix of all of those things. In terms of what others are saying, I don’t know. I don’t know who else has reported it in California and what they have said, but this is our experience, and as John pointed out, the first two months of the quarter, we were right on track with our guidance, and September was a very difficult month.
Operator: 
.: 
Greg Nersessian – Credit Suisse:  My first question was just on the timing of when think you guys might update the guidance. Are you going to wait till you report the actual fourth quarter or is there going to be an interim announcement? What are your thoughts on that right now? 
Dr. Mario Molina:  Right now we are not planning to give guidance for the fourth quarter if that’s what you’re asking.
Greg Nersessian – Credit Suisse:  So we won’t know what the fourth quarter looks like until you actually report it? 
Dr. Mario Molina:  Correct. 
Greg Nersessian – Credit Suisse:  And no plan to do an investor day or anything like that you typically schedule in January. 
John Molina:  We are going to have the investor day. I think right now it’s slotted for towards the end of January, January 20 or something, and we give our outlook for the year at that point, and we plan to do that. 
Greg Nersessian – Credit Suisse:  But that would be before you report the fourth quarter?
John Molina:  Correct, as we do every year. 
Greg Nersessian – Credit Suisse:  So you’ll give an update on 2009 obviously then when you’re giving the 2010 guidance? 
John Molina:  To the extent we have greater clarity on what’s going on, yes. 
Greg Nersessian – Credit Suisse:  How much membership is in the Yolo and the San Diego programs that you’re getting out of?
Dr. Mario Molina:   Those books of business are pretty small, but they are running significant losses, and that’s why we’re exiting. You’re not going to see a big impact on overall membership, but you should see an improvement in profitability as a result. 
Greg Nersessian – Credit Suisse:  Have you talked to HealthNet yet about the situation? Is there a change in mind to reassess that relationship? 
Dr. Mario Molina:  We have regular ongoing conversations with HealthNet. 
Greg Nersessian – Credit Suisse:  You mentioned that you’re meeting with regulators on the coding. Has that happened yet? Have you started to talk to them yet? What’s been the response on the ER coding so far?
Dr. Mario Molina:  I don’t think that we have met with any government agencies with regard to this yet. We’re still gathering the data. We want to be very careful and very thoughtful about this.
Greg Nersessian – Credit Suisse:  So no sense of how the regulators are going to approach this up-coding issue? 
Dr. Mario Molina:  No, but I do think it seems to be fairly widespread. 
Operator: 
.: 
Carl McDonald – Oppenheimer:  I just wanted to get a better sense of how far along the spectrum the results in California are. If you were to pull out the three counties that you highlighted, would rest of the California business be profitable or is it just that these three counties are losing a lot of money and the other counties are not losing quite as much? 
Joseph White :  It’s fair to say that the other counties are marginally profitable. 
Operator: 
.: 
John Rex – J.P. Morgan:  How did you adjust handling the $7.8 million Texas payment that reduced revenues and drove the cost ratio in that quarter so far up? I assume that all relates to prior quarters. Is that correct?
Joseph White :  It would relate to the contract year ending 08/31/09 plus obviously the stub period starting the new year in September. I think the best way to handle that is we breakout premium and medical cost by state in the back of the earnings release. I would take the 09/30/09 year to date number there as a run rate. 
John Rex – J.P. Morgan:  What strikes me though is most of that didn’t relate to the third quarter, the vast majority of it, and so if I back out that impact, I end up with an MCR of something like 85.9%.
Joseph White : I would just caution to the extent that an adjustment to that doesn’t relate to quarters before this. Also much of that is driven by claims development in previous quarters too. There’s a constant process of truing up the amount owed to Texas under the experience rebate, so to the extent, we might be going back and increasing or decreasing a portion of the rebate in prior quarters, we’re also driven by having to go back and increase or decrease our estimate of medical expenses for that quarter. 
John Rex – J.P. Morgan:  My point on this though is that but for that you wouldn’t have missed the quarter essentially? That’s the myth, and when you look down the line items across the different markets, the sequential change in the loss ratio is frankly for most of them is modest, many improved; you do that and you’re in an improved position, so I guess what I’m struggling with is what were you thinking you were going to do in the 3Q then if absent this Texas adjustment you would have been running, you would have been inline, you would have actually made the quarter, then what were we actually thinking because it actually looks like it would have been okay absent that? 
Joseph White :  There is an adjustment to Texas revenue every quarter based upon the development and experience rebate, so I don’t think it’s correct to say that we anticipated no adjustment to revenue during Q3 when we set guidance.
John Molina: The other thing I would say is that most of the states are performing pretty well. You’re right. We have seen an increase in the flu across virtually all the states. It has had an impact, and I think that it probably is going to get worse because I don’t think the flu season has peaked yet, but for the most part, the other states are performing well. There are a few isolated problems. Clearly, California is having a big negative impact on our earnings, and that has to be addressed. The issue with Texas somewhat difficult to deal with from an accounting standpoint because as Joe points out it’s a rolling number, but we think that we have a pretty good handle on that, and as he points out, going forward, if you use the year to date numbers as a run rate, you can kind of project what Texas is going to look like. There are a few issues we’ve got to deal with. Some of them are clearly within our control. They have to do with contracting, they have to do with premium rates and network strategy. Some of them like the flu epidemic due to the H1N1 and perhaps the second flu epidemic coming from the seasonal flu later in the year are outside of our control, but as I mentioned, I think the long-term prospects are good. There are some problems that have to be dealt with, but most of these are things that we cannot control. 
John Rex – J.P. Morgan:  Where would you have expected California to come in this quarter? It went up 50 basis points, from 91.7 to 92.3. Were you expecting that to improve a couple of hundred basis points? Again, I’m just trying to find what was so out of line with where your head may have been?
John Molina: Traditionally, third quarter has the lowest medical care ratio, and as I think I pointed out earlier the first two months, we were running along with what we expected. It really was a couple of factors largely in September that frankly if you look it at what’s happening with the flu season, the H1N1, we just don’t know if that’s going to continue to go up. At some point it’s got to peak, but we don’t know if it’s going to peak in October, November, or December, and that’s having a big impact on us because of our population and frankly the inabilities to tell if this is going to be outpatient or inpatient related, so I would echo Mario’s points. We have a number of states that are doing well. California, we expected it to bounce back some, and it didn’t.
John Rex – J.P. Morgan: What was the order of magnitude that you expected? I’m just trying to get an idea of what was the correct…
John Molina: I don’t want to go into giving projections by state John, but we have been working on the California issues and other issues as well. Remember we talked in the second quarter about terminating the contract in Washington for basic health. Now, that contract will run out through the remainder of the year, but it’s a problem. A number of the contracts we terminated in California have rolling termination dates, and so one of the points that I wanted to make on this call is that when we tell you we’re going to take an action, it’s not immediate. Some of these have 90-, 120-, 270-day notice requirements, so we can tell you that we’re making a change, but this is a little bit like the battleship analogy. This thing doesn’t turn on a dime. I don’t want you to think that we’re sleep at the switch, but by the same token, some of these things do take time to see the results. 
John Rex – J.P. Morgan:  You’re saying we shouldn’t think of this excess $7.8 million Texas payment for a run rate also. Is that correct? I am not sure if I understand why we shouldn’t think of it ex-fact though.
Joseph White:  John, I want to say there are many factors in any given quarter that both work favorably and unfavorably in the results, and I think to attach attention to any specific one is probably not the wisest approach. 
John Rex – J.P. Morgan:  Any detail on Michigan you can offer or comments on Michigan?
John Molina: What aspect of Michigan, John?
John Rex – J.P. Morgan: I think that was one that you’re citing specifically.
John Molina: The problem in Michigan right now is that we don’t know what’s going to happen with the budget. We were told originally to expect 4.5% rate increase, and then the budget did not pass. There has been a 1-month extension. We could know by end of this week or early next week what the budget situation is. On the other hand, they may not pass the budget; we may not get a rate increase. They may modify provider rates. They may do another extension. It’s really up in the air. With California, we’re sort of used to this. They never pass the budget on time it seems, but this is a new phenomenon in Michigan, and as I pointed out, the states are under a lot of pressure, and we don’t know for sure what’s going to happen. When the stimulus package money goes away at the end of 2010, the states are going to face tremendous pressure unless something is done, and we don’t expect the number of people on Medicaid to drop much in 2010, so all these things taken together make it a pretty uncertain environment for us right now in the fourth quarter.
John Rex – J.P. Morgan: You had spiked it out distinctly from others, so I just didn’t know if there is something else unique about the market that was on your mind. 
John Molina: It’s mainly the budget issue and the fact that they are continuing to pay us at last year’s rates, not the higher rates that we were told to expect. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions). The next question comes from the line of Craig Silver – Private Investor. 
Craig Silver – Private Investor:  I would like to ask your opinion on this healthcare reform. Maybe can tell your thoughts on the public options being discussed. Is that good, bad, or neutral for our company? 
John Molina:  It’s kind of a difficult question, Craig, but I think that for Molina Healthcare, it’s really neutral. What we basically do is contract with the government to provide health care, and we do it through the Medicaid program, the CHIP program, and the Medicare program. The public option that is being discussed is really an alternative for commercial plants, so I don’t know that it’s going to have much of an impact on us, and we’ve not really taken a position on the plan.
Craig Silver – Private Investor:  You’re showing a $10.9 million business purchase in the quarter. Could you explain what that purchase was? 
Joseph White:  That’s a combination of activity on three fronts. It’s a true-up on our purchase of our Missouri health plan back in the last quarter of 2007. It’s a small acquisition in Laredo, Texas to transition 9000 members to the company, and it’s also partial payment of an acquisition in Florida as we transition members from HealthPass into our Florida HMO. 
Craig Silver – Private Investor:  You also had an increase in our intangibles for the year of over $20 million. Was that also acquisitions? 
Joseph White: Yes, the bulk of it being in Florida.
Craig Silver – Private Investor: You’re showing $21 million increase in intangibles, but our purchases of transactions is only $10.9 million.
Joseph White: There is an accounting twist to that. Essentially, the acquisition is being accomplished in stages, so we’ve essentially got a payable to the sellers in Florida recorded that’s not showing as an actual cash payment to them yet in the cash flow statement because we haven’t released those funds yet.
Craig Silver – Private Investor: Do we expect these acquisitions to improve our earnings substantially?
Joseph White: I think that the Florida acquisition is an ongoing process. It’s not a new thing that’s going to change things much. The acquisition in Texas is small, and I think that we’re doing that in conjunction with the expectation that we’ll be expanding through the Texas CHIP program in the fall of 2010 as a result of the RFP. 
Craig Silver – Private Investor: It’s very good that we’re continuing to flow cash. It’s good to see our cash balance grow. What’s the possibility of starting to see a dividend for shareholders? I think that would open up our stock to some more mutual funds that need income.
Joseph White: It’s something that’s been discussed in the past, but right now, I don’t anticipate a dividend in the near future.
Craig Silver – Private Investor: It would helpful for our shareholders and would certainly open our stock up to more funds that are looking for not just growth but for income. 
Joseph White:  In John and Mario, you’re talking to two of the largest shareholders in the company, and we would certainly benefit from a dividend, so we’re aware of that.
Craig Silver – Private Investor: You’re also benefiting from restricted share purchasing and other things that shareholders are not, so keep that in mind.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Tom Carroll – Stifel Nicolaus.
Tom Carroll – Stifel Nicolaus: This chart you have on page 5, the emergency room visits per 1000, that shows the change year over year in the different levels, if there is 100 ER visits in a year on a normalized basis, how many fit into each of those buckets, and what does this year look like?
John Molina: Normal conventional wisdom is a bell-shaped curve. For example, if you look at the American College of Emergency Physicians’ guidelines on this, a level 1 is a wound check, and a level 5 is a multi-system exam, so it’s really a bell-shaped curve. Most of this stuff falls in level 3, and so that’s why you can see why given the changes we’ve outlined in the table here, why it’s having an impact on our cost structure.  
Dr. Mario Molina:  The distribution is skewing to the higher codes, and this is a new phenomenon that we’re working on. It’s a little strange.
Tom Carroll – Stifel Nicolaus: Thank you.
Dr. Mario Molina: That concludes our call. Thank you for joining us, and we’ll speak to you at the end of the fourth quarter.

Operator:  Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen my name is Mohamed and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to Molina Healthcare’s Second Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder this conference is being recorded Tuesday August 4, 2009. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Juan José Orellana, Vice President of Investor Relations with Molina Healthcare. Please go ahead sir.  
Juan José Orellana: Thank you, Mohamed. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare's financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2009. The Company's earnings release reporting its results was issued today after the market closed and is now posted for viewing on our company website. On the call with me today are several members of our executive team; Dr. Mario Molina, our CEO; John Molina, our CFO; Terry Bayer, our COO; Dr. Michael Siegel, Vice President and Medical Director who is filling in today for Dr. Jim Howatt, who is not available today; and Joseph White, our Chief Accounting Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call and take your questions. I also would like to remind you that our comments today contain numerous forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions that are subject to numerous risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release, our 10-K annual report, and our 10-Q quarterly reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab of our company website or on the SEC's website. All forward-looking statements made during today's call represent our judgment as of August 4, 2009, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements. This call is being recorded, and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available over the Internet through the company's website at www.molinahealthcare.com.  I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina.
Dr. Mario Molina: Thank you Juan José and hello everyone. In my remarks today I will provide a brief overview of our second quarter performance and update you on the progress we have made in positioning Molina for improved long-term performance and growth. Dr. Mike Siegel will provide some commentary on the H1N1 outbreak and then John will provide greater details related to our second quarter financial results. After John’s remarks we will open the call to answer your questions.  By now I assume you have all had a chance to review our press release. Our earnings per share were $0.56. Our results for the second quarter can be summarized as mixed with several notable, positive developments offset by higher medical costs and continued pressure on premium rates. Higher medical costs and revenue pressure resulted in lower profit margins across some of our larger markets.  In reviewing our results it is important to focus on what has changed since the first quarter as well as what continue to be key factors affecting our short-term financial performance. We have experienced greater utilization of outpatient services, some of which we believe resulted from the H11 flu epidemic, a substantial increase in new membership in the first half of this year, and higher professional fees and outpatient facility cost trends. Some of the items we discuss during the first quarter continue to remain at issue; state budgets are still a problem; healthcare unit costs are on the rise, and interest rates remain low.  Let me share with you some of the progress that we have made. On the membership front today we reported membership of 1.37 million members, a 9% increase from December 2008. Excluding Florida membership has grown almost 7%. We are therefore well on our way to meeting our full year enrollment goal as shared with you in January. As we have stated in the past our historical organic growth rate has been in the range of 3% to 4%; however as we reminded everyone at our most recent Investor Day new members generally come with higher costs, at least initially. Our experience has been that new members typically incur higher medical costs during their first nine months of enrollment, but we have also observed that the utilization tends to stabilize over time.  We have some good news in the second quarter. I am pleased to announce our successful contract renewal in the state of Missouri. Molina Healthcare of Missouri was successful in retaining its existing business in the three regions we currently serve. I am also very pleased to announce our success in retaining our Medicaid contract in the state of Michigan. This new contract in Michigan will become effective October 1, 2009 and we will expand our service area in the state from 42 to 46 counties.  n addition, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission issued a tentative contract award to Molina Healthcare of Texas for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, in rural counties. The award, which covers up to 170 counties in Texas, is contingent upon the successful negotiation and execution of a contract with the state. The new contract has a tentative operational start date in September 2010. We are pleased to expand our contracting relationship with the state of Texas and look forward to providing greater access to quality healthcare services to the rural populations in that state. The New Mexico Retiree Healthcare Authority notified our New Mexico health plan that its Medicare product will be offered as an option to the state employee retiree group business. This new opportunity and our new contract in Texas further our strategic goal of diversifying along product and geographic lines while remaining true to our mission. I am also pleased to report that our Texas health plan earned accreditation from the National Committee on Quality Assurance. Molina Healthcare of Texas is the only Medicaid health plan in the state that has earned an accreditation from NCQA. Molina Healthcare continues to be among the leaders in healthcare quality with health plans in seven states accredited by NCQA in California, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, Utah, Washington, and now Texas. Currently only 22% of the nations Medicaid plans are accredited by NCQA. I want to offer my congratulations to the staff of our Texas health plan for his achievement.  In these challenging times we continue to manage our business for the long-term and are pleased with the progress we are making towards our strategic goals. We continue to expand in new and existing markets, we continue to leverage a lean administrative structure, and as always we remain intensely focused on quality. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Michael Siegel who will provide an update on the H1N1 virus. Dr. Siegel?
Michael Siegel, MD: Thank you Dr. Molina. Hello everyone. In early April a child in California was diagnosed with the novel H1N1 influenza viral infection. The new influenza strain has now reached pandemic levels. Currently in the United States there are over 43,000 documented cases. Sadly the infection has resulted in 302 deaths. It is thought that the H1N1 flu infection is far more prevalent than these statistics would suggest.  This summer we are continuing to see higher than normal numbers of influenza like cases caused by the novel H1N1 flu virus. Over the past several weeks there have been reports of children being sent home from overnight camps with flu like illnesses. Several of the children have tested positive for the novel H1N1 infection. These cases associated with increased physical proximity may foreshadow an increase in the number of novel H1N1 cases when children return to school next month; however at this time we do not know how much of a role this new virus will play in the approaching flu season. The disease attack rate is highest in persons under 25 years of age. This group constitutes a significant portion of our membership. We are closely following the progress and the development and distribution of a novel H1N1 vaccine. As of last week the CDC projects that there will be a vaccine available by mid-October. We are augmenting our seasonal flu prevention program with the following actions: We are increasing the level of member notifications both by mail and by interactive voice response outreach. We are also increasing our efforts in working with providers to reach high-risk patients. We are urging members to get their annual flu shot earlier than usual. We will be providing member and provider updates as more information becomes available. We are starting our own employee flu prevention education program now and plan for early worksite flu vaccinations. Finally, as Dr. Howatt said during the last earnings call all of us should keep in mind important behaviors that will help minimize the spread of the virus: wash your hands frequently; avoid touching your eyes, mouth, and nose; stay home when you or your family members are ill; avoid contact with ill people; cover coughs and sneezes; and practice good health habits including adequate rest and nutrition. Now I would like to turn the call over to John Molina.
John Molina J.D.: Thank you for that important update Dr. Siegel, and now to our financial results.  Results for the second quarter of 2009 were $0.56 per fully diluted share. Net income was $15 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 as compared to $16 million recorded for the quarter ended June 30, 2008. Our 2009 second quarter revenue increased 22% or $164 million when compared to the second quarter of 2008. As outlined in our press release today membership growth has been strong and we continue to generate administrative cost efficiencies. Unfortunately we have experienced significant cost pressures and medical margin pressure. In the long run we are confident that the benefits of increased membership will out weigh the challenges of higher medical costs. Since the beginning of the year the Company has grown by over 112,000 members. To put this in perspective, we have added more members in the first half of this year than the total enrollment at our Missouri and Texas health plans combined. Our medical care ratio increased from 84.2% in the second quarter of 2008 to 86.8% in the second quarter of 2009. This is an increase of 260 basis points year-over-year and a 70 basis point change for the prior quarter ended March 31, 2009.  As we have discussed in the past, the Company usually experiences a decline in medical costs in the second quarter; this was not the case during 2009. Higher utilization was responsible for higher medical costs. Contributing to the situation was the outbreak of the novel H1N1 virus and a higher utilization associated with newer members.  Although the first quarter of 2009 may have benefited from a lighter flu season the Company believes that the H1N1 flu outbreak was partially responsible for the absence of the usual seasonal drop in medical costs from the first to second quarters. The Company also suspects that the media attention on H1N1 may have driven more patients to seek care than would otherwise have been the case. Physician and outpatient costs exhibited the most unfavorable cost trend in the first half of 2009. Together these costs increased approximately 18% on a per member per month basis compared with the second quarter of 2008. Emergency room utilization was up approximately 8% and cost per visit was up approximately 13% were the primary drivers of increased costs during the first half of 2009. During the first half of 2009 we observed some providers billing at higher levels of care than in the first half of 2008. For example, the billing codes for emergency room level of care, which reflects the intensity of services provided in the emergency room, with level 1 being the least intensive and level 5 being the most intensive, changed significantly in the first half of 2009 compared to the first half of 2008. Level 1 visits decreased by 16% while level 2 visits decreased by 10%; however both level 3 and level 4 visits increased by 13% and level 5 visits increased by 18%. We have also seen an increase in physician office visits and preventive care services. Both inpatient and pharmacy costs increased approximately 4% per member per month year-over-year. Capitated costs increased approximately 11% PM PM year-over-year due to retroactive capitation payments in New Mexico and the transition of members in a capitated arrangement in California. Now I want to take some time to talk specifically about California and Washington.  California health plan results have adversely affected the Company’s current quarter and year-to-date results. Year-to-date California plans Medicaid medical margin has decreased by approximately $12 million when compared to the first half of 2008. Based upon claims paid through June of this year the Company estimates the claims reserves from the California health plan were under stated by approximately $5.2 million at December 31. 2008. This adverse claims development was partially offset by $3.2 million in revenue recognized by the California health plan in connection with a settlement of a rate dispute with the state for 2002. A reduction of about $9.00 per member per month in the Washington health plans premium rates have also affected the Company’s current quarter. This decrease in premiums was not fully offset by cuts to the Washington Medicaid provider fee schedule. We now know that only about 1/3 of the $9.00 PM PM revenue decrease is being offset by the change in the fee schedule. This resulted in a decline in medical margin of about $5.4 million for the quarter or $10.6 million for the first half of the year. The Company has taken a number of steps to improve profitability. We are reexamining our network strategy in California; furthermore we expect to receive rate increases in California of about 4.5% in the fourth quarter of 2009. The premium rate increases for the health plans in California were included in the State of California budget that was signed on July 28th. The cuts in the MediCal program in California do not affect the managed care contracts. We may experience a decrease in enrollment in the CHIP program due to changes in the state budget, but at this time we do not believe this will have a material impact on our financial results.  On July 1, 2009 the State of Washington lowered Medicaid premium rates by 7.5% to reflect reductions in the Medicaid fee schedule. Our analysis shows that the reduction in our medical costs will largely mirror the reduction in the premium rate. In addition, in Washington, we will exit the basic health plan contract in King County affective January 1, 2010. Based on claims paid through June 2009 we believe that our year-end claims reserve in 2008 was more than adequate; in fact, the benefit we report on our roll forward table is nearly the same as we reported at this time last year. The run out of the reserve we established on March 31, 2009 for the first quarter of this year has not been as favorable as in previous years. This had a negative impact on second quarter results as we replenished reserves to a more typical level.  We are pleased with our success in managing administrative costs. General and administrative expenses in the second quarter were 10.1% of total revenue, or $94 million, as compared to 11.4% of total revenue for the second quarter 2008, or $87 million. Core G&A expenses decreased nearly 120 basis points to 7% of total revenue for second quarter 2009 as compared to 8.2% for second quarter 2008. The decrease in core G&A compared with the second quarter of 2008 was primarily due to lower administrative payroll as a percentage of revenue. Core G&A expenses have also declined on a per member per month basis by approximately 6%, highlighting the administrative leverage resulting from higher enrollment levels. We continue to hold the line on our administrative costs as we grow the top line revenue. We view our administrative leverage as an additional cushion during times of pressure on premium rates. The effective income tax rate decreased to 16.8% in the quarter ended June 30, 2009 from 41% in June 30, 2008. The lower rate is primarily due to discrete tax benefits of $4.4 million recorded in the second quarter of 2009 as a result of settling tax examinations in the voluntary filing of certain accounting method changes. The Company’s tax rate would have been 43.5% for the quarter 2009 absent these discrete tax benefits. Cash flow provided by operating activities for six months ended June 30, 2009 increased substantially to $95 million compared with cash flow from operations totaling $39 million for the same period in 2008, an increase of $56 million. The increase was due mainly to two factors: first increase deferred revenue of approximately $45 million and second increased medical claims in benefits payable of approximately $22 million. These increases were partially offset by increased receivables of $21 million. We do not expect to [audio gap]. Excluding restricted investments the Company had cash and investments of approximately $660 million. The parent company had free cash and investments of approximately $30 million plus access to our untapped credit facility. The Company is revising its EPS guidance for fiscal year 2009 to $2.15 per diluted share. We have provided a number of metrics that go into the development of that guidance in our press release and we encourage you to review that document for additional detail.  As I am sure you have noticed, we have moved away from providing ranges for key metrics and have instead settled on single point measurements. I want to take a few moments to discuss this change. In the past we have provided a great deal of information with respect to premium revenue, investment income, EBITDA, medical costs, and administrative costs in order to help our investors and the analysts understand how we view the immediate future of our business. In the past we have given these inputs in terms of ranges. Many investors and some analysts have struggled with translating these ranges into a single point expectation of net income. Too often people will compile each input at the bottom of the range and assume that this will lead them to the bottom end of our EPS guidance range. Conversely they will assume that by compiling the top end of each input range they can build a figure that matches the top end of our EPS range. However, it is rarely the case that all the bad things will happen together and it is equally unlikely that all of the good things will happen together. We therefore decided to provide single points of reference in an attempt to provide greater clarity, which will allow our investors to make their own determinations as to the likelihood of the ultimate outcomes.  I would again urge you to review our press release for a very thorough disclosure of the important financial metrics that comprise our expectations for the balance of the year. While you can review the numeric inputs, let me describe some of the key issues facing our business in the second half of 2009. We do not expect enrollment to grow in the second half of the year as it did in the first half of this year. If enrollment gains are as large as they were in the first half we may continue to see elevated medical costs. Our revised guidance includes changes to individual health plan premium rates that were not anticipated when we first provided guidance in January. As you may recall, we did not expect to see substantial rate increases this year; however, as detailed in our earnings release we now believe we will get rate increases in some states, rate decreases in other states and oddly enough both increases and decreases, just timed differently, in a couple of states. For example, we would not have expected any rate increases in California but have found that the current budget did fund some of these increases effective October 1, 2009. Where we believe there is a greater chance than not that the rate changes will happen we have incorporated those changes into our guidance; however many states have fragile budgets. If the actual state tax receipts and stimulus dollars come in less than expected there is a chance that the state will delay the implementation of rate changes or actually decrease rates. We will not speculate where, when, and if rate changes will happen, but want you to understand that it is a possibility. We have often discussed seasonality with respect to our medical costs. Typically medical costs are highest in the first quarter, decrease in the second quarter, reach an aid year in the third quarter and rise in the fourth quarter. It is important to note that while costs rise in the fourth quarter, they are generally still below the costs incurred in the second quarter.  As we have discussed today we did not see the typical decline in medical costs in the second quarter. We have developed guidance to assume that medical costs will not follow typical patterns this year. We have projected a slight decrease in our medical care ratio for the second half of the year. Should we see a return to more normal seasonal patterns we would expect medical costs to decrease further thus earnings increase. On the other hand, we have not projected a virulent outbreak of H1N1 or other seasonal flu. If H1N1 returns with wide spread applicability our medical costs could rise beyond what we are anticipating and our earnings would go down. This concludes our prepared remarks. Mohamed, we are ready to take questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Joshua Raskin with Barclays Capital. 
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital : My question sort of relates to second half earnings run rate and the guidance here. The first quarter you guys reported $0.46, but there was really a $0.04 gain in there; this quarter is $0.56 but $0.18 from tax benefits, so excluding the tax benefit you get about $0.84, you are talking about $1.13 in the second half which seems like a pretty big ramp. You just talked about the muted seasonality expectation and I am actually calculating an MLR that’s about 40 basis or 45 basis points better on a year-over-year basis on the second half and the first half. So, I am just curious how you bridge from 1H09 to the second half of ’09.
John Molina J.D.: I think although it may simple to just exclude what might be 1x items, we don’t detail out every up and down potential change that may or may not reoccur. Certain things happen through out the quarter; we just draw your attention to a couple of them that sort of stick out. So, what I would say is in terms of the back half of the year we have given our best estimate of guidance of being $2.15 and so we expect to bridge the gap between where we are at the end of Q2 to get to $2.15.  
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital :  Maybe then I could ask it another way. It looks like the guidance implies a much better earnings run rate in the second half than the first half. I am just curious what some of those positive factors are that would lead to that?
John Molina J.D.: I think the rate increases are a big factor in that Josh. We didn’t have those in January.
Mario Molina M.D: We are also expecting some decrease in medical costs in the second half of the year and we are making some progress on the contracting front. So, there are a number of things that we think will lead the second half to be better than the first half.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital :  Okay and then just a follow up, could you walk us through the timing; it didn’t sound as bad, obviously, in the first quarter and it looks like you guys were still buying back stock in the second quarter so how did this sort of develop and what were some of the indicators and how comfortable are you that you sort of figured out what the new run rate is?
John Molina J.D.: Are you talking about the run rate on guidance, or the run rate on the repurchases?
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital : Medical costs, I’m sorry, how do you know you’ve got the right level of medical costs [inaudible].
John Molina J.D.: We pour through reams and reams of reports from our actuarial and our medical cost departments to make sure that we, as best as possible, understand what the underlying drivers for the cost and utilization data and that is something that just doesn’t stop. We are continuing to look at that continually.
Mario Molina M.D: There are a number of factors that went into this. The first, I think, is increased outpatient utilization. We have seen this, and I think that some of the other health plans that have reported have also commented on this. We think that there was some contribution from the H1N1 flu virus, but that doesn’t explain all of it. We have also seen in the past that new members come with higher costs in the first six to nine months and with the large influx of new members we think that contributed to the elevation in the costs. It was mostly outpatient; it was really not so much pharmacy or inpatient. So those are some of the main cost drivers that we have seen in the first half of the year. We think that there are some indications that costs will come down in the second half of the year and we have got some preliminary data from pharmacy that would suggest that the costs are coming down in July, and I think this is consistent with what some of the PBMs are reporting.  
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital :  Okay, we can follow up. Thank you. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Daryn Miller with Goldman Sachs. 
Daryn Miller - Goldman Sachs :  I have a question on the California budget. It looked like the amount that they were looking to cut out of MediCal was fairly significant. I am just wondering since a portion of that doesn’t seem like it’s coming from managed care. Where is that money going to come from?
Mario Molina M.D: The decreases in the MediCal budget are coming from a variety of sources, but what we can say that affects us is that there was budgeted a rate increase for the managed care plans. That remained in the budget and we have gotten rates that will be effective October 1st, which give us about a 4% to a 4.5% rate increase for the fourth quarter. So, we are very hopeful that that will remain, but as John pointed out the budgets are fragile, so for the time being we aren’t counting on that money. If anything changes we will let you know.
Daryn Miller - Goldman Sachs : Do you have any speculation in terms of what aspects of the program not related to managed care that would be trimmed to generate the savings?
Mario Molina M.D: I don’t want to get into that, since it really doesn’t affect our business.
Daryn Miller - Goldman Sachs : You said if they change the CHIP program the impact would be modest. Can you potentially size that aspect?
Mario Molina M.D: We think that we could lose 2,000 or 3,000 members this year, so we don’t think it’s going to have a significant impact on our financials for the remainder of 2009.
Joe White: Just to put that into perspective that’s about a $75.00 per member per month premium.
Daryn Miller - Goldman Sachs : Okay. Do you guys have any expectations, you are picking up a lot of new enrollment, what is the duration of that new enrollment do you think? Or, how long is it going to be around?
John Molina J.D.: We are seeing that one of the things that are driving increase in overall membership is that we are not losing as many members through out the back end as we are gaining coming in the door for the first time. I don’t know that we have done a complete duration study to see what the average length of enrollment has been. I would say to Mario’s point the medical costs seem to be elevated for the first six to nine months and then begin to lower, but I don’t know that we have sufficient data right now on total average monthly enrollment.
Mario Molina M.D: I think it is really too soon to tell. I mean some of these members have only come on this year, so it is hard for us to know. We will just have to see, but as John points out disenrollments are down and you would expect that in a difficult economy.
Daryn Miller - Goldman Sachs:
 : Yes, I guess maybe going back to previous downturns, because if we think about this maybe higher than expected costs up front, but if disenrollments stick around for two and a half or three and a half years there is potentially quite a bit of benefit on the back end. Are there any indications from previous downturns how long disenrollment might be around for?
Mario Molina M.D:  I think that you are right about the fact that there is some upside, the longer the members remain on the plan. But, to be honest, I don’t think we’ve had a downturn like this since the 1930’s, so it is a little bit difficult for us to go back and look for a comparable historical period.
Daryn Miller - Goldman Sachs : That’s fair. The trend that we are seeing on provider behavior seems to be pretty wide spread. Is there any common themes as in types of providers that are up coding or billing for more activities? Is there any theme or trend on those types of providers?
John Molina J.D.: We did see, as an example that I cited, some of the ER providers, but right now I don’t think we know enough to ascribe broad patterns or trends.
Mario Molina M.D: I will tell you anecdotally that I periodically get emails inviting me to seminars on coding. So, I don’t know if this is an industry trend or if this is just a blip that reflects the current state of the economy.
Daryn Miller - Goldman Sachs : Okay, thank you very much guys.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Gregory Nersessian from Credit Suisse. 
Gregory Nersessian - Credit Suisse :  I have a couple of questions on some of the specific items you outlined in the press release. The New Mexico capitation expense increase, were both the retroactive premium revenue and the costs all booked this quarter; so it was a net benefit from that item this quarter?
Joe White: Yes, it is. 
Gregory Nersessian - Credit Suisse : Okay, so that was about a $3 $3.5 million net benefit this quarter?
Joe White: I think out of period was about $2.5, yes.
Gregory Nersessian - Credit Suisse : Okay and the California, I understand that you had negative reserve development within that health plan, but it looked like your aggregate prior period reserve development was basically in line. Is that a fair characterization at the consolidated level?
Mario Molina M.D: At the consolidated level as of the end of last year, yes.
Gregory Nersessian - Credit Suisse : Okay, so is it fair then to sort of look at that $3.2 million in revenue as sort of a 1-x item, the deferred revenue going back to 2002?
Mario Molina M.D: Yes.
Gregory Nersessian - Credit Suisse : Then I guess the swine flu data that I have looked at from the CDC suggests that it is mostly kind of been a Northeast phenomenon. I was wondering if you could spike out which markets you are seeing that in a more pronounced way. Are there any specific states where it has become more prevalent?
Michael Siegel, MD: Reviewing the surveillance report from the CDC from last Friday there is wide spread activity in California, regional activity in Washington and Florida and then lesser degrees of activity in the rest of the Molina states.
Gregory Nersessian - Credit Suisse : So California is getting materially worse is that how you would characterize it in terms of the [interposing].
Michael Siegel, MD: Yes for the reports submitted to the CDC.
Gregory Nersessian - Credit Suisse : Okay and on the California rate increase, the 4.5%, does that all accrue to you, or are there some provider payment changes underneath that that would mitigate some of that rate increase?
Michael Siegel, MD: The only provider payment that might negate is we have a contract with Health Net for the Inland Empire that mirrors the one we have in L.A. so we have to pass some of that through to them, but it is a very small amount. 
Mario Molina M.D: So basically the answer to that is no Greg.
Gregory Nersessian - Credit Suisse : So you are getting almost the full effect of that 4.5%.
Mario Molina M.D: Yes, as long as it stays.
Gregory Nersessian - Credit Suisse : Okay and then any changes to your approach to reserves? The days dropped a couple of days in the quarter. Was there any reserve strengthening you could speak to in the quarter, or maybe you could just give us some color commentary on how you approach the reserves given the unexpected spike?
Joe White: I think it is fair to say you mentioned 12/31/08 reserve development a minute ago. We talk in the release and we even have a table in the back end. The 03/31/09 reserve was comparatively light, when we set that at the end of the last quarter, so we have had to make up some ground on that this year. If you look at the roll forward tables specific to the 03/31/09 reserve you will see that the benefit hitting us in the second quarter was only $26 million, when we probably normally expected something in the $40 million range. So, certainly we have had to strengthen for that. On the other side we resumed our large downward in terms of the inventory numbers. They are down about 17% from the second quarter; so we feel like we caught up with what happened in the first and second quarters and obviously a little bit of the negative impact, a little bit of the negative cost trends we’re seeing in Q2 obviously should spill over into Q1 if we’d se the reserves a little bit more consistently back in March. 
John Molina J.D.: The bottom line is we have not changed our methodology for reserving and in fact we are not allowed to pad the reserves in the expectation of something bad might happen in the future. Our reserves are set on all of the information we know at the time we set the reserves at the end of a period.
Gregory Nersessian - Credit Suisse : All right, okay, thank you.
Operator:  (Operator instructions). Your next question comes from Thomas Carroll with Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc. 
Thomas Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc. :  I want to drill down a little more, pick up on Greg’s question a bit, related to the 1-x items and then how that translates into the back half of your year. So you are putting up a $0.56 quarter here, I am taking out $0.08 a share for the California settlement, about $0.27 for the tax benefit and another $0.08 for the difference in the New Mexico retro payments and then adding back the negative development in California which is about $0.06; so, you put that all together and you’re getting to like a $0.29 or $0.30 quarter. Is that going to then turn into a $0.56 quarter on third quarter because of lower medical expenses? Could you help me out with the math there and please point out where I am wrong?
John Molina J.D.: Again, what I would say is there are other 1-x items that just for the sake of brevity we did not include. Let me give you an example. We had an additional $2 million expense in the quarter related to New Mexico insurance pool premium pools. We didn’t detail that out. There is probably another $0.5 million somewhere else, and then another $1 million somewhere else. We just don’t detail them all. They go back and forth all of the time because we have got a complex business, I mean we are talking about nine health plans and several hundreds of millions of dollars worth of revenue and expenses going through. What I would say is the end of the year number is our best estimate taking everything into consideration, medical costs, adding in expenses, investment income, plus those changes that occur that are seen and frankly sometimes that are unseen because they are just too small or numerous to put in place, or to detail out.
Thomas Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc. : But you would suggest these three things that you highlighted are probably non-recurring in nature, is that correct?
John Molina J.D.: Yes.
Thomas Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc. : I mean you are not going to get another California, I guess you could get another California tax settlement next quarter, but you are not expecting one?
Mario Molina M.D: We do have other disputes on rates with the state of California, but no Tom we are not expecting any settlement in the near future.
Thomas Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc. : All right, the one other question I had for you back to some of the text in your press release about, I believe it was the Washington state market where you were getting the $9.00 PM PM lower amount that you thought was going to be mostly passed through in lower fee schedule numbers that is not being all the way accounted for. Is that a trend that perhaps we might see in other states and not just with you guys, but in any particular market where a rate, a fee schedule comes down, it is translated to a Medicaid HMO cap payment then ultimately doesn’t work out the way we think?
John Molina J.D.: We can’t speculate on what’s going to happen with other states. It happened in Washington. When they did the subsequent rate decrease in July and we looked at the data provided by the state to see how they determined the decrease and we feel that the fee schedule adequately covers the decrease in our premiums so that our costs should go down a commensurate level.
Mario Molina M.D:  I want to add a little bit to that. A lot of times when the states are calculating their rates they come up with certain assumptions and it is an aggregate across all health plans. Sometimes you will see differences between health plans within a state depending on things like utilization patterns and case mix; so, it can vary. You can see this kind of thing when rates are readjusted. If the actuaries for the state have done their job properly these things should be neutral and as John points out we think the next cut that they have made to the fee schedule should be neutral to us. We always examine these things, but it is difficult to be 100% sure. 
Thomas Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc. : So you don’t think that phenomenon, if you will, is going to continue July 1, ’09 through the remainder of the Washington contract period?
Mario Molina M.D:  I think generally the states are getting better in terms of the actuarial requirement and setting the rates properly.
Thomas Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc. : Okay thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Carl Mcdonald from Oppenheimer & Co. 
Carl Mcdonald - Oppenheimer & Co. :  I would be interested to know if you think there is any specific initiatives you can do, particularly thinking around the physician and outpatient costs. So if you take the emergency room data that you cited, is there anything that you can do from your end to try to bring the levels back down to what you have seen historically, or is that something that just sort of plays out on its own?
Mario Molina M.D: Yes, I think there are things that we can do and we are really trying to get after the outpatient costs. One of the things that we are trying to do is get more people to use the nurse advice line and triage patients that don’t need to go to the emergency room to urgent care centers. A lot of this is educational. Remember, we had 112,000 new members on the plan this year and it takes time to change people’s habits and behavior. We are also looking at opening up perhaps some other clinics in other areas to catch some of this over flow from the emergency rooms and redirect people away from the higher cost facilities. The other thing that I think we need to do is examine the records to see if this is simply a matter of up coding or if people are sicker and going to the ER, and then finally as I think Mike pointed our, or maybe it was John, there is some concern that the media promoted some of this because people were panicking over the flu and they heard about patients dying; so, people that had colds that might otherwise have stayed home and said it is a bad cold either went to their doctor or went to the emergency room and that increased utilization. On a positive side I think we saw an increase in preventive care services and that is something we have been trying to encourage which should benefit us on our HEDA scores. In the re-procurement of the Michigan contract there was 125 point total per county and if you look at the scores that we got you will see that we received the full 60 points for the quality points and we were the only health plan to get all five of the value added points; so right there our efforts in terms of improving our quality and HEDA scores is helping us with our contract renewal, and I think that is the kind of thing that we’ll see more of in the future with RFPs from the states on Medicaid contracts. 
Carl Mcdonald - Oppenheimer & Co.: Just beyond that Michigan contract when you look at the counties where you were added and the other counties where you were taken away, and the same thing with the competitors, will there be any significant shifts in the membership?
Mario Molina M.D: It is hard to say if there are going to be big shifts in the membership, but we think there is definitely some upside potential for us. We have some competitors that lost some counties and so we will have fewer competitors in some of the counties. At the same time I think we have added some counties, so there may be some upside there. We will just have to see how it plays out. But, I also think that our HEDA scores which helped drive the enrollment algorhythm in Michigan are definitely going to move us up in the enrollment algorhythm. In some of the counties we have been at tier 3 and we are now moving up to tier 1. 
Carl Mcdonald - Oppenheimer & Co.:  Great, thank you.
Operator:  Your final question comes from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank Securities. 
Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank Securities : My first question is back to medical costs. I am interested in how utilization looked for your existing membership, maybe the longer tenured membership as compared to the newer membership where clearly there were higher costs there. I guess thinking about utilization on the longer membership did you see an increase there too, and maybe if you parsed out swine flu just sort of a secular increase on the longer tenure membership?
Mario Molina M.D: It is a little bit difficult to tease that out, especially at this point, but we have done a couple of studies and it does vary a little bit from state to state, but there are some clear trends. One of the most pronounced trends is in California where we see that the members definitely have higher utilization and the break point comes at about nine months. To the extent that we can retain members beyond nine months their costs do come down and we should get some benefit from that. But, at this point it would be a little bit premature to break out the new members we received in 2009 versus the longer existing members. Do you follow me?
Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank Securities : Yes, yes I do. I have a second question on the exit from King County in Washington and to match for January, how many members will be impacted by that or how many members do you have enrolled in that county currently?
Terry Bayer: It is 10,000 members in the basic health contract that we are exiting. 
Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank Securities : Then on the commentary that you had on the tax benefits in the quarter, you had referenced a couple of changes to voluntary accounting methods. Joe, could you give us some details on exactly what changes you made in the accounting methods there?
Joe White: Sure. The biggest item was a settle up of a purchase accounting issue which per FAS 141R results from an income, from a tax perspective, results in a P&L impact. Of the $4.4 million that was about $3.5 million in the benefit. The remaining $900,000 of the benefit related to changes in terms of accounting practices and the biggest one was we now file as an insurance company. So between that and a few other small items we picked up about $900 K of benefit from accrued interest relates to those tax positions. 
Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank Securities : Okay, thank you. 
Operator:  Sir, I will now turn the call back over to you. Please continue with your presentation or your closing remarks. 
Mario Molina M.D:  I will close by saying thank you for joining us and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation. (Operator Instructions)

I also would like to remind you that our comments today contain numerous forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions that are subject to numerous risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release, our 10-K annual report, and our 10-Q quarterly reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab of our company website or on the SEC's website. All forward-looking statements made during today's call represent our judgment as of April 29, 2009, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements. This call is being recorded, and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available over the Internet through the company's website at www.molinahealthcare.com. I would also like to take a minute to point out a few changes to our investor relations activities for the remainder of 2009. Although healthcare conferences represent a great opportunity to interact with the investment community, our time with investors during such conferences is limited, and the scope of topics that we can cover about our company is narrow. Given these dynamics, we will be cutting back on the number of conferences that Molina will attend for the remainder of the year. However, this does not mean that the company will be limiting its interaction or communications with the investment community.  We remain committed to transparency and to access to management and as an alternative, we will be supplementing our attendance at such conferences by implementing a second investor day this year. We believe this will provide an enhanced opportunity to get to know our company better. The date for our second investor day has been set for May 28, 2009, in New York City. More details will be shared with you in the upcoming days. We look forward to seeing you there.  I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina.
Dr. Mario Molina: Hello everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to report another quarter of solid financial results. Highlights from the first quarter include diluted EPS of $0.46 versus $0.44 a year ago, membership that grew by 10% when compared to the first quarter of 2008, and also premium revenues that increased by 18% year over year. Our first quarter results exceeded consensus expectations and are clearly a positive towards our financial objectives for the full year. John will review the details of our financial performance in a few minutes, but needless to day, this was a good quarter under any circumstances, but especially when you consider the environment we’re dealing with today. Rising unemployment is expected to increase the number of people eligible for Medicaid. While this growth in the number of Medicaid beneficiaries represents a tailwind for our business, it must be weighed within the context of state budgetary constraints, rising medical costs, and lower interest rates, all of which can have the short-term effect of shrinking margins. However, I believe that one of the keys to delivering the type of results we published today even in a challenging economic environment is the focus of our team. Throughout the first quarter, our team has maintained its focus on building on the momentum from 2008, while the positioning the company for success in 2009 and beyond. We remain committed to be prudent stewards of public funds, a hallmark of our company, to managing our medical costs and to improving our capital allocation. All of these efforts relate back to our basic strategy, and we’re very pleased with the outcomes. Our management efforts have resulted in a strong core business. Except for California, most of our health plans performed well in the first quarter of 2009. We’re encouraged by the progress of our Ohio health plan, and we’re confident that the efforts that led to the improvement in Ohio can be replicated in California.  You may recall that inadequate premium rates, rising unit costs, and high utilization due to pent-up demand in Ohio resulted in a drag to our earnings throughout 2008, but starting last year, around the third quarter, our contracting efforts produced new contracts with significant savings. Furthermore, through extended conversations with the state, we’ve been able to document the need for rate increases. Our approach was successful, and our Ohio health plan received a 5% rate increase effective January 1, 2009. As a result of getting improved rates from the state, our contracting efforts, and by managing utilization, the medical care ratio in Ohio declined by 600 basis points from a year ago.  Our founder, Dr. David Molina, said this is a business of nickels. By this, he meant that we must pay attention to detail. We strive to provide quality healthcare at a low cost. Our Ohio plan has done just that—lowering costs while upholding high standards of care. In seeking to meet the demands of an evolving marketplace while improving the cost effectiveness and care in Ohio, I’m pleased to report that we have always kept our focus on quality healthcare. Molina embraces the philosophy that quality healthcare and cost effectiveness need not be mutually exclusive, and we’re especially proud that our focus on quality in Ohio has attracted national attention. During the first quarter of 2009, Molina Healthcare of Ohio met the rigorous accreditation standards established by the National Committee for Quality Assurance, and earned a 3-year new health plan accreditation from NCQA. I want to thank everyone at the Ohio Health Plan for their hard work and dedication leading to this achievement.  In California, low premium rate increases, higher unit costs, and pent-up demand among new members resulted in medical cost trends that exceeded premium growth. The challenges in California are neither new, nor entirely unanticipated. Some California providers have responded to the current economic conditions in the state by increasing their bill charges, or in the case of a handful of providers that are essential to our network demanding steep rates in order to participate in our network. We are working diligently to address these challenges.  I want to highlight the good results that we’re seeing across some of our other state health plans. Michigan, Missouri, Texas, Washington, and Utah have been performing well. Medical margin, which is the difference between premium revenue and medical costs and also represents a measure of the efficiency of healthcare delivery increased by 16% over the first quarter of last year. We’re pleased to see that our diversification strategy is working.  As we shared with you during our investor day, we believe that during these difficult times, Medicaid managed care is a proven and compelling solution to covering the uninsured and alleviating states’ rising Medicaid budgets. Serving the healthcare needs of vulnerable populations is not for every company. It requires a real understanding of this population and a depth of expertise to make a difference in patients’ lives. It is in our experience, cultural orientation and nearly 30 years of experience in Medicaid managed care that allow us to flourish in this challenging environment. We remain optimistic about the long-term growth potential of our business, and I look forward to seeing you at our investor day next month. I would now like to turn the call over to John now. 
John Molina: As Mario noted, we’re pleased with our first quarter results. Net income of $12.2 million was only slightly less than last year’s $12.5 million. Earnings per share actually increased to $0.46 per share from $0.44 per share. We owe this success to increased enrollment, careful capital management, and tight administrative cost control. It is worth nothing that if investment income had not fallen by about $4 million between Q1 of 2008 and Q1 of 2009, EPS would have been another $0.09 higher this quarter. This means the results from our underlying operations are stronger this year than they were a year ago.  Enrollment grew by 2.4% between December and March even without the benefit of our Florida market entry. This enrollment growth which was consistent with our announced guidance for 2009 enabled us to overcome a slight increase in our medical care ratio compared to 2008. Even with the slight increase in our medical care ratio, we were able to grow our medical margin by 16% year over year.  We took advantage of equity market conditions to continue the repurchase of both our common shares and our senior convertible debt. This focus on capital allocation allowed us to increase earnings per share in the first quarter despite the $3.9 million decrease in investment income I mentioned a minute ago.  Finally, tight control of administrative costs again consistent with our announced guidance for 2009 allowed us to leverage our enrollment growth and reduce our core general and administrative expenses to 7.6% of total revenue. Nearly all of our health plans—Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Texas, Utah, and Washington—performed well. The improvement at our Ohio health plan is particularly satisfying. That improvement represents the culmination of three years of efforts to bring both effective and cost-efficient health care to members there.  We’re especially pleased to have demonstrated both economic efficiency and care quality during the same quarter. The first quarter financial results we’re discussing for Ohio today are more meaningful because we achieved accreditation from the National Committee for Quality Assurance.  While we face challenges in California, we continue to believe our presence there will prove to be a strategic advantage over the long run. California has the largest Medicaid population of any state in the nation and is second in the nation in annual Medicaid expenditures. We will maintain the same focus on quality and efficiency in California as we have in Ohio and our other markets. We believe that over time changes in provider contracting, utilization management, administrative efficiency, collaboration with state agencies, and a constant focus on quality will lead to success in California, just as they have done in Ohio. Cash flow provided by operating activities for the quarter ended March 21, 2009, was $67 million, compared with cash used by operating activities totaling $23 million for the same period in 2008—an improvement of $90 million. The increase was due primarily to two factors. First, we had a $91 million favorable change in deferred revenue in Ohio. Secondly, medical claims and benefits payable increased by approximately $19 million. These increases were offset increased receivables of approximately $24 million, primarily in California and Utah.  At March 31, 2009, the company had cash and investments of approximately $707 million. At March 31, 2009, our parent company had cash and investments of approximately $70 million. Cash and investments at the parent company were up slightly from December 31, 2008, despite the repurchase of nearly $25 million in common stock and senior convertible notes during the quarter. Given our strong cash position, our board has authorized management to buy additional shares and convertible bonds back. Days in claims payable increased sequentially to 42 days at March 31, 2009, up from 41 days at December 31, 2008. We are confirming our guidance issued on January 22, 2009, of earnings per diluted share between $2.20 and $2.40 for the full year of 2009.  Finally, I want to take a moment to remind everyone of the changes in our investor relations activities that Juan José discussed at the beginning of the call. We look forward to seeing at your investor day in New York next month. I will now turn the call over Dr. Jim Howatt who’ll be making some remarks related to the recent flu outbreak.
Dr. James Howatt: Molina Healthcare is closely following the developing situation around a possible flu pandemic and actively taking steps so that we are fully prepared for whatever may develop. As you’re likely aware, there has been international spread of a new and unique flu strain that appears to have first emerged in Mexico. With over 150 deaths reported thus far, the strain clearly has lethal potential. We’re preparing in two ways—one way with regards to our members and one way in regards to our personnel.  First, we’re working closely with public health agencies in the spirit of cooperation and collaboration that will lead to the most effective intervention. All our state plans are reviewing their programs to ensure access to care and pharmaceuticals as appropriate should this outbreak progress. In addition, we’re working to ensure business continuity in an environment where a significant portion of our workforce may fall ill, be absent for their positions, caring for ill family members, or asked to stay home as part of a strategy of social distancing.  The work we’ve done previously in the face of the threat from avian flu we believe will greatly assist us in our current preparations. The overall likely impact on our health costs from this virus is currently uncertain. There are two antiviral medications, Tamiflu and Relenza which appear to be effective against the virus. Vaccines are also being developed. Cost to treat and eventually vaccinate against the flu will likely be substantial and will probably be borne in part by government programs.  Molina Healthcare is prepared to be an active participant and partner to the overall healthcare systems of the states in which we manage care for our members. All of us should keep in mind the important behaviors that will help minimize the spread of the virus—wash hands frequently, avoid touching eyes, mouth, and nose, stay home when you or family members are ill, avoid contact with ill people, cover coughs and sneezes, and practice good health habits including adequate rest and nutrition.  This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. 
Operator: (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Tom Carroll – Stifel Nicolaus.
Tom Carroll – Stifel Nicolaus: I wondered if you could give us a little more commentary on the ABD program in Ohio that saw the sizeable sequential drop in the medical loss ratio. A competitor of yours in the same market had a similar drop, and I’m wondering if there was a sizeable possible development in the quarter or something else that you could maybe tell us a little bit more about.
John Molina: No, Tom. It wasn’t a sizeable development. I think the ABD is where we had probably the biggest swings in terms of some of the contracting efforts. Also, as you recall, last year we brought the behavior health in house, and the majority of those costs were for the ABD population.
Terry Bayer:   Tom, I’ll just add that our ABD enrollment grew toward the latter part of last year. We had members new for the first time, and as we implemented our program, some of those costs came out, but our contract renegotiation and our medical management efforts were really across both product lines.
Tom Carroll – Stifel Nicolaus: Secondly, could you maybe give us some comment on your reserving practices, which will probably be a similar conversation like we had in the past, but it’s just been a topic of discussion recently with Molina.
Dr. Mario Molina: Reserving methods haven’t changed, Tom.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Raskin – Barclays Capital.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays Capital:   With Florida, how are you accruing medical expenses now that you’re live on risk basis there?
Joseph White: Like we’ve talked about before, we’re just accruing those at 90% of premium until the claims have had time to develop.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays Capital: I noticed there was a slight deviation from that. That was the only reason I asked. Is there something in the math that makes that…
Joseph White: Yes. It’s just the way the math worked out frankly. No real change in facts as we know them.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays Capital: The $0.04 gain in the quarter, is that now included in the guidance and should we think about there being some 4-cent offset adverse with California or something, or should we just think about, look, we’ve got a 20-cent range, it’s 4 cents. Maybe we’ll be towards the higher end now or something like that?
John Molina: You hit the nail on the head Josh. That’s exactly why we give a pretty broad range.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays Capital: So, not necessarily will be towards the high end, but rather that’s why we give a big range?
John Molina: That’s correct. The latter part, and that’s why we give a high range. We’re not going to adjust guidance or pull anything out or put in anything back right now.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays Capital: On California, obviously it’s a challenge there, and I guess I’m just curious in light of the heightened MLR, the prospect that isn’t particularly great from a budget perspective there, is the plan profitable, and then in terms of remediation, you guys are really patient I think in Ohio, and that’s clearly shown benefits this year, but is this sort of a 3-year plan to get it to adequate margins? Is that a reasonable timeframe, or can things be done quicker there? I know obviously you have a lot more infrastructure there.
Dr. Mario Molina: Well, we’re certainly hoping that things will turn around in California more quickly than 3 years. We have benefited from the experience in Ohio, and we’re taking a similar approach in California, and it’s really a combination of things. We need to work with the state on the premium rates. We need to be more selective in our contracting, and we need to continue working on utilization of services, and it’s pretty straight forward. Part of this came about because we have not gotten, I don’t think, the rate increases that we really needed given the rising medical costs in California, so that has had an effect on the margins. 
Joshua Raskin – Barclays Capital: Maybe I’ll ask you in a different way, Mario. How patient are you going to be with the state?
Dr. Mario Molina: Well, as we pointed out, California is the largest Medicaid market in the country in terms of numbers. It’s the second largest in terms of dollars, and so we think that this is a very important market for us to be in.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Rex – J.P. Morgan.
John Rex – J.P. Morgan: On the Washington, I know you had a couple of rate cuts there in the 1Q, but MCR held in very steady. Anything going on there? In particular, shouldn’t we expect that to be trending up here in light of the rate cuts at some point?
John Molina: John, I think part of the rate cut was based on some provider cuts that flowed through, so I wouldn’t expect it to trend up too much.
Joseph White: I would just add remember that that rate cut came in two steps—1% on January 1, another roughly 2.5% which was as John mentioned partly offset by provider cuts on February 1, so these financials don’t show the full impact of the cuts yet.
John Rex – J.P. Morgan: Are you suggesting also that the flow through was aligned in terms of the rate decrease actuarially reflected, so that there was complete pass through to providers?
Joseph White: John, it’s not going to be complete pass-through, but we’re trying to take other efforts to mitigate looking at utilization, looking at provider contracts to see where we can maximize the provider contracts and have most favorable rates to us.  
John Molina: Also John, let me just add that two other things that we’re working on in terms of medical management this year that Jim has been talking a lot about is our effort to decrease readmissions on the DRGs and our continuing work on lowering emergency room utilization. 
John Rex – J.P. Morgan: On the Florida startup, just maybe some commentary on how that’s going. At the investor day I think you said you were 23,000 a couple of months ago, and I think you ended the quarter at 17 or something like that, and I guess we had been looking for it to maybe actually grow. Just a little commentary on that maybe.
Terry Bayer: Let’s talk about it in two parts—the first is that you’ll see that we have experienced a drop in that initial enrollment. Most of that is attributed to members switching back to the fee for service provider side which is still in place, because the managed care is not mandatory at this time, but secondly, we’re still rolling in the other counties, so we expect to still achieve the year-end target that we projected as these counties roll in, but initially we did see a drop by those transferring back into the fee for service program.
John Rex – J.P. Morgan: So what would’ve been your gross add in the quarter to think about what kind of retention you’re having as you bring them in?
John Molina: It’s difficult to say because it’s really too soon for us to know what the overall attrition rate is going to be.
John Rex – J.P. Morgan: I was wondering maybe if we started at 23 in January and would have been 35, so like essentially opted out of the system or so roughly.
John Molina: It depends a lot on how the rollover goes, and we’re still in that process, so until we get to a more stable point where all the members have been transferred over as we go into more counties, it’s really too soon to say.
Terry Bayer: And I’ll give you one other variable. These are different geographic areas that are rolling in, so the initial area was Dade County, but as we move on to the other counties, that could have a completely different percentage in relation to the providers in the network, the attitude of the members, etc., so it’s really difficult to predict.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Bowers – Deutsche Bank.
Justin Bowers – Deutsche Bank:   I was just curious if you could give us a sense of how your enrollment has progressed since quarter end just given that the economy does seem to be weakening a little bit and if you’re seeing a noticeable pick-up in any states.
John Molina: All I would say at this point is that the enrollment growth is consistent with the guidance we provided, and we remain on track. 
Justin Bowers – Deutsche Bank: Relative to Florida, do you have a target for you enrollment there for year end?
Joseph White: The target is 50,000. 
Justin Bowers – Deutsche Bank: DCPs and claims inventory were up sequentially. Should we think about 42 or 40 as a floor? Have you pretty much bottomed out there?
Joseph White: I think it’s probably fair to say that the DCP is going to hand around where it’s at right now. We closed the quarter at 42. It’s not going to get up much or very far below that number, barring something unforeseen. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carl Mcdonald – Oppenheimer.
Carl Mcdonald – Oppenheimer:   Just wanted to check to see if you had an updated view in terms of the impact of new membership. It may still be a little bit early in terms of actually seeing those members joining the plan, but there was the question in some prior quarters in terms of where there’d be an increased amount of utilization initially.
John Molina: I think it’s probably too early to tell. Traditionally, new members tend to have higher utilization, higher costs, and then they go down after about 2 quarters, the compacting factor of it being the first quarter where seasonality suggests that utilization was higher than normal anyways, so it’s a bit early to tell.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Darren Miller – Goldman Sachs.
Darren Miller – Goldman Sachs:   I have a question on the Ohio MCR. Given the seasonality we typically see in the first quarter, do you think we can actually see some improvement in the MCR going into the second and third quarter?
Dr. Mario Molina: We hate to peg the MCRs, Darren. It’s going to be a functioning of maintaining good utilization management and then ensuring that we direct the patients to the most cost effective providers.
Joseph White: The other that makes it difficult is that we haven’t really had a stable population. I mean over the past year we had a lot of new patients being rolled in, so we’re finally I think reaching a stable equilibrium where we can begin to see what the seasonal trends look like in Ohio. 
Daryn Miller – Goldman Sachs: Question on SG&A leverage. How much more improvement do you guys think you can see there?
Dr. Mario Molina: If you go back to our first investor day, we had discussed having about a 10% “organic growth” and bringing our admin down to about 7.5%, and for this quarter, we’re 7.6%, so we’re right on around where we want to be.
Daryn Miller – Goldman Sachs: Expectations in terms of picking up any SCHIP enrollment, what states do you think you have the best opportunity to get some of that enrollment and have you gotten anything so far?
Dr. Mario Molina: Well, California is the state that has the biggest SCHIP population for us. In some states such as New Mexico and Ohio, the SCHIP is sort of buried within the Medicaid, so you really don’t see it separated it out. We think we are well positioned in all the states that we’re in to pick up additional membership as it comes on.
Daryn Miller – Goldman Sachs: What states do you think are going to come on sooner or first?
John Molina: I don’t think you can say that there is any one state that’s more likely than the others. I think the program is nationwide. The economic downturn is affecting all states, and part of this will depend on state’s willingness to invest more money in the CHIP program because it is matching program.
Daryn Miller – Goldman Sachs: Can you just remind me where we are in terms of your rate activity and what were the last changes that were made in California rates?
Terry Bayer: As we shared with you at our investor day in January, there have really been no changes since then. We took a rate reduction in Los Angeles in October ’08. That continues through October ’09. Riverside, San Bernardino, and then San Diego had increases in October ’08 and back in 07/08, and our Sacramento rate increase is still pending, so no change from January 22nd.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Nersessian with Credit Suisse.
Greg Nersessian – Credit Suisse: I just had one on the Michigan and Missouri RFPs. Could you just give us an update on the timing in both of those states, maybe any changes that either of those states are considering and your view on whether or not you see that as an opportunity to take share, status quo, or perhaps lose share in each of those states.
Terry Bayer:  I’ll start with the facts of submissions, and then others may want to comment. In Missouri, we are awaiting news of the results of that RFP. It has been submitted, and we’ve returned comments. We are confident that as an incumbent we’ll continue, but we’ll know about that shortly, and the Michigan RFP is in process. We’re in the process of putting together a response, and that’ll be for an October 1 effective date as is Missouri for an October 1 effective date.
Dr. Mario Molina: There are no big programmatic changes that should effect enrollment significantly.
Greg Nersessian – Credit Suisse:  Any sense on the number of other bidders or any new market entrance going after those?
Dr. Mario Molina: We’re not seeing anything, but that doesn’t mean that there won’t be.  
Greg Nersessian – Credit Suisse:  Any other rate activity going on either in Michigan or any of your other states worth highlighting? 
John Molina:  I don’t think there been any change since the investor day in January. No new news.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Perry with Wachovia Capital Markets.
Matt Perry – Wachovia Capital Markets: At some point in ’09 as a lot of people who have lost their jobs may begin to qualify for Medicaid programs in various states, is this a population when they may enroll in your plan, would expect their behavior and utilization patterns to be very similar to your current membership or would there be any reason why they might utilize more or less services?
Dr. Mario Molina: I think going back to what John said earlier, we typically see higher utilization in the first 6 months on the plan, pretty much regardless of the A category, so we don’t think that the pattern of utilization is really going to change, and we think that we are already seeing that because we’ve seen growth in 2008, which is continuing in 2009 consistent with the downturn in the economy and the increase in the number of Medicaid beneficiaries.
Matt Perry – Wachovia Capital Markets: I know the Medicaid population has little or no cost sharing or co-pays, but is there any recession-related changes you’d expect in your current membership’s behavior patterns at all?
Dr. Mario Molina: No.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your next question is a followup from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel Nicolaus.
Tom Carroll – Stifel Nicolaus:  A quick followup related to Greg’s question as well. Did you guys evaluate the Mississippi RFP looking at the chronically ill population at all?
John Molina: You know, Tom, it is our practice not to comment on potential growth opportunities whether they be new RFPs or acquisitions. 
Tom Carroll – Stifel Nicolaus:  Secondly, you guys are in Texas, not one of your biggest markets, but did you see or have you been able to tease out any higher level of claim activity related to the flu given the high prevalence of the flu in Texas this year? 
Joseph White:  Nothing that we’re aware of. Nothing we’ve come across. No.
Operator:  Mr. Molina, there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to you. 
Dr. Mario Molina:  Thank you very much. We appreciate you participating on our call, and we look forward to seeing you at our next investor day in May in New York.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today’s conference call. We thank you for your participation, and we ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Molina Healthcare Year-End Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, February 11, 2009. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Juan Jose Orellana, Vice President of Investor Relations with Molina Healthcare.
Juan Jose Orellana: Thank you, Mohamed. Hello everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare’s financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2008. The Company’s earnings release reporting its results was issued today after the market close, and is now posted for viewing on our Company website. We would also like to thank those of you who attended our Investor Day in New York City on January 22, or listened to a webcast of the conference. For those who have not done so already, we encourage you to listen to the webcast, as we covered a variety of topics, including a detailed review of our 2009 outlook during our management presentations. On the call with me today are several members of our executive team, Dr. Mario Molina, our Chief Executive Officer; John Molina, our Chief Financial Officer; Terry Bayer, our Chief Operating Officer; Dr. James Howatt, our Chief Medical Officer; and Joseph White, our Chief Accounting Officer.

This call is being recorded and a thirty-day replay of the conference call will be available over the Internet through the Company website at www.molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina.
Mario Molina: Thank you, Juan Jose. Hello everyone and thank you for your interest in Molina Healthcare. 2008 was a very difficult year for companies across most industries. Despite a challenging economic environment, I’m pleased to report that Molina Healthcare achieved strong financial results for 2008. The Company’s earnings for the year were $2.25 per share. This is within our initial guidance range issued in January 2008. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for our accomplishments this year. Some of our operational achievements for 2008 include, the Florida NetPASS acquisition and Medicaid contract in the State of Florida, the re-branding of Mercy CarePlus as Molina Healthcare of Missouri, the groundbreaking on our IT facility in the State of New Mexico, the successful re-procurement of our New Mexico Medicaid contract. And for the fourth year in a row the ranking of several of our health plans among America’s best Medicaid health plans in U.S. News & World Report. As we look to 2009, it is clear that Medicaid managed care is a viable solution to covering the uninsured and alleviating states’ rising Medicaid budgets. Medicaid managed care can also provide a much-needed safety net for individuals affected by the current economic turmoil. Strengthening the safety net for families and children is a central component of health care reform proposals. And we are pleased to see that momentum continues to build. For example, last Wednesday President Barack Obama signed a bill reauthorizing the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP, for the next four and a half years. This bill preserves healthcare coverage for almost 7 million children, and provides new coverage for an additional 4.1 million children. It provides funding for outreach and enrollment efforts, bonus payments to states for enrolling the lowest income children in Medicaid, and the contingency fund to protect states from shortfalls due to unforeseen emergencies. The reauthorization of the SCHIP program will have an impact on our markets by expanding the pool of eligible children. California, Utah, Texas, Missouri and Michigan fund and contract for the SCHIP program separately, while Washington, New Mexico, Ohio and Florida include SCHIP populations in their Medicaid program. I’m pointing out this distinction because there has been confusion surrounding our participation in SCHIP in states that do not have a separate SCHIP contract. Yesterday the Senate approved its version of the Economic Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Senate appointed Senator Max Baucus and Charles Grassley, amongst others, to serve on their conference committee. The House appointed its own conferees, including Henry Waxman, Dave Camp and Jerry Lewis, among others. And it will take several days before a final agreement is reached. We are closely tracking the bill that includes a temporary increase in Medicaid spending of $87 billion over the next few years. This would be done in two ways. First, and across the board increase to the Federal Medical Assistance Percentages, or FMAP, for all states. Second, states experiencing higher unemployment rates would receive additional assistance. As outlined at our Investor Day, Molina currently operates in five states that have an unemployment rate higher than the national average that could benefit if this proposal is approved. We observed considerable organic growth in our health plans in 2008. And we project that nationwide; Medicaid enrollment will continue to grow in 2009, as evidenced by the approved SCHIP bill and the economic recovery proposal. The expansion of healthcare access under the Economic Stimulus Package and the SCHIP renewal will help many Americans through difficult times. We have the capacity to enroll additional members. We have five key priorities for managing our business, and they are leveraging administrative costs, capturing greater market share, prompt and accurate claims payment, financial strength, and continuing our commitment to providing quality healthcare. Let us review each of these priorities in more detail. First, we will leverage our administrative costs to protect our margin. We continue to be the industry leader in terms of controlling our administrative costs as a percentage of revenue and on a per member per month basis. This means that more of the funds that states entrust to us can be used for healthcare, and that we are better positioned to weather an economic downturn, given our low cost structure. We believe these two attributes give us a competitive advantage. For a more detailed review of our approach to administrative costs, I encourage those of you who did not attend our Investor Day in New York on January 22 to listen to Joseph White’s comments on administrative costs. Our second management priority is to position Molina Healthcare for the future by focusing on membership growth and capturing greater market share. Our key growth areas are organic growth, eligibility expansions, new populations, new market opportunities and managed care expansions. We will continue to pursue entry into new markets through both startups and acquisitions. Our third priority is to continue to work closely with our providers to ensure that claims get paid promptly and accurately. This is particularly important today, because assisting providers in managing their cash flow can positively influence their decision to continue to participate in Molina’s programs. We have made great progress in this area by focusing on reducing our claims inventories. We believe that reducing payment delays and administrative burdens are important steps to be taken to strengthen our provider networks. Our fourth management priority is to preserve our financial strengths by continuing to monitor our capital structure and investing in activities that yield a high return on investment. Our $200 million credit facility remains untapped. We have great confidence in the ability of our business to generate cash, and we maintain adequate financial reserves. Finally, we’re committed to providing quality healthcare. We are pleased that our health plan in Ohio earned a new health plan quality accreditation earlier this month. I want to congratulate our Ohio health plan on all of their hard work that led to this prestigious achievement. This accreditation makes Molina the industry leader, with six quality accredited health plans in California, Michigan, New Mexico, Utah, Washington and now Ohio. Next in the accreditation pipeline is Texas, which we expect to undergo the rigorous accreditation process some time this summer. We are very confident in the long-term fundamentals of our business, and we are well-positioned for 2009. I would now like to turn the call over to John, who will be discussing our quarterly and year-end results in detail.
John Molina: Thank you, Mario. As Mario said earlier, we overcame challenges and achieved solid financial results in 2008. EBITDA grew by 16% in 2008, despite a decrease in investment income of $9 million. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $62 million or $2.25 per diluted share, compared with net income of $58 million or $2.05 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2007. Net income for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2008 was approximately $16 million or $0.58 per diluted share, compared with net income of $18 million or $0.63 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2007. If we exclude investment income from both periods, net income would have been $1.1 million higher in Q4 2008 compared to Q4 2007. Our medical care ratio increased to 84.7% in the fourth quarter of 2008 from 83.6% in the fourth quarter of 2007. On a sequential quarterly basis, the medical care ratio for the fourth quarter of 2008 increased from 84.6% in the third quarter. This is consistent with historic seasonal variations. Our membership at year-end stood at almost 1.26 million members, up 9% from a year ago. We continue to see strong enrollment growth so far in 2009. As of February 2009, our 2009 enrollment has already grown by 2%. This figure does not include enrollment in our Florida health plan. Premium growth for the quarter and for the year was strong. For the fourth quarter of 2008, premium revenues were $809 million, an increase of $138 million or approximately 21%, over premium revenue in the fourth quarter of 2007. For all of 2008, premium revenues increased by $629 million or 26%, to $3 billion, compared to premiums in 2007 of $2.5 billion. Membership growth, mainly due to our acquisition in Missouri and higher enrollment in Ohio, New Mexico and California, contributed to the increase in premium revenues. Higher premium rates in the State of Washington also contributed to revenue growth. General and administrative expenses, including premium taxes were $92 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, representing 11.3% of total revenue, as compared with $81 million or 11.8% of total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2007. Our core SG&A or SG&A less premium taxes, decreased to 8.1% in the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared with 8.8% in the fourth quarter of 2007. The year-over-year decrease was mainly the result of increased enrollment and revenue in 2008. We have grown our revenue faster than our administrative costs and believe this trend will continue in 2009. Our per-member, per-month administrative cost for the fourth quarter of 2008 were below our PMPM costs in the fourth quarter of 2007. Days and claims payable decreased sequentially to 41 days at December 31, 2008 down from 44 days at September 30, 2008. The Company remains consistent in its reserving methodology. I would direct you to our claims statistics table in the earnings release. You can see that both bill charges and claims inventories per member are down by about 50% year-over-year. I would also like to point out that we received approximately 1.5 million more claims in 2008 than we did 2007. We ended the year with claims in inventory that were nearly half of the balance we had in 2007. This is another indication that we are paying our claims more rapidly. The speed at which we are paying our claims had the effect of lowering our operating cash flow in 2008. Cash flow from operating activities for all of 2008 was $40 million. Cash flow for the fourth quarter was strong at $61 million or almost four times net income. As we explained last quarter, the timing of the receipt of premiums recorded as deferred revenue in the Ohio and Utah health plans affected our operating cash flow in the third quarter. Those payments were received early in the fourth quarter. As the Company continues to grow, we expect cash flow to exceed net income. Excluding the impact of growth, we would expect cash flow to approximate net income plus depreciation and amortization. The Company finished the fourth quarter of 2008 with a strong cash position. Unrestricted cash and investments at the parent company were approximately $69 million. Statutory equity at our subsidiaries exceeded required equity by approximately $134 million. And as Mario said, there are no borrowings on our $200 million credit facility. Overall, this means that we have over $0.25 billion available for investing in growth opportunities. Now, moving on to our outlook for this year. As Juan Jose pointed out at the beginning of the call, we encourage investors to listen to our Investor Day webcast. During that presentation, we discussed in greater detail the risks and opportunities to our 2009 estimates. Today, we are reaffirming our guidance issued at our Investor Day on January 22nd. Please note that our guidance does not include any benefit from the reauthorization of the SCHIP program or from the Economic Stimulus Package. We expect EBITDA to be between $158 million and $167 million. We use EBITDA to manage our business and to measure our performance, as EBITDA better approximates our cash earnings. This measure is important given our conservative accounting practices for depreciation and amortization, as well as the new accounting for convertible debt. We expect earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.40. We expect net income to be in the range of $59 million to $65 million. We expect premium revenue of approximately $3.6 billion. This assumes a 3% per member, per month revenue increases primarily from the increases in our premium rates. We have only included in our guidance, premium increases that are already in place for the balance of 2009 and this is what constitutes our blended 3%. We’re not projecting rate increases in 2009 for any other states. Also, on the revenues side, investment income should be about $15 million for all of 2009. We expect medical care ratio to be approximately 85.5%. Items resulting in a higher medical care ratio for 2009, include the new membership in Florida, which has a higher percentage of aged, blind and disabled patients, as well as lower PMPM revenue in some states, as we discussed at Investor Day. I do want to remind everyone of our historic pattern of medical care ratios that suggest that our first quarter generally has the highest medical costs. This is especially true in 2009, as we will record Florida at a 90% medical care ratio until we get a good claims history. It is therefore likely that first quarter earnings will be lower than the other quarters of the year. We expect our core G&A, or G&A excluding premium taxes, to decline to approximately 7.5%, as we continue to leverage our administrative resources and grow our membership and revenue. We expect total G&A, including premium taxes, to be approximately 10.5%. Our guidance assumes 27 million shares outstanding and an effective tax rate of 41%. Depreciation and amortization will be approximately $43 million. This reflects an increase in capital expenditures that occurred in 2008, as well as the impact of the Florida transaction. It does not include any impact of share or convertible debt repurchases, although we have received Board authorization for such. Our guidance figures do not include future acquisitions or expansions or the potential dilution from our senior convertible notes. The new rules for convertible debt took effect in December, so we will experience a full year impact of this change in 2009. We expect that this accounting change will impact earnings by approximately $5.1 million or $0.12 per share. This amount is the incremental non-cash interest expense. Thus, we would like to remind everyone to please take the impact of new rules for convertible debt into consideration when constructing your estimates. Inclusion of the impact of the new rules will provide for an apples-to-apples comparison in estimates once they’re loaded on to First Call. We have included this charge in our current guidance. Finally, I want to take a minute to reemphasize something that we at Molina Healthcare have consistently talked about to the investor community. At Molina Healthcare, we have made significant investments of time and resources to ensure that our growth is sustainable over the long run. Our short-term view of the world is evaluated over three to five year time horizons as opposed to six months or a year. Over the last 30 years, we have built this business from one primary care clinic into a multi-state healthcare organization. Planning for the long run has been the key to this success. This long-term approach to planning defines our financial view regardless of what happens in the economy. Operator that concludes our prepared remarks, we are ready to take questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Josh Raskin - Barclays Capital.
Josh Raskin - Barclays Capital : First question just on the cash flow. I know it rebounded in the quarter. And John, you mentioned the Ohio and Utah reversals. I think you mentioned last quarter that was about $45 million. But you also mentioned last quarter that there was a deferred revenue timing issue with California that was, I think, $40.5 million that was received in October. So I think I was expecting actually even a little bit bigger of a reversal. So, was there any other one-timers or any other timing issues in the fourth quarter or was this just simply another acceleration of claims payment?
John Molina: I think Josh that although we got the catch up payment in California in October; we also got it delayed in December. So it’s sort of rolled over and didn’t have much of an impact. There has been some impact obviously from increased claims payment. But I think you might have been assuming that we were going to get both California payments, actually received four California payments in the quarter and we only received the three.
Josh Raskin - Barclays Capital : So theoretically they’re just a week behind or whatever it is.
John Molina: That’s right. Let me add on to that. We have not received IOUs from the State of California.
Josh Raskin - Barclays Capital : You only got three payments. That is what I was looking for. The second question just on the tax credits here. It looked like it added a couple of cents to the quarter. And I’m just curious, if you guys have an actual dollar amount for that? Is that is an issue that is completely behind you now at this point?
Joseph White: It is Joe. The issue you’re talking about is we had a California state audit where they reviewed certain economic development credits we take. As a result of that audit, we were able to let certain of those credits go into income. It is about $600,000 for credit value. It is an ongoing thing. Every time we have an audit we true up, and we are usually a little bit conservative, so there is usually a release when we have an audit.
Josh Raskin - Barclays Capital : Perfect. Then also let me sneak in a last question. Just California, was there anything that happened in the state? It is just the membership was very strong. Anything happened from a market perspective or was this just general growth in state Medicaid?
Terry Bayer: It is Terry. It was growth in Medicaid, and it was a result of our concerted efforts at outreach and local area marketing.
Josh Raskin - Barclays Capital: But, Terry, you think that is share gain as opposed to overall market growth?
Terry Bayer: I would say it is both, a little of both.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tom Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus.
Tom Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus : A question on the pending March provider cuts in California. Is there any update on that?
Mario Molina: This is Mario. No, we don’t have any real visibility into that yet. We have not received anything from the state, so we’re just going to have to wait and see.
Tom Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus: There is no opinion on timing as to when we might get some more clarity on that?
Mario Molina: We are still waiting for more information from the state.
Tom Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus: Have you guys seen anything unusual in flu trends this season yet?
James Howatt: This is Jim Howatt, actually we have. We’re starting to see the bump that we expected would happen at some point. But notable so far is the point by point, year-over-year compared to the last two years this flu season is less severe. And while we’re starting see the bump up that we usually see at this time of the year, it looks like it is going to be more moderate than even 2007, and certainly less severe than 2008. It’s all a bit of black box, but that is how it looks.
Tom Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus : Do you currently have any risk-based enrollment in Florida?
Mario Molina: Yes, we do.
Tom Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus : Can you give us a sense of what that is growing at?
Terry Bayer: We have currently 20,000 members.
Tom Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus : Then just lastly, how much did Molina spend in 2008 to get the accreditation on its various health plans? Then maybe how do you think about that in terms of budgeting what you want to spend on that process to gain accreditation?
Mario Molina: That is an interesting question. We don’t look at it that way, and we build it into our operations. We don’t segregate it. It is a part of the ongoing operations, a part of the ongoing business plans, so we don’t segregate out what we would have done if we had gotten the accreditation and what we would have done if we didn’t. It is rolled into our admin costs.
Tom Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus : It is just one of those things that differentiates you guys against some of your peers and obviously there is a cost to gain that. Just a thought.
Mario Molina: Whatever it is, we think it is worth it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank.
Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank : Could you give us an update on your current views on the rate environment in Florida, just in the context of WellCare just announcing their exit from two markets there? And then just relative to enrollment, are you still comfortable with your target to add 60,000 lives this year in Florida?
John Molina: We’re still comfortable with our enrollment targets. As far as the rates decline we’re not in the two areas that WellCare is in, so it is hard for us to comment on specifically what happened with WellCare. I will say that we are experiencing rate challenges in all of our markets, which is why we have not put anything in our guidance that would suggest we’re going to get rate increases in 2009 beyond those that we’ve already received.
Mario Molina: Scott, this is Mario. I also want to emphasize the point that I made in my remarks that in a time when we are facing rate challenges and pressure from the states, I think being the low-cost provider does give us a competitive advantage. We have worked very hard to hold the line on our administrative costs, and we expect to see the cost as a percentage go down in 2009.
Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank: Then if you can talk about your expected accretion performance of Mercy relative to your initial expectations. I think you had initially guided for that to add around $0.13 to EPS in 2008. Actually it looks like the MLR in Missouri improved quite significantly in the fourth quarter to around 75%. I guess just as you sum up that year how the performance ended up coming in relative to your plan?
John Molina: Generally, when we get an acquisition, we anticipate that the first year the performance will decline from the previous year, and then it will as we are able to integrate, improve. I think that it is a credit to the teams that we have both at the corporate office and at the Missouri health plan that we are able to move that integration faster and further along than we would generally anticipated. But I would say, although it is ahead of schedule, it is nothing that is unexpected.
Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank : Then just relative to Nevada, I clearly know this is a very small book, I think only around 700 lives. It looks like the MLR was up to around 149% in the fourth quarter. And just wondering about expectations for growth in that market, and whether you’re comfortable that you can build up enough of a sizable block there maybe to reduce some of the volatility in the MLR that you saw there this year?
Terry Bayer: This is Terry. We’re working on our relationships with those providers and our ability to control medical costs, before we aggressively grow that market. So that is the answer.
Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank : One last question, just on fiscal stimulus have you had a chance to determine yet whether you think all of the money is coming in will actually lead to states actually expanding the programs and expanding their eligibility levels relative to what they have currently? Or do you think that most states will really just use this to try to plug in the projected gaps that they have in their budgets right now?
Mario Molina: This is Mario. We had quite a discussion about that earlier. There are a couple of things about this. First, since Medicaid is an entitlement program, as people lose their healthcare coverage and their incomes dwindle more people will become eligible for the Medicaid and SCHIP programs. We expect to see growth in the number of eligible beneficiaries in 2009. The other thing that is important to note is that the language in the bills require states to keep the eligibility requirements, I believe, at the levels they were at on July 1, 2008. So they can’t be more restrictive going forward. And in fact some of the states may actually relax the eligibility requirements a little bit. Our hope is that this money will be used to cover more beneficiaries.
Operator: Your next question comes from Daryn Miller - Goldman Sachs.
Shelley Gnall - Goldman Sachs: This is Shelley Gnall on for Daryn Miller today. Following up on your prepared remarks about SCHIP mix and I apologize if I missed this, but also following up on the Investor Day, I think John made an effort to spike out your mix of business, but I don’t think truly reflected the SCHIP mix. I’m just wondering can you break that down for us? What does your mix look like after adjusting for that SCHIP that is embedded in the Medicaid contracts relative to the 5% we saw at the Investor Day?
John Molina: Unfortunately, we can’t do that. And the reason is in some of the states they come in under the same contract as the Medicaid members and you can’t differentiate them. What we do think is that the number of eligibles in both the SCHIP program and the Medicaid program in our states will increase.
Mario Molina: Again, let me just add, there is no benefit from the SCHIP legislation in our current guidance.
Shelley Gnall - Goldman Sachs: Understood, okay and then just maybe a quick follow-up on the FMAP issue. It doesn’t look like the FMAP will be sufficient to fill the gap in California. Any thoughts there?
John Molina: Which gap are you referring to in California?
Shelley Gnall - Goldman Sachs: The state budgetary gap in California.
John Molina: I don’t think that the federal government was intending to make California whole through the Medicaid program. The purpose of that is to provide more funding for the state to cover their Medicaid liabilities. I think it will definitely help. We’re looking at perhaps another $11 billion for California to fund the Medicaid program.
Shelley Gnall - Goldman Sachs: I know it is hard to figure out how much of the state budgetary shortfall is attributed to their Medicaid program. I am just doing a quick sort of 20% assumption that the budgetary shortfall is comparable to their spending on Medicaid. I think that is way we think about it. I am just wondering if you had any comments on whether that, that is an appropriate way to think about it, and whether you think that is going to still fall short.
John Molina: I’m sorry. I don’t understand your question.
Shelley Gnall - Goldman Sachs: Okay no worries, we can follow-up offline.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Rex - J.P. Morgan.
John Rex - J.P. Morgan: I was just wondering if you could give a little more color on Washington, you noted the higher specials and hospital costs there, and how that trended in the quarter, if that is not something you saw continuing through December and into January?
John Molina: I think one of the things that we’re going to see in Washington, because they did decrease the provider rates a bit effective January 1 or February 1, we’re going to see a little bit of a squeeze in Washington. That is already embedded in our guidance. Washington has been a great performer for us. We expect it to have another good year. And I think it is more seasonal than anything else.
John Rex - J.P. Morgan: I guess so though, so you would expect that thing to continue. I guess you are saying you expect that to continue. And the rate schedule will doesn’t go into effect until January, right? So it looked like there was some increase in costs going on in the 4Q also in your commentary on the press release.
Joseph White: John, this is Joe speaking. I think if you look back Washington all the way back to August 1 of 2007, where they had some adjustment of their DRGs through a fairly small rate increase in January this year, we have just seen a gradual compression of margins in Washington. It is happening in rate that we can compensate for. It is not unexpected by us. It is really what we have been looking out over the last year and a half. So I think it is just a lot of things over time have been compressing those margins a little bit. I can’t point to any one thing. Utilization remains good.
John Molina: This also underscores why we have made a concerted effort to diversify the revenue stream. As you may recall, one of our strategic goals is diversify our revenue stream so that no state makes up more than 15% of the revenue. We are going to continue to do that. And frankly, New Mexico, Michigan, Missouri are all performing at a level where they can take some of the pressure off the Washington plant. And we see that as a very good thing.
John Rex - J.P. Morgan: Just the way it was, you were talking the sequential increase was due to higher fee-for-service specials and hospital costs. So, I was thinking you were saying there is something going on in the quarter in terms of higher utilization. Is that not correct? Or is that, we’re supposed to think about it as more gradual. I know that 3Q was abnormally low, but it sounded like you were indicating there was a spike in the 4Q, and that is what I’m trying to understand?
John Molina: It is difficult to tease out a single quarter John. I would just view it as a more cumulative process.
John Rex - J.P. Morgan: Okay, but as you’re looking into ‘09 and so then first quarter you get roughly 4% or 5% rate decrease. Is that all then, is that right in Washington?
John Molina: In Washington it was less than that. I think the rate decrease was about 3%. And part of that will pass through to the providers.
Mario Molina : The cut in February is also tied to a cut in fee schedule, so it won’t be as dramatic as the actual cut on the top line.
John Rex - J.P. Morgan: Okay, should we be expecting maybe versus let’s just look at full year Washington then. So you were running like an 81% loss ratio. Should we expect a couple of hundred basis points of deterioration in that though, as we’re looking out for ‘09 business based on the rate action and then maybe this gradual rise in provider costs?
John Molina: I hate to tease out these things on a guidance basis on a state-by-state basis. I don’t think it is going to go up as high as a couple hundred basis points.
John Rex - J.P. Morgan: Okay and just a quick one. I just wanted to clarify something on the cash-flow statement. Can you remind the OTTI and the unrealized loss, and it looks like an offset here, just remind me what that is?
Joseph White: We could spend a lot of time on that.
John Rex - J.P. Morgan: It suddenly popped up.
Joseph White: I will be as brief as I can. Basically, you’ll recall we have some auction rate securities. We entered into an agreement with a brokerage to repurchase those auction rate securities in about two years. Essentially, where that left us due to the way the accounting gods looked at things, once we entered into that two-year horizon that is far shorter than the actual maturity of the actual auction rate notes. Therefore, we ceased to have the intent, so we’re told by our auditors to hold to maturity. That triggered a reclassification of the securities from available for sale into marketing securities, which means we had to mark the securities down to market. At the same time, we now have the benefit of this put with the brokerage house in two years, which to put the securities back to them at par value in two years. So that has a value. The combination of those two events, marking the option rate securities to market, which is a hit, and then booking the asset of this put to the brokerage firm, cost us about $600,000 on investment loss. So, while we have strengthened our position, and are going to be out of those securities in two years minimum, we have had to take a little haircut in the process, which will be recouped when we put the securities back. I would love to talk to you about that.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse.
Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse : My first question was just on the inventory claims data that you provide. My first question was just in terms of the percentage of the billed charges that you actually estimate that you have to pay out, could you give us a sense of what that number is, and if or how that has changed over the last year?
John Molina: Greg, we don’t really look at that, in part because the populations have been changing so much. We’re going to add on Florida, which is going to have an impact. We added more ABD members in Ohio. It is just all over the place. A lot of it is, unlike Medicare or commercial business where the prices may be closer; we’ve got ten different states with ten different fee schedules that vary quite a bit.
Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse : Okay I guess where I’m trying to go with that is just obviously that number has fallen off a lot. Even if you go back before 12/31 ‘07 was even higher. I’m trying to figure out, that is a number that is greater than what you actually expect to pay out. So I’m trying to figure out how much further down that 115 can go? Do you expect that to stabilize as a percentage of the total payables or to continue to go down or can you give us a sense for what direction that is going? In other words, have you worked off most of the inventory that you were trying to pay off?
John Molina: We are down to I think --
Joseph White: $115 million.
John Molina: $115 million, no charges. And then inventory is like six days receipts on hand. I’m not sure we’re going to get it down much further, but having said that, we thought at the end of our third quarter we couldn’t get the inventory down any further. It is possible that we can continue to bring it down. As Terry emphasized, as Mario emphasized [Audio Break] providing cash flow to the providers is important to us. Now, we are adding Florida, and until the providers really understand how to bill us, where to bill us that kind of stuff, there may be some change this quarter. I don’t know how material it will be.
Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse : Okay, but all things else equal, you would expect that to stabilize, would be your best bet I guess?
Mario Molina: Let’s put it this way, it is hard for us to imagine it going much lower.
Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse : Okay. That’s what I thought. My second question was just on the, I guess a quick one. What is your RBC, you gave us the absolute dollar number, what is the percentage of company action level?
John Molina: We’re pulling that as we speak.
Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse : Maybe in the meantime, Mario, just to clarify again, how does that mechanics of the SCHIP match work between, how does it differ between a state that has rolled it into their Medicaid program and then one that is separate?
Mario Molina: My understanding is that there is a higher match from the federal government on the SCHIP, but in some of the states, the patients come to us through the same contract as our Medicaid contract. So we get a member and it is a member. We can’t look at that person and say, “oh, you are an SCHIP member, or you are a Medicaid member”. It is just a member in those states where we have a single contract, and they are coming to us through that contract. We don’t get involved in the federal match, the states bill the federal government, I believe, monthly for the matching funds. So they report how many patients they have, or how many members or enrollees that they have, and then the federal government has to match the funding, but in those states where we do not have a separate contract, they look the same to us and to the providers.
Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse : Okay, so from a state that has it rolled into my Medicaid program, and I’m looking to increase by SCHIP eligibility, I can just raise the income threshold and be paid at the higher SCHIP matching rate on that population without changing my Medicaid eligibility rules or anything like that? In other words, keep the Medicaid eligibility untouched and just raise that piece of the Medicaid program that relates to the higher income kids. Is that right?
Mario Molina: Between the state and the federal government, the states have to demonstrate that the patients that they are billing for that match on are in the right category, because the state does not want them shifting kids who should be in Medicaid into the SCHIP program and then there is a matching payment that is made from the federal government to the state. So, you can’t simply just shift a kid, for example, and say “well if we put them in the SCHIP contract, we will get higher reimbursement”. And there is even language saying that, we talked about this, encouraging the states to make sure that the kids are in the proper program, whether it is Medicaid or SCHIP.
Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse: How quickly do you think the states are going to respond to the SCHIP reauthorization, the additional funding there? Do you think it will be in this legislative session or do you think they will wait until next year?
Mario Molina: I think they will do it this year. They are under pressure because they’ve got more kids to cover. So, the faster they can get these things geared up, the better off they will be.
Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse : That could potentially lead to SCHIP growth that you see by the end of this year you think potentially?
Mario Molina: Yes.
John Molina: And possibly Medicaid growth because, as Mario said, within the SCHIP reauthorization, there are funds that will reward states for signing up kids under the Medicaid program, but again, none of that is included in our guidance.
Joseph White: It is Joe. You had asked about RBC levels. In total across the company, we are at 156% of the required amount. Just remember, some of our states are at 200% RBC, some are at 300%, but we are 156% of the required amount.
Operator: Your final question comes from Carl McDonald - Oppenheimer & Co.
Carl McDonald - Oppenheimer & Co : I just had another follow-up on the mechanics of SCHIP, which is for the 4 million children that are being added to the program, do the states have to opt into that, or does that just happen automatically? So said a little differently, to cover all of these additional children it is going to cost the states more money, which a lot of states don’t have at this point. Is it something where the states literally have to say, we are going to participate in this program, or is it mandated as part of the legislation that they offer it?
Mario Molina: I think it is optional Carl, but I’m not positive. The states I don’t think have to participate in the SCHIP program. In fact, when you come right down to it, Medicaid is also optional, but I don’t think there’s any state that would seriously opt out of the Medicaid program.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I now turn the call back to you, Dr. Molina. Please continue with your presentation or your closing remarks.
Mario Molina: All I would like to say is thank you for participating in our call. And we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect the line.

Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Molina Healthcare third quarter conference call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Juan Jose Orellana, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan José Orellana:  Thank you, Kim. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare's financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2008. The company's earnings release reporting its results was issued today after the market closed and is now posted for viewing on our company website. On the call with me today are several members of our executive team; Dr. Mario Molina, our CEO; John Molina, our CFO; Terry Bayer, our COO; Dr. James Howatt, our Chief Medical Officer; and Joseph White, our Chief Accounting Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call and take your questions. I also would like to remind you that our comments today contain numerous forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. All of our forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations and assumptions that are subject to numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release, our 10-K annual report and our 10-Q quarterly reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab of our company website or on the SEC's website. All forward-looking statements made during today's call represent our judgment as of October 22, 2008, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements. This call is being recorded and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available over the Internet through the company's website at www.molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina.
Mario Molina:  Thank you, Juan Jose, and hello, everyone. Like all of you, we have been closely monitoring the capital markets and the extraordinary pace of change during the past few weeks. Despite these headwinds, we are pleased to report solid financial results for the quarter as well as continued opportunities in both our business and our industry. Earnings for the third quarter were $0.62 per diluted share. And as John will cover in greater detail, these results continue to reflect strong revenue growth, continued enrollment gains, and a constant focus on administrative efficiency. I want to point out to everyone that today we are confirming 2008 guidance with a midpoint of $2.30 per share. That means that after a year dominated by bad news in our industry that included declining investment income, state budget shortfalls, a bad flu season, a crisis in the credit markets, and the impairment of investment securities previously thought to be safe, we expect the year to end for our company much as we thought it would before most of these events occurred. Our success speaks both to the resiliency of our Medicaid managed care business model and to the unique strengths of our company. We have 28 years of experience in this business. And we know that a weakening economy brings opportunities as well as challenges. So long as we stay focused on operations, administrative cost control, and conservative cash management, we will continue to serve the increasing Medicaid population that generally accompanies a weakening economy. We stand ready to assist our state and federal partners in providing high quality, accessible healthcare services to those most deeply affected by the current economic downturn. Once again, John and I will use the framework of our strategic plan to discuss our financial and operating results. The five years of focus under our strategy plan are growth, financial strength, customer service, compliance, and quality. Our revenues continue to grow with premium revenue up 26% compared to the same quarter last year. Our growth is a combination of the addition of the Missouri health plan, strong growth in the newer markets like Ohio and Medicare, and continued organic growth in our more established markets. We continue to make progress on our diversification strategy. Revenues from California, Michigan, and Washington make up a smaller percentage of our overall revenue today than they did in the third quarter of 2007. This metric is noteworthy because we still achieve organic membership growth in California and Washington. At the same time, our co-administrative cost as a percentage of revenue have decreased sequentially from the second quarter of 2008 and year-over-year comparing to the third quarter of 2007 to 2008, indicating that we are becoming more efficient in the administration of our health plans. In the area of customer service, we continue to make gains. For example, we endeavor to pay our providers quickly. Evidence of our success can be found in the medical claims and benefits payable section of our earnings release. Claims in inventory per member fell by 35% from 0.17 for the first nine months of 2007 to 0.11 for the first nine months of 2008. Fewer unpaid claims and inventory gives us a better handle on our true medical costs, decreases our IBNR, and means that we are less reliant on estimate to determine our medical costs. Compliance and quality often go hand-in-hand. Faster payment of claims reduces the risk of paying fines or interest payments on unpaid claims. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, contracted with NCQA to evaluate Medicare Advantage Special Needs Plans. As a reminder, Molina Healthcare operates Special Needs Plans for patients simultaneously eligible for Medicare and Medicaid in California, Washington, Nevada, Utah, Michigan, and Texas. Survey standards include complex cure management, improving member satisfaction, and clinical quality improvements. All eligible Molina Medicare plans scored 100% for all standards in the survey. Congratulations to our Medicare team, our state health plans, and the Corporate Quality Improvement team on this accomplishment. Next, I would like to cover a couple of issues from previous quarters that remain topical today. The medical costs in the Ohio market have been a focus for sometime. We initially projected that certain initiatives would bring down the medical care ratio in Ohio to about 88% in 2008. Those initiatives have taken longer to develop than anticipated. However, new provider contracts implemented in September should help bring down new costs. Also we now have better control over behavioral health after transitioning responsibility from an outside vendor to our Ohio health plan staff on September 1. Finally, a revision in risk adjustment factors for elderly and disabled patients in Ohio went into effect on September 1 and will affect revenue by providing an additional $500,000 per month. These three items should mitigate medical costs in the fourth quarter for our Ohio health plan. Finally, political and economic events relating to the California budget continue to evolve. Governor Schwarzenegger signed the California state budget on September 24. However, the state fiscal situation remains uncertain. The governor and legislative leaders are monitoring the state’s fiscal situation and may be revisiting this issue in the coming weeks. A special legislative session may be necessary. With the passage of the budget, the state has resumed payments to government contractors. Our California subsidiary has now received its premium payments. These payments, however, were not received until October and therefore negatively affected our cash flow figures for the third quarter. I would now like to turn the call over to John so that he can discuss with you our financial performance in the third quarter as well as other elements of our strategic plan.
John Molina:  Thank you, Mario. And hello, everyone. Results for the third quarter of 2008 were $0.62 per diluted share, which matched our third quarter 2007 performance despite a $3 million year-over-year decrease in investment income. Year-to-date earnings per share are $1.67, a 17% improvement over 2007 results. With all the concerns in our industry about investment income, state budget shortfalls, last spring’s flu season, credit market issues, and the impairment of investment securities, today’s results demonstrate they are strength and resilience of our company. I think it’s worth emphasizing what Mario just said. Not only have we achieved solid financial performance, but we’ve also capitalized on some challenges just mentioned. We’ve grown enrollment, renegotiated key provider contracts, controlled our administrative expenses, and prudently managed our cash to achieve positive results in an uncertain environment. In the past, we have discussed non-GAAP measures that are also very helpful in evaluating our financial performance. For example, while net income grew by 17% year-over-year, EBITDA grew by 25% during the same period. You will find an expanded discussion on EBITDA in today’s earnings release. We believe that EBITDA is a useful supplemental measure to investors because it is consistent with how we evaluate our financial performance as it provides greater clarity on the basic operations of our business. EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts and others to evaluate companies in our industry. One of the key areas of focus in our strategic plan is growth, which also leads to diversification in revenue and enrollment. The 26% growth in our premium revenues over third quarter of 2007 is primarily the result of our diversification efforts. Our Michigan acquisition contributed about one-third of our growth in revenue, while Ohio and Medicare health plans contributed another third. The remaining third of our revenue growth came from our more established health plans where enrollment grew 5% from the third quarter of 2007. This balanced growth from acquisitions, from new markets and populations, and from core operations is exactly what we mean by diversification. Our improved diversification is also helping to steady our premium rates. We’ve talked a lot about rate challenges in Ohio and California this year. This quarter we can talk about the rate relief we received in Missouri and Michigan. Effective July 1, 2008, our Missouri health plan received a premium increase of approximately 8.5%. Effective October 1, 2008, our Michigan health plan received a rate increase of approximately 5.5%. Some of these increases are tied to benefit and program changes, and some we passed on to our providers. In addition, there is another increase of slightly less than 1% to remedy the double taxation we have experienced under the Michigan Business Tax. While we have received draft rates for Ohio effective January 1, 2009, we have not received official notification of any rate changes. The same applies for California. We also recorded $3.7 million in supplemental revenue at our Michigan health plan during the third quarter. The supplemental revenue is intended to offset the unintended effects of the Michigan Business Tax that replace Michigan’s Single Business Tax effective January 1, 2008. The unintended effect of the Michigan Business Tax is the taxation of both premiums and net income of health plans, driving the effective federal and state combined tax rate on the company’s Michigan health plan to nearly 49%. The supplemental revenue is intended to offset Michigan business taxation of gross receipts for the nine months ended September 30, 2008. After allowing for the supplemental revenue and the aforementioned ongoing Michigan Business Tax relief, we anticipate that our 2008 Michigan tax expense will be approximately $500,000 higher before federal tax benefit than the amount computed using the Single Business Tax methodology. I say all of this to emphasize that we have not sought special treatment under the Michigan tax code. We have only asked to have the double taxation of both revenue and net income mitigated. As I mentioned a minute ago, effective October 1, 2008, the Michigan health plan received an estimated blended rate increase of approximately 1% for ongoing Michigan business tax relief. Medicare revenues continue to grow. Sequentially revenue grew by over 20% or $5 million from the second quarter of 2008. Due to higher enrollment, higher premium rates, and the recognition of approximately $2.6 million in risk adjustment revenue. Consistent with our strategic plan, we continue to enhance our revenue diversification efforts. Earlier this month, Molina Healthcare of Florida was awarded a Medicaid contract by the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration. This was a key accomplishment for our organization and it marks a point where our health plan startup efforts and our acquisition strategy intersect. Our new Medicaid contract combined with our acquisition of Florida NetPASS will provide us with a necessary platform for transitioning the membership to a full risk contract. We anticipate that our Florida health plans enrollment of the NetPASS membership will begin in December 2008 with a full transition to be completed in the first quarter of 2009. Florida NetPASS currently provides services to approximately 55,000 Florida MediPass members in South and Central Florida. It’s also important to note that in the third quarter of 2008 we incurred approximately $800,000 in startup costs related to Florida without any associated revenues in that state. Our consolidated membership grew by nearly 16% year-over-year including the Missouri health plan. Sequentially our membership grew by approximately 5,000 members. Organic enrollment growth during 2008 is running at approximately 8%, nearly double the historic figure of 3% to 4%. It is important to remember that the current economic environment offers us opportunities as well as challenges. State budget pressures make cost-effective solutions like Medicaid managed care more attractive, while increasing unemployment will result in increased eligibility for Medicaid. This transition, however, is not automatic, as assets must be depleted before families become eligible for means- tested benefits. Our medical care ratio increased to 84.6% in the third quarter of 2008 from 83.7% in the third quarter of 2007. Sequentially the medical care ratio increased by 40 basis points from 84.2% for the quarter ended June 30, 2008. High medical care ratio in California, New Mexico, and Ohio outweighed the improvement in medical care ratios in Michigan, Missouri, and Washington. California’s medical care ratio increase is partially due to premium rate decreases in the first half of the quarter, which were stated by a court injunction on August 18, as well as higher medical costs. The main causes of New Mexico’s higher medical care ratio are a decline in premium rates and accruals for some significant provider settlements. We continue to work through the obstacles in Ohio, where the overall medical care ratio has yet to come down. But recent operational improvements give us reason to remain optimistic. For example, we in-sourced our behavioral health services and we also renegotiated key provider contracts. We expect both of these efforts to begin bear fruit in the fourth quarter of this year. Additionally, we received new risk-adjusted ABD rates effective September 1, 2008 that we estimate will increase annual revenue in Ohio by approximately $6 million. Control over our G&A expense is another reason why we have weathered the challenge in the past year so well. G&A expenses in the third quarter were 11.1% of total revenue or $88 million as compared to 11.7% of total revenue for the third quarter of 2007 or $74 million. Core G&A expenses, defined as G&A expenses less premium taxes, were 8% of total revenue for the third quarter of 2008 as compared to 8.4% for the third quarter of 2007. We’ve recorded an effective tax rate of 39.6% for the third quarter of 2008, bringing our year-to-date effective tax rate to 40.4%. Again, the effective tax rate is higher than our historical rate due to the change in the Michigan state tax calculation that went into effect back in January of this year. Cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 was $20 million compared with cash provided by operating activities of $113 million for the same period in 2007, a decrease of $133 million. Significant contributors to this decrease included the following. First was a $41 million increase in our California health plan receivable as of September 30, 2008 related to our July and August payments. Prior to the signing of the budget on September 24, 2008, the State of California had ceased paying its vendors for the previous two months. Subsequently, all receivables due to our California health plan at September 30, 2008 were collected in October 2008. Second, the timing of the receipt of premiums recorded as deferred revenue in the Ohio and Utah health plans netted to a total decline of $45 million year-over-year. Assuming that the timing of these payments next year is consistent with this year, we do not expect deferred revenues to have an adverse impact on cash flow in 2009. And third, the acceleration of claims payments across all of our subsidiaries, combined with the maturation of claims payment practices in Texas and Ohio, reduced medical claims and benefits payable, thereby lowering cash flow by $32 million when compared to the first nine months of 2007. As we discussed in the past, Molina is striving for operational excellence in the provider payment process. Our primary objective is to pay our providers promptly. And our claim statistics continue to demonstrate that we're doing so as claims inventories continue to decline. Specifically, the number of claims in inventory has declined by 27% year-over-year, while bill charges in inventory have decreased 37% year-over-year. This improvement in our claims processing is even more impressive when we consider that claims receipts have increased 18% year-over-year and bill charges in claims received have increased 29% year-over-year. I want to reiterate what Mario said. Fewer unpaid claims in inventory gives us a better handle on our true medical costs, decreases our IBNR. That means that we are less reliant on estimates to determine our medical costs. Share used for computing diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2008 were 27.6 million versus 28.4 million in the third quarter of 2007. The company had cash and investments at the parent level of approximately $83 million at September 30, 2008, including the auction rate securities with a fair value of $19 million. We do not have equity exposure in Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, or AIG. While we do own Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt, those instruments are now backed by the US treasury. We therefore do not anticipate any write-downs related to these investments. Although we remain focused on operating results, we continue to explore ways to protect and maximize our investments. We have pursued safer investments, which have limited our short-term exposure, but are more sensitive to interest rate changes. We have managed our cash position to buy back shares, which we believe is an excellent use of cash in this environment, as we believe our shares are good long-term investment. During the third quarter of 2008, we repurchased about 91,000 shares of our common stock for approximately $2.7 million at an average cost of $29.97 per share. Through October 22, 2008, we have repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares at an aggregate purchase price of $45 million. We are confirming our guidance previously issued on July 23, 2008. For the purpose of EPS calculation, we would expect diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 27.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 and 27.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. We expect our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and year ended 2008 to be approximately 41%. Finally, as Mario mentioned, difficult times lead to state cost pressure and a greater number of families accessing government programs such as Medicaid and SCHIP. Over our 28-year history, we have developed, refined and established a business model for serving those who are most in need and the agencies we contract with regardless of the economic environment. We offer access and a documented quality product and a lower administrative cost, positioning our company as a logical partner for states looking for cost-effective solutions. We are the right solution at the right time. Thus we entered the fourth quarter with a renewed sense of optimism, as our business and our operations remain strong, our enrollment continues to grow, and our state partners are providing rate relief. All of this, despite the backdrop of a very difficult economic environment. Operator, this concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions. Operator, are there questions?
Operator:  (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Joshua Raskin of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays Capital:  Hi, thanks. Good evening. First question, just on the membership growth in the economy, it sounded like you guys alluding to the 28 years of history in the business. I’m curious if you look back, maybe the most recent, the early 2000 period, or even early ‘90s, and I guess you could look back to the ‘80s as well, what are your certain expectations for membership growth? What would you think sort of in an ’09 period in terms of organic membership?
Mario Molina:  Well, we’re not making projections today about 2009, but we do know that there are some metrics you can apply to correlate between unemployment and growth in the Medicaid population. We do anticipate it to grow. And as John mentioned, there is going to be a delay because people have to spend down their assets before they qualify for Medicaid. But I think we can confidently say that the pool of Medicaid beneficiaries should grow in 2009.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays Capital:  Okay. But I guess not necessary for ’09 guidance, Mario, but maybe even looking back historically, maybe what are some of the data points that you saw? What was sort of growth rates you would expect, or at least –?
John Molina:  Yes. Josh, I think Kaiser Family Foundation put out some numbers recently, and they suggest that for every 1% increase in unemployment, you get about another 1 million people eligible for Medicaid and SCHIP.
Mario Molina:  And just to be clear, at the end of John’s comments, when he used the word thus, I want everyone to know that John regularly uses the word thus in conversation.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays Capital:  Yes, I’ve got it in my notes several times. Second question, just around the risk-adjusted revenues in Medicare, I know it’s still a very small part of the book. It was about $2.6 million. Were those final settlements related to ’07, or what would be – I don’t know if Joe is around, but what exactly was the accounting for that one?
Joseph White:  Hi, Josh. Yes, it’s Joe. Those are related to 2007 and 2008, risk-adjusters and a part fee settlement.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays Capital:  Okay. So that’s just you are catching up – so some of that I guess would theoretically be related to (inaudible) as well.
Joseph White:  That’s correct. And going forward, as we grow, it’s going to be a bigger part of our business. We see that every year.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays Capital:  Okay. And then I guess the confirmation of earnings, we can sort of take that for face value, but it sort of implies a very wide range for the fourth quarter. And I was wondering is that just sort of really just a factor of we are confirming guidance for the full year or is there really a lot of uncertainty that could create – how would you get from the high end to the low end for the fourth quarter guidance?
Mario Molina:  Josh, there’s really two components. Number one, we don’t give quarterly guidance. And number two, we are confirming the annual guidance that we gave in July.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays Capital:  Well, I guess you could have narrowed your annual guidance in an effort?
Mario Molina:  Yes, we could have, but that would in effect when giving quarterly guidance since there is only one quarter left, Josh. So, in keeping with our policy to only issue annual guidance, we’re simply going to confirm our annual guidance. We think we are on track to hit those numbers.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays Capital:  Okay, understood.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Nersessian of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Greg Nersessian – Credit Suisse:  Hey, thanks. And I’ll be the first one to wish John a happy birthday. Appreciate your spending it with us this evening. First question, could you just clarify the California rate? I guess you said you got the 3% cut through that injunction date and then you went back to the historical rate. So if the cut goes into effect, then can we assume you’d back to a 3% cut and that would apply retroactively? I wasn't sure exactly about the moving pieces there.
Mario Molina:  Well, what we have done is taken a decrease in revenue for that period, I believe it was July 1 to August 18, and then gone back to the pre-injunction rates for the revenue. We were all back to provider decreases. And in fact, some of the provider decreases like the capitation, I don't think ever occurred. The injunction is still in effect. And the state is appealing it. So we’ll just have to wait and see what the outcome is. But for right now, we are operating with the pre-injunction revenue and pre-injunction provider contracts.
Joseph White:  Yes. Greg, it’s Joe. If I could just add to that, if you want to look at it in shortcut, remember we talked about roughly a 6% decrease. For this quarter, we implemented that for half the quarter and worked out about a 3% decrease. So that is taking a lot shortcuts, but I think you can see how it works out.
Greg Nersessian – Credit Suisse:  Okay. So, that 3% that you are alluding to, that’s sort of the net effect of the revenue and the offsetting change in the provider fee schedule?
Joseph White:  No, that’s purely revenue impact to us.
Greg Nersessian – Credit Suisse:  Okay. And then on the decline in the DCP in the quarter, I think you alluded to both the – obviously the inventory being down significantly, but also you mentioned the IBNR also down. Could you sort of break out that drop in DCP between the IBNR and the inventory?
Joseph White:  I think they are interrelated. So it’s not really – we’re not really able to separate the two into two distinct things, Greg. They sort of – the decrease in claims does feed into the decrease in the IBNR because we are getting claims faster than getting them paid faster. So the component of IBNR, which is really incurred by not paid in-house, received but not paid goes down.
Greg Nersessian – Credit Suisse:  Okay. And then – okay. And then just on that Michigan tax payment, is it fair to say that $3.7 million, that applied to the nine-month period, so just break that out evenly if you were to sort of recap each of the quarters to appropriately reflect that change?
Joseph White:  That would work.
Greg Nersessian – Credit Suisse:  Okay. Okay, thank you.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Daryn Miller of Goldman Sachs.
Shelley Gnall – Goldman Sachs:  Hi, thanks. This is Shelley Gnall in for Daryn Miller. My first question, in California, can you provide us some details on the progress of your recontracting, and also comment on what would happen if the 10% provider cut is permanently blocked? What would happen to those recontracted rate?
Mario Molina:  Well, as – go ahead, Terry?
Terry Bayer:  Yes. This is Terry Bayer. Based on the injunction, we are not taking a fee-for-service reduction of 10%, and we have rolled back the contracts we negotiated and we stored those to pre-cut rate. So those are off the table at this time.
Shelley Gnall – Goldman Sachs:  Okay, great. And then moving on to Ohio, do you have a sense of how the Ohio MCR would have looked if your central region recontracting was affected for this quarter?
Mario Molina:  I’m sorry, could you ask the question again? I didn’t quite understand.
Shelley Gnall – Goldman Sachs:  Sorry, this is a question that is coming from Daryn. Hopefully I'm asking it correctly. He is wondering, do you have a sense of how the Ohio MCR would have looked if your central region recontracting was affected for this quarter?
Joseph White:  I think it’s – this is Joe speaking. I think it’s fair to say it would have looked better, but we don’t have that calculation at hand, no.
Shelley Gnall – Goldman Sachs:  Okay. And then maybe moving on to the medical cost side, are there interesting trends emerging on the hospital inpatient or outpatient utilization side?
Joseph White:  That’s such a broad question.
Mario Molina:  Do you mean in Ohio? Do you mean across the country?
Shelley Gnall – Goldman Sachs:  I mean, I guess if there is regional variances, I mean I think what we’ve heard from some of the commercial managed care providers is that there has been sort of weak inpatient utilization whereas outpatient I think has been a little bit higher. I’m just wondering if you are seeing any trends emerging.
James Howatt:  This is Dr. Howatt. We’ve not seen any unique identifying trends.
Shelley Gnall – Goldman Sachs:  Okay, I appreciate it. That’s it for our questions.
Mario Molina:  Thank you.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Carroll of Stifel Nicolaus.
Tom Carroll – Stifel Nicolaus:  Hi, good evening. Just couple of clarifications, Ohio and Michigan. Is there any reason to assume that the draft Ohio rates will differ materially from actual? And then secondly, on Michigan, is the rate increase there that you talked about and alluded to in the press release, is that basically all going to be passed through to providers? And I’ll stop there.
John Molina:  Okay. Let me talk about Ohio. We don’t want to make assumptions on the rates, which is why we didn’t say anything other than – we’ve got draft rates but nothing official, Tom. So I don’t want to speculate.
Mario Molina:  We don’t generally quote things like that until the ink is dry on the contract. So that’s why we are holding off.
John Molina:  And as far as Michigan, the rate increase was not tied to any specific provider rate increase. So it’s not a complete pass-through. But I’m sure that some of it to the extent that the provider rates do go up, we passed on.
Tom Carroll – Stifel Nicolaus:  So what do you think the net impact will be at Michigan? Is that up?
John Molina:  We would think it will be a positive.
Mario Molina:  Yes, there will be some net positive effect.
Tom Carroll – Stifel Nicolaus:  Okay, thank you.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from John Rex of J.P. Morgan.
John Rex – J.P. Morgan:  Thanks. I want to just focus on Washington for a moment here. I suppose that rate process is ongoing right now. Could you just give us a little color, remind us of the timeline here, I think it’s a Jan. 1 renewal? And then maybe a little bit about the environment right now so we can get some expectations for them?
John Molina:  Washington is a Jan.1 rate year. I think we’ve got the draft rates in and are commenting on them, John. At this point, I don’t have a specific number for Washington.
John Rex – J.P. Morgan:  I mean, I guess should we have an expectation – margins aren’t fairly decent and not planned. Just given the broader environment, would one have an expectation that could possibly be a down rate?
John Molina:  I don’t think we have any expectation until we see all the information from the state. And I just don’t think we want to speculate on what it looks like.
John Rex – J.P. Morgan:  Any color just in terms of what you are seeing in the – so moving away from that specific Medicaid, but just what you are seeing more globally in the budgeting process in Washington state right now and the challenges they are having?
Mario Molina:  Well, I think the State of Washington like most states is going to face some budget challenges. And they will probably address those after the first of the year.
John Rex – J.P. Morgan:  All right. Okay. By that you're implying not potentially part of this rate cycle for you?
Mario Molina:  I don’t think so, but you never know.
John Rex – J.P. Morgan:  Okay, okay, that’s fine. I just want to be clear on California and the expectation here. So, should we expect then kind of when you think about the post injunction rate that you are recording, should we expect then as long as the injunction holds? Should that PMPM go back up again then in the 4Q?
Joseph White:  It’s Joe. That’s a fair statement. It should be consistent – as long as the injunction holds, it should be consistent with what we saw the first half of the year.
John Rex – J.P. Morgan:  Okay.
John Molina:  Yes. No, let me add something though. I mean, first of all, that injunction is a big if. We don’t know which way it’s going to go. But second, October 1 is our normal rate cycle for California. And so we need to see in addition to what happened with the July 1 rate issues, what’s going to happen for October 1, how is that going to roll out. And our San Diego contract is a negotiated rate and we are still working on that. So that’s retro to July 1. So capital [ph] rates going to a little bit murky for a little while still.
John Rex – J.P. Morgan:  Okay. And then back to the question that Josh had in the beginning of the call. So, what would be kind of – give us maybe then kind of the reasoning around the $0.20 band on the 4Q in terms of kind of what are the negative scenarios and the positive scenarios that create that kind of fluctuation in your outlook for the fourth quarter, just so we can kind of be thinking why we would have that kind of band.
Mario Molina:  Well, I don’t want you to take away from this that we’re saying that’s a $0.20 band on the fourth quarter. What we’re really saying I think is that we are tracking in line for the first nine months of the year. And so we see no reason to change guidance.
John Rex – J.P. Morgan:  Okay. But there is no specific things you’d point to that say, hey, this is why it would be $0.72 and this is why it would be $0.52?
Mario Molina:  No, we are not seeing any material changes. I think it’s – things are stable, tracking in line. We are running towards the midpoint of guidance, and we think that’s where we are going to end up at the end of the year.
John Rex – J.P. Morgan:  Okay, great. Perfect. Thanks.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Wright of Banc of America Securities.
Brian Wright – Banc of America Securities:  Thanks. Is it possible that you are seeing a positive member mix issue as far as your average kind of claims per member kind of size, with kind of the changing demographics in the Medicaid population, given the increase in the unemployment rate? Do you think that there is something going on with that?
Mario Molina:  That’s a really good question. And I don’t know. I think it’s probably too early to tell. We probably have to wait until next year. One of the things that I think you are seeing though is as our claims inventory is dropping, we are also paying the larger claims, the hospital claims faster as well. And that’s part of the reason that not only is the inventory dropping, but the cost per claim in inventory is coming down as well. So you are seeing both those effects.
Brian Wright – Banc of America Securities:  Is there any sort of recent medical management initiatives that would prevent getting to out their payments more effectively than you have in past years or anything like that?
Mario Molina:  No, I don’t think so. And I think we are continuing to do the same things. We follow every patient in the hospital every day in every state. And I think if you look at the Ohio experience, one of the things we learned when we got an influx of members was that not everyone is managing their hospital days as carefully as we are.
Brian Wright – Banc of America Securities:  Okay, all right. Thank you.
Operator:  (Operator instructions) Our next question comes from Carl Mcdonald of Oppenheimer.
Carl Mcdonald – Oppenheimer:  Thanks. Would you mind walking us through how the conversion process in Florida will work from the ASO model to the risk model? Some specific questions. Can you have both an ASO and a risk model at the same time? I know some states don’t allow that. Will it be something that happens over an elongated period, or is it a specific date that a choice has to be made?
Mario Molina:  There is a lot of questions in there, Carl. The short answer is, we cannot have the ASO model and the fully Cap model in the same counties at the same time. So letters were sent out and will continue to be sent out on a county-by-county basis, given the patients the option to either to disenroll back into MediPass or they will be automatically rolled over into Molina’s full risk program.
Carl Mcdonald – Oppenheimer:  And will the rollout happen at the same time in all counties or do you expect that will be elongated?
Mario Molina:  No, it will go – we are hoping that we can get it done in about four months.
Carl Mcdonald – Oppenheimer:  Okay. And any sense of the 55,000? What you think a decent retention number would look like?
Mario Molina:  Well, this is the first time, I think, in Florida we’re really seeing this type of situation. We think we’ve got – because of the network overlaps between what we’ve got and what Florida NetPASS had, we think that there is a good chance we will get a very good rollover.
Carl Mcdonald – Oppenheimer:  Okay. And then the second question is, I know you guys tend to have M&A discussions over a long period of time, in some cases years. Has there been any change in the tone of the discussion over the last couple of months as the economy has turned?
Mario Molina:  No. It’s fairly remarkable. The hospitals have the same attitude. Every seller has the attitude that their baby is the most beautiful one on the block. And we just keep going back to our same principles that we’ve used every time. We’re fairly consistent, Carl, in our M&A practices use every [ph] year.
Carl Mcdonald – Oppenheimer:  Great. Thank you.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Morey of Cowen Asset Management. Please go ahead.
Andrew Morey – Cowen Asset Management:  Yes, thanks for taking my question. On Ohio, I might have missed part of your description earlier in the call. But the changes in your network on the behavioral side, is that enough of a fix? I guess because I’m just looking at a 91.5 MCR and just thinking roughly kind of a 7.5% or 8.0% SG&A. So it wouldn't appear that you're really earning any money there currently. So I guess the question is, are those network changes enough or do you need to do other things in Ohio?
Mario Molina:  Well, I don’t think it’s primarily the network. We talked in Ohio about a number of things that are going to help us. We have done some provider recontracting, which is going to lower unit cost. Those contracts went into effect in mid-September. And so you really haven’t had a chance to see that yet. The other change we did was to bring behavioral health in-house. And as I alluded to earlier, we think that we manage things a little more tightly than most, and we can help bring down costs by tighter utilization management and making more appropriate use of the resources that are available in Ohio for behavioral health. And the third thing is the risk-adjusted payments for the ABD patients, which has gone up. And we’ll add about $500,000 a month I believe in additional revenue. So those combination of things we think will begin to show an impact in the fourth quarter in 2008. Some of those things went into effect at the end of the third quarter, but really haven’t been around long enough to have any impact on third quarter results.
Terry Bayer:  I just want to add a comment that the recontracting is broader than behavioral health. It sounded like your question might have been asking for the specific to behavioral health. While we have network changes to bring behavioral in-house, Dr. Molina’s first point related to the recontracting was broader recontracting.
Andrew Morey – Cowen Asset Management:  Okay, thank you for that clarification.
Operator:  Thank you. Our final question comes from Scott Fidel of Deutsche Bank.
Scott Fidel – Deutsche Bank:  Thanks. I just want to follow up on California, and did you basically say that you are reinstating the higher provider payments, given the injunction? And just wondering how this works if the cuts end up going back through, you basically just go back to those lower reimbursement rates, and how much timing does it take to adjust based on what California is doing with these rates relative to your provider reimbursements?
Mario Molina:  Well, right now we have rolled back the contracts to the ones that we had before. We do have the ability if we need to institute the new contracts if the state does reinstitute the 10% provider cut. I personally think that’s unlikely. But we have the ability to make the change and we’ll take sometime because you’ve got to change computer systems. But we've done it once, we reversed it once, and we can do it again if we need to.
Scott Fidel – Deutsche Bank:  Okay. So basically it’s a bit of a – it will be a bit of a roller coaster around those reimbursements right now?
Mario Molina:  Yes, but I suspect that it’s more likely than not that the injunction will be upheld.
Scott Fidel – Deutsche Bank:  Okay. And I just had a follow-up just around the DC and I’m talking the second stimulus package. Maybe if you can give us an update on what you are hearing around what that can include around Medicaid?
Mario Molina:  That’s a really good question. Both the House and the Senate have proposed to increase federal matching funds for Medicaid in the neighborhood of $14 billion to perhaps as much as $20 billion. And that may get put into the package for the stimulus. That I think would be helpful. All the states would like to see more federal dollars put into the Medicaid programs. It helps them and they are having a tough time. But it remains to be seen if that’s going to pass.
Scott Fidel – Deutsche Bank:  Do you have any sense of what that would do for the map? I know it’s 57% federal right now, where that would take it to if that went through?
Mario Molina:  I’m not sure out of top of my head, and it also varies on a state-by-state basis as well.
Scott Fidel – Deutsche Bank:  Right. Okay, thanks.
Mario Molina:  Okay. Thank you, everyone. We’ll see next quarter.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today’s conference call. We thank you for your participation and we ask that you please disconnect your line.

This call is being recorded and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available over the Internet through the company's website, at www.molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina.
Mario Molina: Thank you, Juan Jose, and hello, everyone. I am pleased to report that our business continues to perform well, as evidenced by our second quarter earnings of $0.59 per share. As I assess our performance midyear, I am also very pleased with the company's consistent execution. Our focus on execution should not only carry our performance momentum into the second half of 2008, but will also enable us to achieve our longer term growth and profitability objectives. As you know, we emphasize reporting transparency, and we have consistently reported on both our successes and our challenges. During our last two company Investor Day conferences, I have gone over with you our strategic plan and its five main goals. We have often used the framework of our strategic plan to measure our company's progress. During today's remarks, John and I will use the framework of our strategic plan to discuss our financial and operating results. The five areas of focus under our strategic plan are growth, financial strength, customer service, compliance and quality. Now, I would like to turn the call over to John, so that he can discuss with you our financial performance for the second quarter, our guidance, as well as the growth, financial strength and customer service elements of our strategic plan. After John concludes his remarks, I will make some additional comments and discuss compliance and quality. 
John Molina: Thank you, Mario. Good afternoon, everyone. Let me begin by highlighting our earnings, and then move on to our quarterly financial performance as it relates to our strategic plan. Results for the second quarter of 2008 were $0.59 per diluted share, representing a year-over-year growth of 24%. Net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 increased to $17 million compared to $13 million in the same quarter last year. As Mario just mentioned, one of the key areas of focus in our strategic plan is growth, which also leads to diversification in revenue and enrollment. Premium revenues for the second quarter of 2008 increased by $154 million to $761 million. This is a 25% increase when compared to the second quarter of 2007. Contributing to this revenue increase were organic growth, growth in our Medicare product, growth in new populations and growth from our Missouri acquisition. Our consolidated membership grew by nearly 8% year-over-year even without the Missouri health plan. On a sequential basis, including Missouri, our membership grew by approximately 4%. This enrollment gain is significant both on a year-over-year and sequential basis since our historical full year organic growth rate have been in the range of 3% to 4%. Our Medicare line of business is also experiencing steady growth. Medicare premium revenues have more than doubled since the second quarter of 2007, growing to approximately $23 million in the second quarter of 2008 with enrollment of approximately 7,000 members. As a reminder, our Medicare business focuses primarily on special needs and other low income populations under managed care contracts with CMS. We do not participate in a private fee-for-service Medicare segment. Revenue and enrollment growth associated with new states like our Missouri acquisition and new populations like the Ohio ABD population have also made meaningful contributions in our pursuit of greater diversification. Our diversification strategy is focused on reducing our revenue reliance from each of our states to no more than 15% of total revenue. Our entry into the Missouri market, combined with our organic growth in Ohio and in Medicare, has reduced our revenue reliance on our larger states; California, Michigan and Washington. A year ago, these health plans represented 62% of total revenue, while today California, Michigan and Washington only represent 54%. The second area of focus in our strategic plan is financial strength. To succeed, we must be efficient and manage medical costs, while controlling administrative costs. Our medical care ratio decreased to 84.2% in the second quarter of 2008 from 85.1% in the second quarter of 2007. Sequentially, the medical care ratio decreased from 85.8% in the quarter ended March 31, 2008, a decrease of 160 basis points. Lower medical care costs at our Michigan, Missouri, New Mexico and Texas health plans more than offset higher medical costs in California and Ohio, underscoring the benefits of our focus on geographic diversification. General and administrative expenses in the second quarter were 11.4% of total revenue or $87 million as compared to 10.9% of total revenue for the second quarter of 2007 or $67 million. Core G&A expenses, defined as G&A expenses less premium taxes, increased to 8.2% of total revenue for the second quarter of 2008 as compared to 7.7% for the second quarter of 2007. The increase in G&A expenses was the result of continued infrastructure investments necessary to support our growing Medicare business and also an increase in the accrual for incentive compensation due to the company's improving financial performance. We recorded an effective tax rate of 40.9% for the second quarter of 2008, bringing our year-to-date effective tax rate to 40.8%. This rate is significantly higher than the tax rate in 2007. As we discussed last quarter, the higher tax rate is due to the change in the Michigan state tax calculation methodology effective January 1, 2008. Cash flow provided by operating activities for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 was $39 million compared with cash flow from operations totaling $88 million for the same period in 2007, a decrease of $49 million. The decline was primarily due to three items. First, the timing of the receipt of premiums recorded as deferred revenue in Ohio and Washington, netting a $16 million decline year-over-year; second, the reversal of $13 million accrued costs relating to the minimum medical care ratio contract provisions in New Mexico in the first half of 2008; and third, the maturation of our operations in Texas and Ohio during the first half of 2008. As enrollment grew at these health plans during 2007, medical expense outpaced claims payment, leading to an increase in claims liabilities. Now that enrollment has stabilized, claims payment has caught up with expense and cash flow is at the level we expect in a mature health plan. The company had cash and investments of approximately $688 million at June 30, 2008. The parent company had cash and investments of approximately $76 million. We repurchased about 1.1 million shares of our common stock for approximately $30 million at an average cost of $26.50 per share during the second quarter of 2008. Shares used for computing diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2008 were 28 million versus 28.3 million in the second quarter of 2007. This demonstrates minimal impact of the share repurchase on EPS for the second quarter. Our Board of Directors has authorized us to buy up to 1 million additional shares. Our stock purchase program continues to be an attractive use of cash and underscores our belief in the long-term value of our stock as well as our commitment to deliver shareholder value. I want to address the issue of claims payment. Service is part of our strategic plan. We want to pay our providers promptly and our claim statistics demonstrate that we are paying more promptly. Measures of claims inventory continues to decline. Specifically, the number of claims in inventory and bill charges of claims in inventory have declined year-over-year. Also, claims in inventory per member have decreased by 50% from 2007. We are increasing our guidance for the full year 2008 to the range of $2.20 to $2.40 per diluted share. Improved financial performance at a number of our health plans including Michigan, Missouri, New Mexico and Texas, partially offset by higher administrative costs principally related to increased accruals for incentive compensation, have resulted in the revision of guidance. I want to caution you that we have not yet received official notification from the State of Michigan as to the new rates under our contract effective as of October 1, 2008, the impact of risk adjustors on those rates or of any remediation of our Michigan business tax issues. We think, however, that the new contract rates effective October 1, 2008 will include an overall increase of approximately 3% for health plans. However, our Michigan plans final contract rates may differ depending on our risk scores. We also think that the new rates will include going for remediation of the Michigan business tax issue starting on October 1, 2008 that is not included in the 3%. However, until we receive official confirmation of this, we will continue to accrue taxes for the full Michigan business tax. Also, there have been discussions with the Michigan Department of Community Health about the Michigan tax remediation on historic basis for the first nine months of 2008. To-date, these discussions have been inconclusive. We have previously based our guidance projection on a 1.5% rate increase in Michigan. The possibility that a risk adjusted rate increase could exceed 1.5% and that we may receive relief on the Michigan business tax are among the factors contributing to the $0.20 spread between the low-end and the high-end of our guidance range. Now let me turn the call back to Mario.
Mario Molina: Thank you, John. My congratulations to you and all of our employees for the strong performance in the second quarter. Now, let me give everyone an update on a couple of other issues. In California the legislation eliminating the proposed fee-for-service provider rate cuts as well as providing for a managed care rate increase has been agreed to by the conference committee, representing both Houses of the State Legislature. However, any changes to the Medi-Cal rates are wrapped up in the California budget negotiations and both the outcome of the negotiations and the timing for the adoption of the budget is uncertain. Despite this uncertainty, the management team at our California health plan is making progress implementing the plan for mitigating the revenue impact of the proposed cuts. This plan includes the implementation of provider fee reductions to fee-for-service and capitated providers, new medical management initiatives and administrative cost reductions. We continue to be hopeful of both the rescission of the cuts and ultimately a rate increase. I continue to be encouraged by the progress we are making in Ohio in establishing ourselves as a trusted Medicaid partner with the state despite a challenging medical cost environment. We are not immune to the challenges facing our peer companies in Ohio. However, we believe the medical management initiatives coupled with administrative efficiency will allow us to establish profitability in the long run. Our data suggest that the majority of our difficulties are in Ohio's central region, specifically, unit costs in this region remain higher than in other regions. In addition, the implementation of risk adjustors by the State has decreased the estimated benefits from the midyear rate adjustment that became effective on July 1. Finally, higher than anticipated behavioral health costs have also unfavorably contributed to the Ohio health plans current medical cost profile. Our management team at Ohio has implemented several key initiatives to lower our medical care costs. These include renegotiating provider contracts, tighter medical management and bringing the behavioral health component in-house on September 1, 2008. Over our 27-year history, we have learned to assess our business in the same manner that investors assess their investments; as a portfolio. In some cases, some investments will outperform others in the portfolio, thus minimizing the risks and optimizing the return. So what's the point? The point is that in the Molina's health plan portfolio, California and Ohio represent approximately 24% of our medical margin on a year-to-date basis. This indicates that over 75% of our medical margin is currently being generated by other health plans that are performing at or above expectations. As John said and it bears repeating, we continue to hold the line on our core administrative costs, and we expect to gain additional leverage as our enrollment continues to grow. Our total enrollment is up 4% sequentially from last quarter with membership increasing in the majority of our health plans. Historically, organic growth rates, absent large RFPs, have been in the range of 3% to 4% for the entire year. Our commitment to keep our administrative cost low drives our financial strength and, ultimately it is what enables us to outlast temporary market fluctuations created by budgetary uncertainties or higher than anticipated medical costs. The two final elements of our strategic plan are compliance and quality. In the highly competitive and regulated environment in which we operate it is essential to maintain a reputation for compliance among all stakeholders. Our members entrust us with one of their most prized possessions; their health. Our state partners entrust us with public funds and expect us to be prudent stewards of those resources. Likewise, our shareholders entrust us with their hard earned capital. We take these responsibilities very seriously and constantly strive to operate in a manner consistent with all applicable financial and industry requirements and standards. I am happy to report that we continue to enjoy positive relationships with multiple agencies that license and regulate us, and we also have an excellent track record with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are not subject to any government investigations or lawsuits, and we routinely collaborate with regulators on how to improve our industry and the care we provide to our members. Our long-term success will depend on the quality of services we provide. It is, for us, important that our health plans continue to maintain their accreditation by the National Committee for Quality Assurance, which is the industry leader in assessing quality measures of health plans. I assure you that maintaining our NCQA accreditations will continue to be an ongoing and continuous focus. This concludes our prepared remarks. Tim, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Lehman Brothers. Please proceed.
Josh Raskin - Lehman Brothers: Hi, thanks. Good evening. Three questions, I guess. The first just a quick one, I think it's easy. New Mexico, I'm just a little confused by the accounting for that one, the $6.2 million that I'm talking about. Why is that a revenue boost and not a cost, if it's a minimum MLR? I think I'm missing out on how it works.
Joe White: Hi, Josh. This is Joe White speaking. The requirement in New Mexico is that funds that exceed to the extent we fall below a certain minimum medical loss ratio we have to return the appropriate piece of the revenue to the state. So, for example, if we had $100 of revenue and $79 of medical expense, we would calculate the revenue due from the state based on in effect taking that $79 and dividing it by 0.8 and that is the appropriate amount of revenue we can recognize. So that's the difference between that and what the state pays us is what we owe the state back.
Josh Raskin - Lehman Brothers: Okay. I got you. So I think I did understand it, I just didn't get the mechanics. Second question just on the higher comp accruals on the SG&A, they came a little bit higher. Now, obviously the guidance today is still sort of $0.05 below the original year. But am I correct in assuming that the updated guidance last quarter included lower comp expense and now you're getting back a portion of that? Is that the way it works?
Joe White: That's correct.
Josh Raskin - Lehman Brothers: Okay. That's an easy one, and then just the last one. Just on Ohio, obviously, you guys are looking at sort of a 91% MLR overall in the first half of the year and you'd suggest a goal of 88%, sounds like that's going to be sort of tough to get to, obviously. Ohio is a big market, a couple of hundred basis points here is a lot. So I'm just curious in terms of the new goals for Ohio, you talked about being a long-term partner with the state and I think long-term financially viable, but when is the cut-off, is the first question, and then what are the other states that are making up what I calculate to be somewhere between $0.35 and $0.40 this year?
John Molina: Josh, I think that the answer to the first part of your question is when would we say enough is enough is when we determine that there is not long-term financial viability in the state. We certainly haven't reached that point in Ohio. And as I stated, as far as one of the reasons that we are upping our guidance is because plants such as New Mexico, Missouri, Michigan and Texas are outperforming our original expectations. And so, again, it gets back to what Mario talked about in the portfolio theory in our geographic diversification. Some might not be performing as well like Ohio, but we've got others that are continuing to chug along.
Josh Raskin - Lehman Brothers: Okay. I guess I was just looking at second quarter MLRs for the other states that you mentioned. It didn't look like there was a magnitude there to sort of make it up, but I guess it's just generally spread across the other states?
John Molina: Correct.
Mario Molina: Correct.
Josh Raskin - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Thanks
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Nersessian with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse: Hi, thanks. Good evening. Just the first question, just to follow-up on Josh's question regarding the New Mexico accrual. I mean, I guess, how much of that do you sort of view as kind of one-time this year that would not necessarily be recurring going forward into 2009? Because you had 6.2 this quarter, I think you had, what, 5.8 last quarter or something like that?
Joe White: Correct. It's a little over $12 million. This is Joe speaking. It's a little over $12 million taken into the year. So that is, as we anticipated, exhausted by the close of the first half of the year. So there won't be any benefit from that going forward.
Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse: Okay. So presumably the New Mexico MLR should migrate back up into that kind of 85% level or maybe a little bit higher going forward, is that right?
Joe White: Probably the way the contract is structured a little bit below 85%, but definitely increasing.
Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse: Mid 80s, okay. And then, I guess, on the auction rate issue, I mean is any of that going to impact your working capital in terms of the regulated subsidiaries or are you well overcapitalized there? I mean is that an issue?
Joe White: No, we haven't had any indication that those assets are not acceptable for any [IC] minimum networks requirements.
Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse: Okay. And then, I think, you mentioned that the Michigan tax change goes into effect October 1. Does that mean that fourth quarter we revert back to kind of your historical tax rate, is that what we should be building into our model?
Joe White: Right now, Greg, we don't know for sure. We haven't received confirmation that that's going to happen. But if it does get inactive, we believe that the rates starting October 1 will normalize to where it's been historically. There's also a piece going back for the first three quarters. That's a separate issue that needs to be addressed as well.
Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse: Right. Okay. So that would be kind of like a one-time adjustment, and then if you get --
John Molina: Greg, the second piece would be a one-time adjustment if they fix the historic.
Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse: Okay.
Mario Molina: But I'd say just to make clear on what John said, there seems to be more momentum now about adjusting our actual premium rate rather than going back and changing the Michigan tax code. So what you're going to see is the Michigan Funding Authority is, we're hopeful, going to increase our payment, so you are going to see it on the premium line not in the income. The income tax will still remain high as a percentage.
Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse: Okay. Is that in the 3% number that you mentioned or would that be on top of that?
Mario Molina: That would be on top of that.
Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse: Okay. But the current guidance range is still assuming the 40.6 for the full year tax rate, right?
Mario Molina: The guidance actually if you will see in the release is 41.7. There are certain ambiguities about the Michigan situation that could increase the tax. I would just say that the reason we have a range, as John noted in his remarks, is to encompass these different eventualities. So I think it's fair to say that to the extent that's not from all things being equal to the extent that's not remediated we're going to show be it towards the lower end to the extent it's remediated or towards the higher end. So that's actually why we have a range.
Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse: Okay, great. And then, Mario, if you could just touch on what you sort of view as the next steps in terms of the California budget situation, in terms of where that negotiation goes from here? And that will be it for me. Thanks.
Mario Molina: Well, we were talking about that earlier. The California budget situation comes down to a negotiation between what's called the "Big Five," the leadership of the Republicans and the Democrats in both Houses plus the Governor, who get together to negotiate out any final budget differences, and then that is returned to the Legislature for passage. It then goes to the Governor for signature, and the Governor does have the right to do what is called blue-pencil or line item veto certain things. But I expect that we will have a budget in August or September. This is really no different than what happens every year, and unfortunately, it generates a lot of headline risks for us. But it seems like almost every year the budget is late, but it does get passed and these things work themselves out.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Daryn Miller with Goldman Sachs.
Daryn Miller - Goldman Sachs: Hi, good evening. Joe, a question for you, following up on the question Josh asked on incentive comp. Your adjusted guidance was looking for a $0.10 pickup due to lower incentive comp accruals. What does that number look like now with you guys booking more incentive comp?
Joe White: I'm sorry. Repeat that question, Daryn. You are talking about what we shared the last time we were out on guidance.
Daryn Miller - Goldman Sachs: Correct. You had looked for total admin savings of like $0.19. Approximately half of that or $0.10 was for lower incentive comps.
Joe White: So we've moved midpoint up to 2.30. So essentially half of that difference would go back.
Daryn Miller - Goldman Sachs: So about $0.05?
Joe White: Roughly.
Daryn Miller - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Question on California, going back to the updated guidance you were trimming guidance by $0.10 on issues that were going on in California, which assumed that you would be successful in renegotiating some of your contracts. Can you talk just in terms of how successful those renegotiations have been, and are you on pace to only have the 10% reduction, assuming that none of the other activities flow through in California?
Terry Bayer: This is Terry. I will respond to that question. We're proceeding with the plan that we outlined at our Investor Day. On the 10% rate cut to fee-for-service providers, that's put into our system and we're proceeding until we have an indication that that is not to go forward. And that's not a contract change, that's the rates, the Medi-Cal fee schedule. So we loaded the Medi-Cal fee schedule 10% lower. And on the reductions that we negotiated with our capitated providers, we have moved forward as planned and over 85% of those have been returned. So we are proceeding to mitigate the $0.10 until we know differently.
Daryn Miller - Goldman Sachs: So in relation to that $0.10, is that 85% successful recontracting higher or lower than what you had originally assumed?
Terry Bayer: It's not significantly different, because if you recall we had some medical management initiatives and we had administrative cost cuts. And in some of those areas, it is exceeding our original estimate so we are on target to mitigate the risk.
Daryn Miller - Goldman Sachs: Got you. When I look at where the Street is on '08 and the Street is on '09 and I think about a couple of items in '08 that may be considered one-timeish, maybe the $0.25 in New Mexico and $0.05 in incentive comp, it implies more than a 30% increase. I just wondered if you can just help kind of walk through what's going to contribute to that 30% growth.
John Molina: Daryn, we haven't given 2009 guidance and I hate to comment on what the Street's put out. What I will say is we've got our plan, as Mario says, the portfolio theory, and we are just continuing to execute on our strategic plan.
Daryn Miller - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thanks. One last question, John, just in relation to you guys bought back a little over 1 million shares of stock. Can you just talk about how you think about the value of the stock at the current levels and just reconcile that with what would seem like it's been an uptick on insider sales on the shares. Thanks.
John Molina: Sure. I think that given the fact that the Board has authorized us to buy another million shares that we believe that the stock overall is undervalued. In terms of individual selling, a lot of that is the 10b5-1 plans that are on autopilot.
Daryn Miller - Goldman Sachs: Just a follow-up question on that, because the 10b5-1 plan, if you look at the rate, there's not a pattern that is apparent. How does that work in terms of those automatic plans that are established? I would tend to think that we'd see more consistent rate of selling and amount of shares that are sold?
John Molina: I think that that would have to go to the individuals in the trust that have set those things up. I can't speak to it. The 10b5-1s can be shaped in different ways and different people have shaped theirs in different ways. But once it's in place, the sellers don't have the ability to alter those items from month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter.
Daryn Miller - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you, John.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And our next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel Nicolaus.
Tom Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus: Hi, good evening, everyone. Most of my questions have been answered, but a quick follow-up on the Michigan tax issue. It sounds like you guys are leaning towards them adding to your rate and having you use that as a pass-through to pay the higher taxes rather than get some kind of lump sum that would be retroactive, I mean is that true? I mean it sounds like you guys are going back and forth on that in your conversation so far today, but it sounds like maybe it's going to be forward-looking and it's not going to be retroactive. Would that be your gut?
John Molina: No, Tom. There's two pieces of it. The first piece would take effect, if enacted, on October 1, 2008. It would be a higher premium rate to the health plan that can be then used to cover the higher tax on a go-forward basis.
Tom Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus: Right. So a piece in addition to the 3%?
John Molina: Correct.
Tom Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay.
John Molina: The Michigan Department of Community Health and the health plans have been discussing a way to remediate the first three quarters of the year. We don't know how that's going to resolve itself. The folks from MDCH have told us they would like to try and do something, but the mechanism and the amount are still under discussion. But that would be a separate item. That would be one-time if it's enacted.
Tom Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. So it sounds like there might be three pieces then. A regular rate increase, an increase of 1%, 1.5% or something like that for future remediation, and then a third piece that would capture retroactivity back through the year.
John Molina: You could characterize it that way. You're not going to see that on the income statement. Starting October 1 though you will see a single increase in premium.
Tom Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. That's good. I was just trying to get some more clarification on that. I'm done. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Rex with JPMorgan.
John Rex - JPMorgan: Hi. Thanks. Just a couple of follow-ups on guidance. I wanted to make sure I understood it. John, I just want to get again what you mentioned on kind of the difference between the high-end and the low-end of the guidance, what the swing factor was there?
John Molina: The swing factor includes things like Michigan, it includes like what the Texas rate ends up being, what we get for Medicare and some other things. Joe, anything you want to throw in there?
Joe White: Yeah, I mean there is a brief summary of this, John, on the ER, but essentially we talk about rate issues in California, Michigan and Texas, how Ohio cost trends develop and the Michigan issue, I think, would be the three biggest categories.
John Rex - JPMorgan: I mean, actually, what I was trying to clarify is what is the high-end contemplate in terms of resolution on Michigan? Does that contemplate retroactivity, I'm just trying to think kind of how much swing there is for Michigan?
Joe White: If we were to isolate the Michigan tax issue, we talked at our last call about the impact of that being about $0.08 for the year, looking at our guidance the proportional or relative increase of Michigan profitability during this year is actually driving that number up a little bit in our projections now. My best bet is that tax issue is ultimately going to shake out at potentially a $0.12 impact for the year. Again, as Michigan is proportionally more profitable, the tax bite grows. So theoretically, I guess you could have a $0.12 swing on Michigan taxes alone.
John Rex - JPMorgan: Right. And so the high-end would essentially anticipate retroactivity. Would that be the right way to think about it that you get a retroactive payment for that?
Joe White: I mean there are a lot of factors in there.
John Molina: John, let me see if I can answer that question a different way. If the Michigan tax gets resolved, will that lead us to automatically raise guidance? No. It is in itself not a necessary nor a sufficient condition that would cause us to change guidance. But it is a piece.
John Rex - JPMorgan: Okay. And does the guidance still anticipate two interest rate cuts this year?
Mario Molina: The guidance anticipates we're done with interest rate cuts.
John Rex - JPMorgan: That's a change from where you were before, right?
Mario Molina: I think last time we went out, we were anticipating another 0.25 point cut, July 1?
Terry Bayer: Right.
Mario Molina: July 1. We removed that.
John Rex - JPMorgan: You removed that. Isn't that worth like about $0.08 a share?
John Molina: Yes. But, John, you also have to take into account that our share repurchase happened sooner. So we've got less cash for investment. The difficulty with trying to parse out the different elements of what builds us exactly up to our guidance is there are so many potential combinations and permutations.
John Rex - JPMorgan: Right. Okay. So it wouldn't be fair just to say that I could take the low-end of the guidance coming up is mostly about the declining rate, it's obviously about the removal of one of the rate cuts it's kind of all of these factors then?
John Molina: Yeah. Isolating one thing would not be fair nor accurate.
Joe White: And if you were to go back and look at what we've talked about rates, John, you mathematically can't get there from the elimination of one quarter.
John Rex - JPMorgan: Yeah.
Joe White: It's not that's significant.
John Rex - JPMorgan: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Dr. Molina we have no further questions. I'll turn the call back over to you.
Mario Molina: Well, thank you for joining us everyone. We will talk to you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you all for your participation, and we now ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a great day, everyone.

Operator:  Welcome to the Molina Healthcare first quarter 2008 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would like to turn the conference over to Dr. Mario Molina, President and CEO, Molina Healthcare. 
J. Mario Molina, M.D.: The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare’s financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2008. The company’s earnings release, reporting its results, was issued today after market close, and is now posted for viewing on our company website. On the call with me today are several members of our executive management team including, John Molina, our CFO; Terry Bayer, our COO; Dr. Michael Siegel, our Corporate Vice President and Medical Director who will be sitting in for Dr. Howard, our Chief Medical Officer; and Joe White, our Chief Accounting Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. Juan José Orellana, our Vice President of Investor Relations is unable to join us today. I would like to caution you that our comments today contain numerous forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions, and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risks and uncertainties can be found in our 2007 Form 10-K annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as in the earnings release and in the Form 10-Q and Form 8-K reports we filed with the SEC. All of these reports and filings can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab of our company website or the SEC’s website.  All forward-looking statements made during today’s call represent our judgment as of April 29, 2008 and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements. This call is being recorded and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available over the Internet through the company’s website at www.molinahealthcare.com. We are pleased that our first quarter results demonstrate continued solid performance. Our earnings for the first quarter were $0.46 per share, representing a 35% increase over the first quarter of 2007. We attribute much of our performance in the first quarter to our strategy of becoming more diversified both in terms of geography and membership, and increasing our sources of revenue, as well as effectively controlling our administrative costs and managing our medical costs. We continue to benefit from the revenue diversification strategy. In the first quarter $52 million of the $173 million increase in year-over-year premium revenue came from our Missouri heath plan. And about $50 million of that increase came from our Ohio health plan. In particular, that plan’s aged, blind, and disabled population. These two factors account for 60% of our year-over-year premium growth. We’re also very pleased with the company’s organic membership growth this quarter. We achieved sequential membership growth in each health plan market with the exception of Texas and Utah. Californian enrollment is at his highest point in nearly two years. Overall, we were able to achieve a 3% sequential growth in membership. In the second quarter of 2008, we expect additional organic membership growth highlighted by growth in our Ohio plan of approximately 35,000 members. Members were transferred to our Ohio health plan as a result of WellPoint’s exit from the Ohio central region. At this point it is too early to know how many of these members will be retained, but we are pleased with the initial growth. Medicare continues to show steady sequential growth and now contributes 3% of overall premium revenue compared to 1.6% in the first quarter of 2007. As we’ve discussed, it has been our experience that some companies are unable to make their business economics work in a difficult reimbursement environment and thus decide to exit certain of their markets. The exit of such competitors provides us with a membership growth opportunity, as has occurred in San Diego, Sacramento, and now in Ohio. We continue to believe that our administrative efficiency gives us an advantage during tough economic times, and it also enables us to capitalize on such growth opportunities. We were disappointed to learn that the joint bids we made with UAHC Health Plan of Tennessee for the West and East regions in Tennessee were not selected for a contract award by the TennCare Bureau. We would like to remind everyone that there is no financial impact to Molina as a result of this outcome. We are continuing to evaluate other business opportunities in both new and existing states. Another important contributing factor to our success in the first quarter was our ability to manage our medical costs. Today’s press release includes a detailed state-by-state review of our medical costs and provides some brief narrative to assist you in better understanding our business. We believe the three key takeaways regarding our medical costs are: number one, the consolidated medical care ratio was flat year-over-year despite the growth in the aged, blind, and disabled population. Number two, the medical care ratio in Michigan declined year-over-year; and number three, medical costs in Ohio were flat on a sequential basis and lower year-over-year. Our aged, blind, and disabled enrollment grew by 13% from the first quarter of 2007. Most of this enrollment gain was in our Ohio health plan. Premiums for aged, blind, and disabled populations are higher than those for TANF populations, but they also have higher associated medical costs. Medical care ratios for the ABD population start out higher as these populations transition from fee-for-service to managed care. We believe that we can bring MCRs down, as we work with patients and providers to reduce unnecessary utilization in managed care principals such as case management. Despite a significant increase in our ABD enrollment, we were able to keep our MCR essentially flat from a year ago. In Ohio, our medical care ratio was lower, both on a year-over-year basis, as well as sequentially. Our efforts in Ohio have focused on more intense medical management, especially in the areas of complex radiology, pain management, and concurrent inpatient review. We continue to carefully manage our pharmacy benefits and we have renegotiated contracts with certain providers. These efforts have led to an overall reduction in our Ohio medical care ratio. We have provided additional disclosure around our Ohio MCR. This has been a key area as we discussed when we provided our initial guidance in January. We have entered two new counties in Michigan and enrollment is up 7000 members sequentially from the fourth quarter. The medical care ratio in Michigan decreased year-over-year and medical costs decreased sequentially from $163 PMPM in the fourth quarter of 2007, to $161 PMPM in the first quarter of 2008.  Our Michigan plan has seen a decrease in inpatient utilization perhaps helped by intensive case management programs for patients with congestive heart failure, and a new hospital discharge outreach program to ensure that members get needed follow-up care after a hospital stay. Historically the company has experienced its highest consolidated medical care ratio during the first quarter of the year.  I want to spend some time to make a few general comments about the flu season. In the first quarter of 2005, we saw a marked increase in medical costs that we attributed in part to the flu season. Since that time, monitoring the flu season has garnered increasing attention in the industry.  When we talk about the flu season, we’re referring to seasonal increases in the respiratory illnesses that typically begin in late November and run through the end of February. This leads to higher utilization of acute care services, which are reflected by a rise in medical costs in the fourth quarter that peaks in the first quarter of the following calendar year. There are two significant viruses that play an important role in this seasonal increase in respiratory illness. The first is influenza, something with which we all quite familiar now. The Center for Disease Control monitors flu activity in part through a network of healthcare providers who voluntarily report patient visits for flu-like illness. Flu-like illness is defined as a fever with temperatures greater than 100 degrees Fahrenheit and cough or sore throat in the absence of a known cause. Since reporting is not mandatory, as it is for illnesses such as hepatitis or tuberculosis, the quality of data is quite variable. Furthermore, having more providers participate could produce an artifact, making flu-like illnesses appear more prevalent when compared to past years. In other words more reports don’t always mean more flu. Also the CDC monitors hospitalization among children in 12 metropolitan areas around the country. Of these 12, Molina presently serves only one, Albuquerque, New Mexico. So as you can see, the CDC surveillance data is of limited use to us. At Molina we rely more on our own internal data sources as a predictor of increased flu-like activity. Another important cause of respiratory illness that exhibits a similar seasonal pattern is RSV. RSV causes respiratory illness in children. It’s quite common. Virtually all children in United States will have sustained an RSV infection at some time before the age of three. An annual RSV epidemic typically peaks in the first quarter and is responsible for one quarter to one-half of all pediatric hospitalizations for bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Neither influenza nor RSV responds well to antibiotics because they are self-limited viral infections. There is a vaccine for influenza, because the influenza virus mutates rapidly however, developing an effective vaccine is difficult. The vaccine was less effective this year. Synagis is a drug for RSV recommended for children who fall into certain high-risk groups such as premature infants and other at risk children. It confers some passive immunity. However, Synagis is expensive, and a single-shot does not confer lasting protection against RSV. The CDC provides surveillance information on the website for both influenza and RSV. These are at best only directional indicators of respiratory illness. They are limited, because of the voluntary and regional sources of the data. Health plans and the public health sector have launched vigorous education in immunization campaigns in recent years. The public seems more aware of and accepting of the need for vaccinations. For influenza, it is a single vaccination. RSV requires a series of injections. At Molina, we have mounted an aggressive outreach campaign to make sure that patients comply with all the injections. We will continue our programs for influenza and RSV in the future, even though we cannot predict their future success. In addition, it remains to be seen if the shift in our mix of patients with the greater inclusion of the elderly, blind, and disabled members will affect the seasonal variation in health care costs. With that review of our highlights for the past quarter, let me turn to our expectations for all of year 2008. In light of the many developments from the first quarter, we now feel we have additional information to be able to adjust our 2008 earnings outlook. Our new earnings per share guidance range is from $2.10 to $2.40 per share. John will discuss the guidance in greater detail during his remarks. Finally, our Board of Directors has authorized the company to repurchase up to $30 million of common stock. We believe a stock repurchase program is an attractive use of our cash and underscores our belief in the long-term value of our stock, as well as our commitment to deliver shareholder value. With lower interest rates and growing cash balances, executing this modest stock buyback will enable us to earn a respectable return and still leave us with sufficient cash to pursue growth opportunities. The repurchase program will be funded from working capital and will be based on market conditions and other factors. I will now turn the call over to John.
John C. Molina, J.D.: As Mario noted, 2008 first quarter results show a sound improvement over 2007 results with earnings of $0.46 per share representing year-over-year growth of 35%. First quarter net income was $13 million compared to 2007 first quarter net income of approximately $10 million. Our first quarter 2008 revenue increased 31% or $173 million compared to the first quarter of 2007. As outlined in our earnings release today, this increase includes the benefit of the Mercy CarePlus acquisition; higher enrollment in Ohio, New Mexico, Washington, and Texas; as well as higher premium rates in New Mexico, Washington, and Michigan. Our medical care ratio is essentially flat, going from 85.7% in the first quarter of 2007 to 85.8% in the first quarter of 2008. This is a slight increase of 10 basis points year-over-year despite a significant growth in our ABD population as Mario noted. The 85.8% medical care ratio represents 220 basis point change over the prior quarter ended December 31, 2007. This is not surprising, as the consolidated company has traditionally experienced its highest medical care ratio during the first quarter. In the earnings release, we have provided additional disclosure about the medical care costs of the CFC and ABD members in Ohio. We typically do not provide such discrete disclosure, but do so now because of its significance to our first quarter results. The medical care ratio for our CFC population decreased year-over-year from 92.4% to 88.9%. Decreased hospitalizations as measured by admissions per thousand members and decreases in pharmacy utilization were the main drivers of a lower MCR. A year-over-year comparison for the ABD population is not meaningful given the low ABD enrollment in the first quarter of 2007.  However, the medical care ratio for the ABD population decreased sequentially from 97% in the fourth quarter of 2007, to 92.7% in the first quarter of 2008. Sequential decreases in hospitalization, as measured by admissions per thousand, and decreases in pharmacy utilization reflect a cumulative effect of our case management strategies. Our guidance assumes an 88% combined medical care ratio for the entire year for the Ohio plan, and we are pleased with progress towards that goal. General and administrative expenses in the first quarter were 10.6% of total revenue or $78 million, as compared to 11.3% of total revenue or $63 million for the first quarter of 2007. Core G&A expenses, defined as G&A expenses less premium taxes, decreased to 7.8% of total revenue for the first quarter of 2008, as compared to 7.9% for the first quarter of 2007. This improvement in core G&A is primarily due to the leveraging of the company’s administrative infrastructure over increased enrollment in premium revenue. Income taxes increased in the first quarter of 2008. The effective tax rate increased to 40.7% in the quarter ended March 31, 2008, from 38% in March 31, 2007. This was primarily due to a change in the Michigan state tax calculation methodology effective January 1, 2008. Cash flow used in operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 was $23 million, compared to cash flow from operations totaling $35.9 million for the same period in 2007, a decrease of $59.3 million. This decline was primarily due to the timing of the receipt of deferred revenue at our Ohio health plan.  The state of Ohio has typically paid premiums to our Ohio health plan for any given month in the prior month. For the April month of enrollment, the state of Ohio did not pay premiums to the Ohio health plan in March but rather waited until April 3, 2008. This had the effect of altering cash flow for the first quarter of 2008. The April capitation for Ohio health plan is $50.9 million. Excluding the impact of this deferred revenue, cash provided by operating activities would have been $27.5 million or slightly more than 2x net income. At March 31, 2008, the company had cash and investments, not including restricted investments, of approximately $666 million. The parent company had cash and investments of approximately $84 million. The company remains consistent in its reserving methodology and claims inventories continue to decline. Year-over-year, our claims inventory has decreased by one-third. As a result of several recent developments, we believe we have sufficient additional information to adjust our 2008 earnings outlook. We are therefore revising our earnings per share guidance for the full year 2008 to a range of $2.10 per share to $2.40 per share. This adjusted guidance revises our original guidance of $2.25 to $2.45 per share as issued on January 22, 2008. We believe the following six factors have contributed most significantly to our guidance revision. First, the company expects that declining interest income will reduce its previously anticipated 2008 earnings per share by approximately $0.16. The revised guidance assumes that the Federal Reserve will implement two rate cuts of 0.25% each on April 30, 2008 and June 30, 2008.  The revised guidance assumes that the company’s return on invested cash for all of 2008 will be approximately 3.1% rather than the 4.0% included in the original 2008 guidance. To remind you, a 0.25% change in interest equates to a $1.8 million annualized change in pre-tax earnings. Second, we expect the California health plan’s premium rates to be reduced on July 1. We expect that the California health plan will experience a revenue reduction of approximately 5% to 6% for the second half of the year, some of which can be offset by cost reductions. We believe the net effect will reduce earnings per share by approximately $0.10. Third, the company expects higher than anticipated state taxes in Michigan will reduce its previously anticipated 2008 earnings per share by approximately $0.08. Fourth, enrollment in the CFC or TANF segment of our Ohio health plan will increase above previously anticipated guidance. We believe that this will add approximately $0.10 per share based predominantly on leverage of administrative costs over a larger enrollment base. Fifth, the company expects the purchase of shares will decrease our share count, resulting in an increase in 2008 earnings per share of $0.02 to $0.04. Finally, continuing improvements in our operations will increase 2008 earnings per share by approximately $0.11. The revised guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 40.6%, and weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 28.7 million, excluding the effect of any share repurchases. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are ready to take questions.  
Operator:  Your first question comes from Bill Georges – JP Morgan. 
Bill Georges – JP Morgan:  Could you start off by addressing a little bit in more detail both your lower SG&A in the quarter, which is I think the lowest really in recent memory, as well as maybe a little more detail around the $0.11 catchall positive impact that you referred to in the revised guidance.
John C. Molina, J.D.:  Bill, we’ve talked a lot about controlling administrative costs, starting about the fourth quarter of last year, we really clamped down on hiring and other admin expenditures. Given the sequential growth in enrollment, we have been able to leverage that over a larger enrollment base and larger premiums. That’s basically, why admin came down. As far as the $0.11 improvement of other operations, there are a lot of moving pieces; we see some improvement in Michigan for example, some improvement in New Mexico. We’re going to see a little bit I think of a decline in expectations as far as Missouri went. So you’re seeing different pieces moving up and back and so we put it all into one line.
Joseph White:  We’re seeing some administrative cost improvement overall which is part of that.
Bill Georges – JP Morgan:  In terms of thinking about the lower G&A, is that a fair run rate for the balance of the year?
J. Mario Molina, M.D.: I would say yes.
Joseph White:  Yes, I think we can see it, maybe bounce around a little bit, but that’s a pretty good run rate.
Bill Georges – JP Morgan:  About your Ohio MLR, but 200 basis points improvement still needed for the balance of the year, and you are taking on arguably a challenging population with the addition of the former WellPoint members. So can you talk a little bit about where you derive the confidence from to get that improvement when you also layer in the additional thirty some thousand members from WellPoint?
Joseph White:  Bill, we have been able to make fairly steady progress throughout 2007 into the first quarter of 2008 to bring our costs down. So that gives us some degree of confidence that what we’ve been doing has been showing some results. We were able to renegotiate a number of key provider contracts and those new rates didn’t kick in until either late fourth quarter or early first quarter.  We don’t know how challenging or not challenging the WellPoint population is. They had trouble with it, but we’re going to manage it as we’ve managed the rest of the CFC population in the Central region.
John C. Molina, J.D.:  The additional membership in the Central region is helpful, because it helps us with our administrative costs in Ohio. The new patients that are coming over will be using our provider contracts, not WellPoint’s contracts. We think that there’s some benefit to that. And just in looking at hospital utilization and preliminary pharmacy costs, we are not seeing that this population is behaving significantly differently than our current CFC members. So given our systems, our contracts, and our experience, we think that this is going to be beneficial.
Bill Georges – JP Morgan:  You did mention on new contracts with pharmacy in Ohio, anything going on there?
John C. Molina, J.D.:  No the new contracts with some hospital systems not with the pharmacy, but we had, Dr. Siegel might be able to comment on this, were some changes in how we case manage some of the ABD population for our pharmacy.
Michael Siegel:  Yes, we have a fairly intensive case management program and we’re integrating more of our pharmacy information in terms of case finding and management of these cases.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse. 
Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse:  You provide the walk through, but when I make those adjustments to the previous guidance, I get to a different range. I get a range of $2.14 to $2.36. Well you came short of my estimate anyway for the quarter by $0.04, so that explains the low end of the guidance, but that actually brings the high-end of the guidance down even further from the $2.40, so I’m just trying to figure out what is the delta when I add back all those components to the $2.10 to $2.40?
John C. Molina, J.D.:  Honestly Greg there is a bit of a fudge factor in there. We’re not sure for example if there’s interest rates declines in both quarters, we assume that there is. There may or may not be also the underlying performance of other plans, the $0.11 we put in there. It could be a couple of cents higher or lower. So it’s not strictly the mathematical sum of, there are various ups and downs. We give ourselves a little bit of a buffer, both high and low.
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  The other thing the way I look at it Greg, as I started up by looking at our midpoint of the range at $2.35 and then I made the adjustments that we walk through based on that, and that’s the way I look at it.
Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse:  Mario, you provide a lot of detailed commentary on the flu which is very helpful, but could you just give us a ballpark quantification of what you estimate the respiratory illness costs related to the flu and the RSV were in the quarter?
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  Well we don’t normally break it out that way Greg. What we saw was in some states we saw higher utilization than expected. California for example and Missouri, but other states we actually saw little utilization, so I think it’s one of the things I was trying to emphasize. This can be quite regional, and if you’re going in a state where there is heavy epidemic, it can have a big impact on you.  Our operations stretch across the country, but in particular regions, in particular states. So that’s why it’s difficult to extrapolate a lot of this data. If you’re looking at the flu rates in Connecticut and we are not in the Northeast, it’s not really relevant.
Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse:  You had $6.8 million favorable New Mexico rebate revenue benefit and I was just trying to get to a run rate first quarter number. My understanding is that you don’t expect another one of those going forward, so that maybe was a one-time benefit to the quarter, but then maybe a little bit offset by the higher flu costs, which presumably you don’t anticipate going forward, so how would I net those two against one another?
Joseph White:  First of all we entered the year with about, I want to say $12.8 million payable to the state of New Mexico under medical costs, but that’s now dropped to $6 million. So you’re correct about half of that is exhausted. But, there is still some room there. As far as New Mexico, I think they are predominantly dealing with issues of premature births and I think pharmacy costs.
Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse:  But would you say that $6.8 million was more than offset by the flu related costs in the quarter?
John C. Molina, J.D.:  It’s really hard to single that out Greg. Again we saw some, as Mario said, some increase in cost in California that’s certainly evident from the earnings release. But in places like Missouri where we heard anecdotally that January was a very tough month in terms of the ER visits. We really have no comparable previous year that we could rely on for a benchmark.  I’m also not convinced that what happened in Q1 is necessarily a one-time. We saw the second quarter in New Mexico where we don’t know what the medical costs are going to be that liability could go up or down. So it’s hard to isolate that as a one-time event.
Joseph White:  Suffice to say our guidance is not predicated on a MCR in New Mexico as low as it was this quarter.
Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse:  The California rate cut, the guidance do you’ve provided the 10%, to get to that is that implying you can pass through around 60% of the 5% to 6% rate cut to you. Is that about right?
John C. Molina, J.D.:  We are looking at a combination of administrative cuts in California, cuts based on changes in the fee schedule, some renegotiation with providers, and other measures that we hope to offset the decrease in revenue.
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  Remember too that this is a 10% cut in the provider fee schedule. Some of our providers are capitated and some of them are fee-for-service, and it largely exempts hospital inpatients. And that’s why, when you see this and you hear the 10% rate cut, we don’t see it as translating into a 10% revenue cut for us. So we think it’s going to be somewhere between 5% and 6% top line and that will be mitigated somewhat by re-contracting efforts and passing along some of the cuts to providers whose contracts are based on a fee-for-service Medicaid fee schedule.
Greg Nersessian - Credit Suisse:  The buyback, would those be open market purchases or there will be some family stock that you’d be selling?
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  That’s going to be open market repurchases.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank. 
Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank:  First question just around California and if you can provide an update on how the re-contracting efforts are going so far and the receptivity level of providers to that? And then just relative to the California MLR in the first quarter, maybe just talk about the increase there year-over-year. How much of that is you saw as seasonal, and maybe just in the context of the moving pieces in California your view around what you view as a full year California MLR run rate for the year?
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  Well as you can imagine, Scott none of the providers were happy about the rate cut whether it’s coming from us or directly from the state. It’s going to be a big problem for all the physicians in California. I think that we can deal with it. We also have excess capacity in our clinics to absorb some patients if providers terminate their contracts. But I frankly don’t see that happening. In terms of costs in California, they were up largely because of inpatient costs and some higher pharmacy costs. Some of that was due to changes we made in the formulary to be more competitive, and I think that’s helped in terms of enrollment. On the other hand I think that if you look at states that are predominantly TANF, and California and Missouri certainly fit that pattern. They’re probably going to be, I believe more affected by the seasonal variation in these respiratory illnesses, especially RSV.
Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank:  And then for the full year, do you think the 88% is that a good range going into the back half of the year with already incorporating at a bit of higher look, or any range you can give us around the California MLR?
Joseph White:  I don’t want to give it a specific number, but we expect that MCR to be dropping in the half second quarter, and then probably a little upward tick in it as a result of the rate situation in the second half of the year. So we expect that overall to be coming down.
Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank:  On Texas, actually that looks like you had a big improvement year-over-year, I think around 1,600 basis point. And maybe if you can talk about the drivers, I think you cited the STAR+PLUS in the press release as being favorable there and whether you had any one-time reserved development there or whether you think that’s a good run rate for the rest of the year in Texas?
John C. Molina, J.D.:  I think that’s a probably a bit low in Texas for the whole year. I think we had an original guidance expected of 85%, so we’re still experiencing some favorable medical costs in Texas. We have reserved some for the experience rebates, similar to other plans in the state.
Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank:  Where do you think that you stand with any upcoming state budget discussions in any of your markets and obviously moving pieces right now with Florida being in flux a bit and just whether there is any discussion that you can maybe spike out in some of your markets that we should be thinking about?
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  No, we typically pass on that information as it develops. I don’t really have anything new to report at this time.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Darren Miller - Goldman Sachs. 
Darren Miller - Goldman Sachs:  On the California provider cut, what is the EPS impact you’re assuming from the renegotiation efforts?
John C. Molina, J.D.:  We’re expecting net, a $0.10 EPS hit.
Darren Miller - Goldman Sachs:  And what is the benefit from the renegotiation and is it bringing that down like $0.12 or $0.15?
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  No, the net effect is $0.10.
Darren Miller - Goldman Sachs:  What the benefit is of renegotiating, if I think that in terms of that’s something that’s ongoing, that could or could not happen?
Joseph White:  We’ve spoken about roughly an $11 million premium cut. We think we can offset about 40% of that cut with medical savings and another 20% with admin cuts. So that’s how you work down to a net $0.10 impact on a $11 million revenue cut in the second half of the year. Does that help?
Darren Miller - Goldman Sachs:  So the renegotiation would be 40% of the $11?
Joseph White:  Medical cuts overall would be some of that renegotiation, it’s a variety of efforts, but some of it’s a pass through on the change of the Medi-Cal fee schedules and that kind of thing, so it’s not all renegotiation.
Darren Miller - Goldman Sachs:  I am trying to spike out the difference between what’s pass through and what’s renegotiation?
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  Well, probably a third of our costs right now are fee-for-service tied to Medicaid fee schedule on the physician side I think so, and that will probably just be a pass through.
Darren Miller - Goldman Sachs:  So two-thirds of the 40% is renegotiation?
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  Roughly.
Darren Miller - Goldman Sachs:  On Ohio, will you talk a little bit about your MCR expectations for the 35,000 lives that you’re picking up?
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  I think we believe there are going to be consistent with the current CFC membership, and we think there will be some additional benefit in terms of decreasing administrative costs on a percentage basis because we will be spreading more membership across that administrative infrastructure.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Carl McDonald - Oppenheimer & Company. 
Carl McDonald - Oppenheimer & Company:  On the Ohio membership, if I take the 35,000 lives to get the $0.10, you have assumed a margin somewhere in the vicinity of 7%. And it looks like the assumption is the CFC business will run in a range of 2% to 4% this year. So could you just walk through, when you take on a block of business like that 35,000 lives, how much do you have to add in terms of new people to process claims, answer the phones, versus just the fixed, the cost leverage you get from all of the fixed costs that you have?
John C. Molina, J.D.:  It’s actually fairly minimal, Carl, in terms of the incremental people you’ve got to add for claims and phones, etc. That’s why we think that it will add $0.10 because the incremental marginal revenue on those patients is going to be much greater than the marginal costs. So you could just assume that from the CFC patients, which we’re expecting to be around 86% I believe in terms of the MCR the incremental admin is not anywhere close to the average admin.
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  We have been working on the issues around answering phone calls and what are the top reasons members call us and how we are handling those.
Terry Bayer, MPH, JD:  Instead of looking at the Ohio situation as static, and then just incremental benefit of the new enrollment, you have to really look at it as the ongoing improvement we are putting in place in all of our health plans, and specifically in Ohio. So as we are growing in size and greater experience in these states, we are taking on a number of projects, which allow us to move to more self-service modalities. I’ll give you an example, we’ve recently rolled out an Interactive Voice Response, IVR system, where a member calling in for an ID card, and our members frequently misplace or lose their ID cards, are able to simply hit a button on the phone and have a card automatically mailed out to them. We don’t have to take that phone call anymore, although our reps stand ready for those members who chose to go to the live operator.  The same thing applies for our provider information on eligibility and claims status. So we are constantly reducing what we call controllable admin across the company, and the additional membership just gives us a greater opportunity to leverage the improvements we’re making.
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  And what we’ve been doing with this Carl is when members are calling in now for these services, we are walking them through it and teaching them how to use the IVR, so the next time they call they don’t have to go to an operator, but they can go directly to the IVR and get some of the things that they need. Because the most common things that we’re getting calls on, one of the most common one is, maybe the most common one is new ID card and that can be handled pretty simply. So with those things we are becoming more efficient over time.
Terry Bayer, MPH, JD:  A lot of our calls come from providers. So a provider now has more members assigned. Same provider that’s used to using our system, although there is not one-on-one match, many of the providers overlap. So the provider that called in to us for eligibility on the automated system now is calling in for the new members. That didn’t generate any additional work.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Tom Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus. 
Tom Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus:  I’ve heard your discussion on the Ohio market, in terms of the $0.10 impacting your revised guidance, and you have the other category, which adds-back the $0.11 in terms of other items. Could you maybe just give us a little more color on what those items are that are going to potentially add $0.11 a share. In New Mexico the $6.8 million, is that all revenue with no associated expense to it, maybe just touch on that and clarify it for me. I realize it was just last week that this happened, but have you had a chance to maybe look at your Tennessee bid and think about the scores that you got back and perhaps what you did right, what you did wrong, maybe a short discussion on that. 
John C. Molina, J.D.:  Tom, in terms of New Mexico we have not gotten any additional information rather than the score.
Tom Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus:  I mean Tennessee, you said New Mexico.
John C. Molina, J.D.:  We need to get the responses and take a look at it. It was a little unusual because we partnered with an independent company, something we don’t typically do. So we’ll learn from that.
Joseph White:  I think the way to look at New Mexico is to remember that we’re committed to a minimum medical expenditure of 80% of MCR currently. And to the extent we built up a reserve by the end of last year of around $12.8 million that in effect it accretes back to revenue in order to reduce our MCR during the quarter to 80%.  So I think the way, if you want to look at it is, if you wanted to isolate that the single quarter, yes, you could say that 6.8% of the revenue is essentially a re-adoption of an amount we had booked back to the state as of 12/31/07. There is still another $6 million of that available.
Tom Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus:  And then on the $0.11 maybe couple of comments for us?
Joseph White:  I think John touched on it. I would just say in general we are looking at better performance in Michigan than we anticipated, better performance in New Mexico than we anticipated, Missouri not quite so well as we anticipated, that’s the big one on the health plan side.  And then overall from an admin perspective, particularly at the parent, we’re expecting favorable results versus the guidance we put out back in January. John touched on how we’ve been planting down our administrative costs, growth in that area has been much less than we anticipated.
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  In Tennessee we did not qualify in the Eastern region, but we did qualify in the Western region and did participate in the oral presentations. We were disappointed that we didn’t do better. I think that we were probably the most experienced health plan applying in Tennessee for that contract. So it was a little bit of a surprise to us that we didn’t do better in that procurement.
Tom Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus:  How much oversight to the bid process did you have specifically or was it more on the UAHC side of things?
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  Yes, it was a joint bid. We did participate in the writing of that and we did participate in the oral presentations, and we felt that the WMIP program was a great model, very similar to what they wanted to do in Tennessee, and it’s been independently evaluated and rated as one of the best programs going for an integrated health care model, which is why we were a little surprised that we didn’t fare better in that procurement.
Operator:  Your next question comes from John Rex - Bear Stearns. 
John Rex - Bear Stearns:  Could you focus on the Washington market just for a moment here? At the sequential move in MCR in particular here, so I would have anticipated given the way the fee schedule increase occurred late last year, and your higher premiums didn’t kick in into the 1Q. I wouldn’t have expected this sequential move in the MCR, would have expected 4Q to actually be the worst, which is actually the best for the year and then the ramp up in the 1Q. Can you tell us what was going on in that market particular? And then again focusing on the sequential?
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  Yes, Washington is another one of our states that is predominantly TANF. So it’s not surprising that it bounces around a bit. We did see some increases especially in January in I believe it was pharmacy and inpatient utilization that started to come back down in March, so it’s not surprising that the costs were higher in the first quarter.
John Rex - Bear Stearns:  I am trying to size impact from flu. Is that a market that we could say then, without flu having been higher, the seasonal impact, you should have had, given the rate increase that you got layered on in January; you should have been sequentially improved in loss ratio from 4Q to 1Q?
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  It’s hard to know John, and the problem that we have to a certain extent is by providing a lot more information on a market-by-market basis, that people are spending a lot of time trying to dissect the individual markets. Things move up and things move down and this is a little bit like making sausage. With most health plans, all you see is the final product.  With Molina you get to see the whole thing from beginning to end. It’s a little messy at times, but I think that the end product, which was the consolidated EPS, was about where we had hoped to be. So, you got to remember, you may not see this without health plans but there are fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter in the different markets. And that’s part of our strategy in geographic diversification so that we balance this out a little bit and aren’t so susceptible to individual market fluctuations.  And for example, although we had a very heavy inpatient month in terms of hospital costs in January, the overall compared to the previous year, hospitalizations at least in the TANF category were down. So, it’s a whole mix of things and in the end it’s the final product that is most important.
John Rex - Bear Stearns:  On Michigan, the highlight on the taxes there and then your comment on the potential to mitigate that, when you say that you mean you may be able to do something about the higher tax rate or that you offset it with savings, other administrative savings in Michigan?
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  The tax has changed in Michigan and it’s our understanding that it was not meant to affect the Medicaid plans. So, there may be a mitigation of that, but for the time being we are going with the higher tax rate.
John C. Molina, J.D.:  But John, the improvement in Michigan that we talked about is really underlying performance of the health plan pre-tax, so lower medical costs.
John Rex - Bear Stearns:  So, on that $0.08 is there something going on that could get revised in terms of the higher tax rate that was not supposed to impact Medicaid plans.
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  The short answer is yes.
John Rex - Bear Stearns:  You’re just not counting on it at this point of course, but.
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  We are not counting on it but it could happen.
John Rex - Bear Stearns:  And then can you update me on what your full year cash flow guidance would be now?
John C. Molina, J.D.:  Our pet answer is depreciation plus amortization plus net income. Although we caveat that with cash flow generally is higher when we’re growing and we’ve grown sequentially. And then we’re going to grow more, looks like in Ohio. So, could be a bit higher than net income plus depreciation and amortization.
John Rex - Bear Stearns:  It could be reasonably higher; it could still be in 1.5 plus in terms of a net income metric. Is that out of the range?
John C. Molina, J.D.:  I think that’s reasonable.
John Rex - Bear Stearns:  And then can you comment on just what progression you’re thinking about in terms EPS for the year? Given all the moving parts we have in there and thinking about California when that kicks in.
John C. Molina, J.D.:  I think which we are going to see is probably a dip in the, little bit of a slowdown in the back half of the year because you’ve got the California issue which is really a second path event.
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  Yes, but remember given that we’re projecting somewhere in the neighborhood of $2.9 billion in revenue and we are looking at what, California shortfall revenue being $11 million? It’s not going to have a big impact on overall revenue. We are seeing improvements in the medical costs in multiple markets. So, we are still projecting that we could get to double-digit EPS growth for the year.
John C. Molina, J.D.:  And we’re not expecting really much of a seasonal change in terms of the medical costs, after the California change.
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  Things should improve from here first quarter is typically the highest cost quarter.
John Rex - Bear Stearns:  With California kicking in, would you still expect maybe even balancing first half, second half earnings contribution here? How would you expect it to roughly play out in percentage terms?
John C. Molina, J.D.:  I think didn’t we give something, some guidance on that in January about how the quarters typically breakdown?
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  Yes we did.
John Rex - Bear Stearns:  Yes, and I didn’t know how that had changed given the update on earnings.
J. Mario Molina, M.D.: I really don’t think it’s going to change dramatically because, as John said while we’ve got the downside in California second half of the year, we got the Ohio membership coming on now. I don’t think it’s going to change materially.
John Rex - Bear Stearns:  Joe, when you talked about New Mexico you said it was 80%, hadn’t that been 85% prior, did that get updated?
Joseph White:  It’s been 80% since July of 2007.
Operator:  And our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin - Lehman Brothers. 
Josh Raskin - Lehman Brothers:  We can just start with the second quarter earnings. To John’s point, there’s a lot of moving parts here whether it’s the interest rates are kicking in in April, or the California cuts that don’t come to later in the year. So, will you expect a decent ramp up in the second quarter earnings because as Mario mentioned the costs are typically higher, or should we think about there being mitigating factors given in the second quarter, like New Mexico?
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  Typically utilization is lower in the second quarter, so we expect medical costs to come down. The California issue doesn’t kick in until third quarter, because that’s a July 1 event. I don’t know what else to add.
Josh Raskin - Lehman Brothers:  If I think about last year, the second quarter was 35% to 40% higher on a sequential basis. Obviously it’s off of bigger numbers this year, so maybe how should we think about that sequential increase. Would you say it was abnormally stronger last year or should we think about similar types of ramp up?
John C. Molina, J.D.:  I think it was abnormal last year. I think there might have been in second quarter some retroactive rate increases in California. Typically what we see is the highest medical costs in January. They lower in the first quarter; they lower in second quarter, hit bottom in the third quarter, go up in the fourth quarter. And we are not expecting that to change much, in terms of the progression. What is changing are some rate increases. If we get anything in Missouri, it will be July. If we get something in Michigan, it will be October.
Joseph White:  The Missouri expansions are a bit of an unknown and when and if it’s going to happen.
Josh Raskin - Lehman Brothers:  In terms of California broadly speaking as you think about additional rate cut here, it’s not as though California has been particularly helpful with rates over the last several years. I’m just thinking, what is this strategic thought process around the state and understanding that your MLR is still indicative of profit in the state which is sort of how do you think about it longer term?
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  I think that we can be profitable in California. California follows Sutton’s law. The reason to be in California is because it’s the largest Medicaid market in the country. It’s also the largest Medicare market and largest Medicare SNP market. So there are lot of good reasons to be in California, although it is a very difficult and very competitive market.  At the same time, what you’re seeing as we get into other states, and we see the growth in health plans like Ohio, is that the contribution to the California makes is smaller and smaller. And that goes along with our strategy to diversify geographically, and also to diversify by product. We are trying to get more of the ABD membership. We are trying to grow our SNP membership.  And as I mentioned in the call, our SNP contract, our Medicare contract, is now contributing 3% of overall revenue. A year ago at this time it was 1.6%, and before that it was essentially zero. And we have seen although not spectacular growth, steady growth in our Medicare product which we expect to continue.
Josh Raskin - Lehman Brothers:  On the Texas profit sharing, I think I understand how that works in term of giving back based on a minimum MLR, when you book that back, does that come from an accounting standpoint maybe Joe, how does that exactly flows to the income statement? Is that just a revenue reduction or additional medical cost or SG&A, how does that go?
Joseph White:  It’s analogous to what we do in New Mexico in terms of it’s an adjustment to revenue either positive or negative. The difference in Texas so that’s actually on a pre-tax profit basis not an MCR.
Josh Raskin - Lehman Brothers:  But you just simply adjust the revenues to get you to a pre-tax margin.
Joseph White:  That’s correct.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Matt Perry - Wachovia. 
Matt Perry - Wachovia:  In reference to your prior full year revenue and medical loss ratio guidance again, given the moving parts here in the new guidance have those changed? 
Joseph White:  As revenue, not dramatically other than for adjusting for the new Ohio membership, and then in MCR too are up slightly from an MCR perspective. Again which is consistent with the addition of Ohio membership, where we run a little bit higher MCR.
Matt Perry - Wachovia:  Mario, I am curious maybe to get your perspective, given the fact that the company has been operating in California for quite some time. If we’re entering a recession, looking back at history, what things happen in terms of enrollment, funding of Medicaid, potential enrollment declines or increases, and is there any broader implications you can draw from your experience in maybe past tough times economically and apply it to other markets?
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  Well, we have been doing business in the Medicaid space in California since 1980, and we have seen the Medicaid business called Medi-Cal here cycle and it does cycle. And we are in one of those downturns right now. If you go back to what our father used to say, when you are faced with a storm, you pull in the oars and you lay down in the bottom of the boat and you wait for it to pass.  Because this is a company whose mission is to serve low-income patients, who receive their care through government programs, we’re going to stay in the market. And we are going to hunker down, wait for the storm to pass, and I think we’ll come out even stronger on the other side. That’s typically what’s happened and that explains a lot of growth that we have had in our company in California, by being able to weather these storms.
Matt Perry - Wachovia:  If you can take that one-step further, do these tough times maybe spur states to think about using managed care and cost saving initiatives to an even greater degree?
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  Absolutely, a great example of that is the legislative analyst office puts out a report on the budget and they specifically remarked in this year’s report, California should be doing a better job of using managed care and should be shifting their aged, blind, and disabled into managed care.  There are five county organized health systems in California where all the Medicaid beneficiaries are enrolled, and these health plans have all the TANF and all the ABDs. So, we have a tested model in California that has been proven to be successful both in managing the cost and providing the quality care and access. In the two plan model counties and in the GMC counties, that hasn’t been done yet. But for both I think quality reasons because I do think managed care provides higher quality then fee-for-service, and for cost saving reasons, I think state needs to look seriously at that. In addition, if you look at states like Texas, New Mexico, Michigan, Ohio, they have all moved to this and done it successfully. So, there’s also a good deal of precedent not only in California with the county organized health systems, but in other states. I think that this is going to be an issue that’s not going to go away and that states are going to have to make a broader use of managed care in the future, not only to control cost but to improve access and quality.
Matt Perry - Wachovia:  And just one last from me, any emerging or new RFPs or opportunities you’re looking at?
John C. Molina, J.D.:  Well, we are always looking at new opportunities.
Operator:  Your last question comes from the line of David [inaudible]. 
David [inaudible]:  So, just to be clear on the Fed cut if the Fed chooses to keep rates steady either at tomorrow or the next meeting. Your guidance would go up accordingly, is that correct?
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  Well, it’s just what I was saying that we had given you the sensitivity analysis, how to correct the earnings numbers for changes in interest income. We have provided a range. So, there may be some movement but I think that right now even with that, if that would it comes to pass it would be minor change overall and we would not reissue guidance. That’s why we have given ourselves a range.
David [inaudible]: But intellectually it would be the lower end and the higher end of the range would go up by the $0.08 or whatever the math works out to be but, what you are saying is no, you are not going to adjust a little bit.
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  The way I look at it is looking at it is that I think that the actual number lies somewhere within that range, and if the interest rates were not to go down, then we would expect our earnings expectation to rise within that range.
David [inaudible]: Separately, if I take to $1.8 million per quarter point annualize change and I do a quarter point cut in April and a quarter point cut in June, and divide it by your share account tax adjusted. I get an $0.08 change. Is there any other math that goes into that or is there another impact on any auction rate securities or anything else that’s going into the Fed commentary?
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  No. The difference is the rate cuts that the Fed has already put in place.
David [inaudible]: So that’s just annualizing those?
J. Mario Molina, M.D.: Correct.
David [inaudible]: The change in your guidance, you do a great job in categorizing all the changes, but the one part that I don’t know if you commented on is that the range has gotten wider. Is there a reason for that, are things less predictable going forward or what was the decision or the thought process behind that?
J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  Yes. That was deliberate on our part. There is probably a little bit greater degree of uncertainty and I think that one of the issues is the Michigan tax rate. Also, there are some other things that are moving around and at this point we brought the lower end of guidance down. We brought the top end of guidance down, but not as much. We still see a lot of upside potential this year and the wider range really reflects the degree of uncertainty. 
John C. Molina, J.D.:  We don’t want to get into the habit of changing guidance a penny here, a penny there every quarter. So, given the uncertainty as Mario said with Michigan, there is going to be a lot of turmoil in California. With lot of the providers upset and threatening to file suit to block these rate changes, we want to leave ourselves enough room within the guidance range that we are not going to come back every quarter and fine tune it.
David [inaudible]: On the Ohio premiums that got in after the close of the quarter, what was that payment? Does that make up for the swing in the operating cash generation?
John C. Molina, J.D.:  I believe it was $50.9 million and that’s the amount that we normally would have paid at the end of March for April month of service and instead it came in at the beginning of April, so it was just normalized, we would had $27 million in cash flow.
Operator:  Dr. Molina that ends the question-and-answer session. 
 J. Mario Molina, M.D.:  I want to thank everyone for joining us. I want to remind you that we have our Investor Day coming up in New York at the end of May. I believe it is May 29, so we hope to see you in New York. Thank you.

Joseph M. Molina - President and Chief Executive Officer:  Thank you Juan Jose and hello everyone. I hope you got the chance to read our press release which is comprehensive. As indicated by our results announced today, our fourth quarter performance represented a strong conclusion to the year. We accomplished a great deal in 2007 and our efforts translated in the consolidated full year earnings of $58 million or $2.05 per share. This figure represents a year-over-year increase in net earnings of 28%. Our results came in slightly ahead of our estimates and validated many of the assumptions we discussed at each of our investor days. As outlined in our press release, there were various factors contributing to our success in both the fourth quarter and full year. Generating these financial results are various operational achievements that are worth highlighting. These operational achievements can be grouped into three categories: Execution, Continuity, and Transparency. Let me briefly address each of these categories. Let's begin with Execution. In large part, our increased earnings can be attributed to higher revenues by holding the line on our medical care ratio. In our industry, managing medical care costs is a health plan's most fundamental form of blocking and tackling. In 2007, we continued to focus on basic medical management tactics that include re-contracting with providers, directing patients to cost-effective providers, implementation of care management programs, and the integration of new populations into our existing operations. The continued emphasis on basic management tactics is how we will succeed in 2008 and for the foreseeable future. The second category is Continuity. Essential to our success is a coherent and consistent approach in the execution of our business strategy. We have achieved our objectives as a result of our focus and the stability of our management team. If you have been following our company over the past few years, you will note that our executive team is stable and that we foster management continuity. Fox example, Jesse Thomas, who led our Ohio Health Plan, now leads our Michigan Health Plan. And Kathie Mancini, who is our COO in Ohio, was promoted to lead the Ohio Health Plan. This continuity strengthens our operations as our executive teams develop their skills by leading projects at Molina Healthcare from inception to completion. In addition, we benefit from executive teams that have managed to do challenging industry business cycles. Management continuity is at the core of the consistent execution of our strategy and is a characteristic that differentiates us in our industry. The final achievement in 2007 I would like to discuss is Transparency. Last year, we provided additional, financial and operational disclosure. Revenue and medical costs on a per member per month basis. Details on the category of services provided, and medical claims inventories include some of the information we added throughout the year. These disclosures help describe some of the details that we use to analyze and manage our business. We are very pleased with the progress we have made in building a more robust internal reporting and analysis infrastructure because it enhances our ability to identify and address business trends earlier. In 2008, we see opportunities across several of our markets despite potential challenges. One example of both a challenge and an opportunity is the recent rejection of the sweeping California Health Care Reform Bill. The failed passage of the bill hinders the expansion of coverage to 3.6 million Californians, but it heightens the need for the governor and the legislature to address incremental change to improve affordability and access to healthcare. This situation positions experienced Medicaid Managed Care Organizations, like Molina Healthcare, as logical partners for reducing healthcare cost and increasing access to healthcare. Our experience gives us confidence with respect to the current anxiety about the health of our economy. In previous recessionary periods, the governments turn to managed care for cost containment and increased access. Over our 27-year history, we have endured three economic downturns; one in the early 1980's, one in the early 1990’s, and the recession of 2001-2002. During tough economic times, the reimbursement rate environment sometimes becomes constrained and rate increases can be somewhat anemic. However, this is partially offset by higher enrollment as the Medicaid roles grow. Another characteristic of recessionary periods is the exit from the market by companies that are unable to make the economies work under a difficult reimbursement environment. The exit of such competitors provides membership growth opportunities for us. For example, our California plan has already benefited from the exit of local competitors in San Diego and Sacramento counties and we expect some membership increase from the exit of another local competitor in the central region in Ohio. Therefore, given our experience, our administrative efficiency and our focus on government programs, we view a recessionary period as a time of opportunity. We will continue to pursue our growth and diversification strategy. We will build on our Medicare experience, pursue acquisitions and participate in future RFPs in new and existing markets. As it relates to new markets, we expect to work with United American Healthcare (OTCPK:UAHC) to submit a bid for the Tennessee Western Region RFP. UAHC is a full-service healthcare company that owns and operates the health plan in Western Tennessee, and has a long history of participation in the Ten Care Program. If our bid is successful in the western region, Molina Healthcare will take a minority interest position in UAHC’s Health Plan. As you know from following our company, delivering quality healthcare is a priority at Molina Healthcare. We are, therefore, very proud that recently our Washington and Utah Health Plans have renewed their excellent accreditation status for 3 years. This means that both of these health plans, once again, met the criteria for Medicaid Managed Care Organizations established by the National Committee for Quality Assurance. Overall, I am pleased with our results in the progress we made in 2007. I want to take a moment to acknowledge all the hard work by our employees and the support shown by our state partners and by our providers during the past year. Finally, I want to thank those of you on the call for you interest and your investment in Molina Healthcare. I would now like to turn the call over to John.
John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Mario. As Mario noted, results for the fourth quarter of 2007 and fiscal year 2007 showed an improvement over 2006 results. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.63 per share as compared to $0.41 per share for the fourth quarter in December 31, 2006. Additionally at year end, earnings were $2.05 per share as compared to $1.62 per share for 2006, a significant increase of 27%. These results are slightly better than our stated expectations of $1.90 to $2. Our results tracked very closely with the estimates and the assumptions we provided back on September 12. We were on target with our revenue estimate. We did better than anticipated on our medical care ratio, and initiative costs were slightly higher due in part to Medicare. Our 2007 fourth quarter revenue includes the benefit of higher enrollment at our New Mexico, Ohio, and Texas Health Plans and the acquisition of Mercy Care Plus in Missouri. These increases offset the termination of operations in Indiana and reduced membership in Utah and Michigan. Our medical care ratio decreased from 85.1% in the fourth quarter of 2006 to 83.6% in the fourth quarter of 2007. This is an improvement of 150 basis points year-over-year, and 10 basis point improvement over the prior quarter in September 30, 2007. This improvement comes from stable utilization, lower medical care ratios in the Ohio and Texas health plans, and the termination of operations in Indiana. General and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were 11.8% of total revenue or $81 million as compared to 11.1% of total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2006 or $61 million. Core G&A expenses defined as G&A expenses less premium taxes increased to 8.8% of total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2007 as compared to 7.9% for the fourth quarter of 2006. This increase in Core G&A is primarily due to increases in employee incentive compensation, which will be expected given the company’s improved financial performance, employee recruiting costs, and continued investments to support our Medicare operations. These Medicare investments include: development costs, the service area expansion into two new markets, the addition of the MAPD product to all of our Medicare markets, sales and marketing, information technology, and salaries with our new management team in our Medicare operation. For 2007, premium revenues were $2.5 billion, an increase of $477 million or about 25% of our premium revenue of $2 billion in 2006. Medicare premium revenue increased 81% to $49 million in 2007 as compared to $27 million in 2006. Nearly all of our health plans contributed to both higher premiums and enrollment gains. The increase in premium revenue was mainly due to membership growth in New Mexico, Ohio, and Texas, a full year of CAPE Health Plan in Michigan, the finalization of Mercy Care Plus acquisition along with premium increases in California, Washington, and New Mexico. As it relates to enrollment gains, before taking into consideration our exit from the Indiana market or the Missouri acquisition, membership increased approximately 6% year over year. We also experienced some modest growth in our Medicare population where the premiums are higher as compared to Medicaid. Our consolidated medical care ratio was essentially flat year over year despite the addition of the aged, blind, and disabled population in Ohio. A comprehensive list of medical care cost drivers is available in our press release, but I want to take a moment to highlight a few of these items. In California, our medical care ratio decreased from 88.3% in 2006 to 82% in 2007 as a result of premium increases in San Bernardino, Riverside, San Diego, and Sacramento counties. Medical costs in California on a per-member per month basis remained essentially flat due to stable utilization and provider re-contracting. Our health plan in Ohio continues to experience some reductions in the medical care ratio, specifically the covered families and children or CFC populations medical care ratio decreased from 88.6% in the fourth quarter of 2006 to 86.2% in the fourth quarter of 2007. This was offset by the addition of the aged, blind, and disabled population in 2007 where the medical care ratio was 94.7% for all of 2007. As outlined in our press release, we expect the Ohio aged, blind and disabled membership to have a reduced medical care ratio for 2008 with a 2.6% rate increase effective January 1, 2008 and with decreased utilization. We estimate that if the 2008 medical care ratio for the CFC population remains at 86.2% for all of 2008, we will need to achieve a medical care ratio of 91% for the aged, blind, and disabled population in order to reach our previously announced expectation of an 88% medical care ratio in the Iowa health plan. These assumptions, however, do not take into consideration the exit of a competitor from the Ohio central region. In Texas, the medical care ratio decreased to lower medical costs for the Star Plus membership. We do not believe the medical care ratio reported by our Texas health plan in 2007 to be sustainable and expect the medical care ratio to rise during 2008 consistent with consolidated results. For Utah, our medical care ratio increased due to the write-off of $4.7 million in saving share receivables during the second half of 2007. Of this amount, $3 million was written-off in the fourth quarter 2007. On a per-member-per-month basis, the Utah medical care costs increased in 2007 over 2006. As of the out-of-period write-off, the 2007 medical care ratio would have been 90.4% which is a decrease over the 2006 level of 91.5%. As you review our selected financial data by health plan, you will see that while some health plans performed well in 2007, they may not have performed to the same levels as in 2006 and vice versa. This variability in individual health plan performance is to be expected and is one of the reasons that contract diversification is a core component of the strategic plan we shared with you last September. We encourage you to evaluate the consolidated entity as opposed to focusing on the performance of one or two health plans. Our general administrative expense ratio was flat year-over-year. G&A expenses, including premium taxes, were $285 million for 2007 representing about 11.5% of total revenue as compared with $229 million for 2006, which was 11.4% of total revenue. Our core G&A or G&A less premium taxes was also essentially flat year-over-year. As we previously noted, the improvement in our core G&A ratio would have been greater except for our additional expense-per-employee incentive compensation and for Medicare administration and recruitment. Days in claims payable decreased from 57 days on December 31, 2006 to 54 days on September 30, 2007, down to 52 days on December 31, 2007. We have previously discussed our expectation that days in claims payable will decline during the course of 2007, and I point to three specific reasons. First, when large populations are transferred to our care, as with the case in Ohio and Texas, there is inevitably a lag before claims are processed with the speed and consistency that we expect in our more mature health plans. The last large segments of enrollment were added to our Ohio plan in late summer. By the close of the year, payment patterns in both Ohio and Texas were much more consistent with our other health plans, and liabilities that were originally recorded as IVNR has been paid off. With that said, I want to emphasize that there is still a degree of uncertainty surrounding our cost estimates in Ohio and Texas that is not found in our more mature health plans. Second, we paid claims faster during the course of 2007 which will tend to reduce the days in claims payable. We can see that we are paying claims faster by measuring changes in the claims inventory over time. One measure of claims inventory is billed charges in that inventory, as measured by the total billed charges for all claims received but not processed. You will recall that we started sharing this inventory method with you in our earnings release for the first quarter of 2007. The billed charges in claims inventory declined by approximately 25% during 2007. Billed charges and claims inventory declined by approximately 9% during the fourth quarter of 2007. Last, as we have talked about before, our shift towards capitated provider contracts would reduce days in medical claims and benefits payable. Capitation costs were 18% of medical costs in 2007 but only 15.6% of medical costs in 2006. If capitation costs and liabilities were removed from this calculation, days in claims payable. We have been 64 days at December 31, 2006, 61 days at September 30, 2007, and 59 days in December 31, 2007. Cash growth from operations was $158 million for 2007, which is an increase of $56 million or 55% over 2006. This improvement is primarily due to increased consolidated net income, depreciation, and amortization, and deferred revenue in the Ohio health plan. On a consolidated basis at December 31, 2007, we had over $700 million of unrestricted cash in investments. The parent company had approximately $98 million in cash in investment at year’s end. With the company's continued growth we expect cash growth to exceed net income. However, excluding the impact of growth, we will expect cash grow to approximate net income plus depreciation and amortization. As previously noted in our releases during the fourth quarter of 2007, the company issued $200 million in Senior Convertible Notes. A portion of the proceeds we used to pay off the $20 million owed on the company's credit facility at September 30, 2007, approximately $80 million was used to acquire the Mercy CarePlus Plan in Missouri, and $45 million with the health plans for regulatory capital purposes and contributions. Given that we issued 2008 guidance less than a month ago, and no factors have come to our attention that would lead us to change that guidance, we will not be revising our 2008 guidance at this time. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are ready to take questions.
Operator:  Thank you.  (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Joshua Raskin of Lehman Brothers. Please proceed with your question.
Joshua Raskin:  Thanks, good evening. First question, it looks like you are talking about $10 million in investment in Medicare in 2007. I am curious what the expectations in terms of 2008, where you think you are going to be expanding in 2009? How would you think about that investment level?
Joseph Molina: Well, Josh, I think that we are not planning to do as major of an expansion on 2009 as we did in 2008. We talked about adding the MAPD in all the markets, and we entered two new markets, those being New Mexico and Texas; and we did bring in a more experienced management team in the fourth quarter. We will continue to see investment in Medicare because it is a product that, for the long term, we believed in. We think it fits very well with our profile but I do not expect to see the same sort of ramp up as we did in 2007.
Joshua Raskin: Got you, that makes sense. And then the second question on Tennessee. Could you just run us through the relationship that you guys are forming with the UAHC, and how the economics play out? Is that just in investment; should we think about that as earnings in equity in an affiliate or is there going to actually be a P&L impact? How do we sort of think about that? 
Joseph Molina:  Well, let me start with saying that when we looked at the Tennessee opportunity we thought it was important to link arms with a group that has got experience in the Ten Care Program, and that partner was United American Healthcare. They have been in Western Tennessee for 12 years. We are operating together a joint bid and we will be finalizing our definitive renewal with them before that bid is in place. So, I really do not want to get into the economics of the deal until we are able to have a full sign up on that, but it would be our intention to make sure that, that agreement aligns our objectives with the United American's. So it will not be just a passive investment for us. We will be providing some administrative service for them so that we can work on this project jointly.
Joshua Raskin : Okay, that's all. Once you get the contract, you feel that you will get that settled. And then just a last question, I know you are not updating the guidance in light of this, it have been provided a couple of weeks ago, but you had mentioned investment income is one of the mentioned opportunities and challenges which suggested a quarter point, and the interest rates was about $1.8 million; and then I believe that did not include the FED’s action; I believe it was either that day or the day before of 75 this cut. I am just curious. Is this sort of confirming the guidance? There are still some plusses and minuses, and maybe that's a little bit of a hurt but we feel better somewhere else, or just how do we think of that?
Joseph Molina: I think that's a good assessment of it, Josh. I want to focus for a second on the investment side to this. We had a number of questions raised about this. We did build in the guidance some assumptions that rates would decrease throughout the year. So embedded in the guidance is a lower rate of investment returns on our investment. So although we did not factor in a 75 point cut that happened the day after that we gave guidance, or day after guidance, we did factor in some decrease throughout the year. And I think on balance right now, it's too early to tell if that is going to go up or down throughout the year. So we feel comfortable, and which is why we put in a range and not a standby point.
Joshua Raskin: Okay.
Joseph Molina: Yeah, Josh, just to get back on that. We disclosed when we did the guidance. We were assuming a 4% rate of return for our investments and on the fourth quarter, we ran around a little low; it ran around 5%. So obviously we built in some cuts into that originally, into that guidance we did last month.
Joshua Raskin: Got you. That's helpful. Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Scott Fidel: Thanks. Good evening. First question, just around Ohio and maybe can you talked about just what your expectations, I know it is early here in terms of enrollment. You may pick up from the WellPoint exit and then, how would you think about that impacting your MLR on expectations for Ohio and then maybe, would you expect that it aggregates the accretive work, diluted in terms of the WellPoint membership here or of Ohio business this year?
Joseph Molina:  If I recall, Scott, in the central region which is the only region that we overlapped WellPoint, they have about 40,000 members. So I do not know at this point how many of those members we are going to get, how many of them will first have the opportunity to choose a health plan between Molina and Care Source, and then how the state is going to distribute the rest of them. So it is really too early in the course to tell. We will know sometime in April, I think, is when the final rollout is done as we have seen our CFC members run a medical care ratio slightly below what we are expecting for the entirety of Ohio to be (inaudible). I think we said the CFC runs about 86% and we are expecting 88% for the year. So it may have an impact, just to bring the average down a bit. But we also do not know what the characteristics of the population coming over from WellPoint are.
Scott Fidel: Okay. And then just a follow-up question just on California. Please, could you give us an update on where the governor stands with this current proposal in the budget around medical, in terms of rates for health plans and providers and what your expectations are of actually seeing those proposals actually coming to fruition?
Joseph M. Molina: Yeah this is Mario. I don't know if any further information beyond what the governor originally proposed. There has been some information that I have gotten the last couple of days that the California Medical Association, as you might expect, intends to vigorously oppose those changes, but beyond that we have no new information.
Scott Fidel: Okay, and then if you could just give us an update on the Mercy Care acquisition and on how the integration is proceeding there. Are there any change on views to the accretion there and then how you see enrollment tracking relative to - what are your expectations in terms of counties that may expand to Missouri for 2008?
Terry Scott:  The integration of Mercy CarePlus is tracking according to our plan and we are training them as we do supporting them as we do all of other health plans. As you know, some of the counties dropped out because there weren't adequate bids. We were approved in the 17-county expansion and we are still awaiting word on the Insure Missouri Initiative. So we do not have any additional information at this time as to how that enrollment will come in.
Scott Fidel:  Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Darren Miller of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. 
Darren Miller:  Hi good evening. Thank you. A question on the Ohio ABD MCR. Two questions. What was the MCR last quarter and then in terms of the 97% this quarter. Is that a target that you are booking to at this point?
Joseph Mario Molina: Can you repeat the last part of your question?
Darren Miller : On the Ohio MCR, the 90.7%; is that from target that you are booking to considering that this is a newer population or is that your best estimate of what the actual medical cost are running at?
Joseph Mario Molina:  This is Joe speaking, Darren. I think John touched on the facts. We do not have quite the clarity into that given the limited history there, but I think it is a combination of a target combined with just what we are now. We are getting claims data in. So I would not say that this is purely a target.
Darren Miller: I think the way you think about this, they tell me, are new. Anytime we can get a new population … 
Joseph Mario Molina: …you are talking about a spectrum. So, on the one hand you got almost a pure target, which is probably what we would use when we started with the ABD population in Ohio because that had virtually had no data. On the other end of the spectrum, it is purely based on historic confirmation. So we are moving from the pure target ratio down to market claims experienced base, but we are not there yet.
Darren Miller: And what was the last quarter?
Joseph Mario Molina: (I do not believe we just closed that did we?) The last quarter we have not yet but I think we can talk about it. The last quarter, we were at 94.4% for ABD in Ohio.
Darren Miller: Anything particular that moved it up; some 300 base points this quarter?
Joseph Mario Molina: It is essentially seasonality.
Darren Miller: In terms of your snip enrollment, could you just give us a little color on how that is progressing so far this year, and just in terms of what you are seeing in the way of competition?
Joseph Mario Molina: I think there is lots of competition but we have been pleased so far with the growth of our Medicare enrollment. It has not been spectacular but it has been steady and it has been good for us so far.
Darren Miller: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Rex of the Bear Stearns. Please proceed with your question.
John Rex: Thanks. The first, I have a question on the Washington market. I believe in the last quarter you are talking about the kind of unsustainability, the loss ratio of that market. They got better again, at least sequentially on…; for a couple of things on that. I believe your rate increase was effective January 1, 2008, if I am not mistaken. So it seem like they get better from here. I guess the second point was at one point, you are referring to Q4 as being more challenging because of the impact of the lack of rate increase in Q4 and how they have handled the fees scheduled on that market. So, I just want to get a little color of what is going on in that market and how you should be thinking about it for 2008.
Joseph Mario Molina: We were concerned, as you recall in investor date because there were some fee-scheduled changes and there was not a commensurate rate increase. However, we have Dr. Siegel here from an adventure a little bit on the medical utilization side. The Washington plant has done an extremely good job of managing the pregnancies and the low birth weight babies, and that has been a very big financial impact for us in the Washington plant year-over-year. Investments grade programs are up there and we have seen the decrease in our NIC utilization. I think, John, that we did get a rate increase as we said in Washington of about 5% effective January 1, 2008 and I believe commensurate with that, there will probably be some provider changes. So we are not expecting that 5% to drop to the bottom line.
Joseph Molina: Yeah. Furthermore, I think you need to be aware that there are changes in seasonality as well. So, we may see some increase in hospital utilization. The thing that we did well in the fourth quarter was we had a low utilization in the hospital services for Washington.
John Rex: But I guess at this point, in the light of the rate increase effective January 1, we should probably expect that this loss ratio still stays in the high 70s rather than getting it into the 80s. Would that be a correct assumption?
Joseph Mario Molina: You know, I think we are going to have to stick with our guidance and I do not think that we are really anticipating that the numbers were going to go down. I think that we are fortunate that we had a strong fourth quarter but utilization was lighter than we anticipated and I would not expect that necessarily to go on.
John Rex: Okay. The next, in California and the enrollment there; was that all about San Diego? In terms of the enrollment increase in that market?
John C. Molina: No, we also did. As Mario have said, one of our competitors in Sacramento County left that market and we actually ended up picking up purchasing their Sacramento contract; that was about 4,000 members in Sacramento.
John Rex: In Sacramento. And when did you pick up in San Diego again?
John C. Molina: The San Diego you are talking about or in advance, so what you are seeing there, John, is if you are looking between September 30th and December 31st, we are seeing about 4,300 members, I think, coming on to the acquisition in Sacramento, and the rest is just organic growth.
John Rex: Okay. Alright.
Joseph Mario Molina: That is where you see some improvement there in the growth side lately.
John Rex: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Carl McDonald of Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Carl McDonald: Thank you. Just a couple of more Ohio questions. The first is on terms of the CFC roughly 86% loss ratio projection, can you please remind us if there is any seasonality we should think about in terms of the fourth quarter number of roughly 86% and then also what the rate action was for the population in ’08?
Joseph Mario Molina: I think the seasonality, Carl, we have been in Ohio for I think now five quarters more, this quarter is more or less; so it is hard to really judge that it is a one time quarter seasonality but generally speaking, the fourth quarter and the first quarter tend to have the highest medical process for us. Secondarily, our CFC rates for Ohio were basically flat but we have talked about some re-contracting efforts that our plan did during 2007. Most of those will take effect either January 1, 2008, I think a couple of them took place in the fourth quarter and maybe a little bit too early to see the effect of that, but see how it would be better for us in our confidence and the Ohio rate targets, our MCR targets rather, is the re-contracting and the utilization improvements that we are seeing. 
Scott Fidel:  Yeah. We also think there would be some improvements in the pharmacy side as well.
Carl McDonald: This is the second question, it is just a followup in terms of the potential impact to the loss ratio, were you would have picked up some membership from WellPoint. I guess the CFC, overall, is lower than the consolidated but I also remember the central region, or at least I recall the central region is having a higher loss ratio potentially than from any other regions given the specific provider environment in that region. 
Unidentified Executive: We really do not break out the medical care ratio by regions but I will say that the central region was one of the primary areas that we have refocused on and we are able to re-negotiate a couple of the big provider contracts there.
Unidentified Executive: Also remember that roughly half of the CFC membership is in the central regions so it is a big part of our numbers right now, on the yearly average basis.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Lee of (inaudible) Boston. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Lee: Yeah, hi. Sorry I hear your situation but at the moment, I do not have any background with. When I think of your company, I guess I think of the Hispanic population and, lately, the western part of the country, I was really surprised when I saw this deal with United American Health Care, sorry, which is basically a Southern African-American. Is this what you guys are really interested in broadening in that marker or maybe you are already there, I do not know. Did they contact you or did you contact them, I mean I was a little surprised, maybe I do not know that about your company when your name showed up.
Unidentified Executive: Well we currently have operations in nine states; the ethnic background of our members varies widely from various locations from state-to-state, even within a state. In California, over half of our members are Hispanic but in other markets, that is not the case. We are interested in serving low-income families and individuals through government programs like Medicaid, SCHIP, and Medicare without a particular geographic bias. So we are in Michigan but we are also in Texas; we are in New Mexico, Nevada, and Washington; so we cover a pretty good distribution of the states. 
Mike Lee: I mean did you contact them or were you interested in getting into that market in those areas, in that area?
Joseph Molina: Well one of the things we have talked about in some of our investor days is the criteria that we use in identifying new market entries, and certainly Tennessee fits the criteria; it has a large Medicaid population for mandatory enrollment state….
Unidentified Analyst: Do you think that the state would make a good partner? So those are the kind of things that we are looking at and…
Unidentified Analyst: So you are not just going to say, which is a perfect state for Medicare?
Unidentified Executive: It certainly fits the profile.
Unidentified Analyst: Yeah, I see. I got it. Alright, thank you very much and good luck.
Unidentified Executive: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Nersessian - Credit Suisse, please proceed with your question.
Gregory Nersessian: Hi, good evening. My first question has something to do with the capital infusion in Ohio or whether in the other states. Is that based on having losses in Ohio in 2007, is that a Department Of Insurance requirement based on losses in 2007 or is that based on projected losses in 2008, and I guess there is a risk for further capital infusions in 2008.
Joseph M. Molina: Okay, Greg, it is Jo. You know, we have been talking about this since we went in to Ohio, that rapid growth of enrollment, of course, triggers with it medical care costs which are the basis for the risk-based capital calculation the Ohio regulators hold us to, is that 300% of the risk-based capital requirement by Ohio regulation. A typical state is 200%. So it is a very capital intensive regulatory environment there, and this is pretty much in line with what we had been talking about the last year or so just in terms of what would be required there. Anyway, if were half the growth next year that we have this year, we would have to put up much more money in; we would like that opportunity but we do not see it happening. So I think you can just view this as had bringing Ohio up to the requirements per plan of their size. Remember, we do not have to find those regulatory requirements until December 31 of every year.
Gregory Nersessian: Okay, I see.
Unidentified Executive: If you go back to our schedule, you will see that we almost doubled our Ohio enrollment, but the important thing to note is the majority of the new membership we got this year came at the higher premiums because of ABD members.
Gregory Nersessian: Alright, okay. So it is a function of your growth in the state, not necessarily your financial performance?
Unidentified Executive: Yeah, it is all work related.
Gregory Nersessian: Okay, and then you mentioned the lower (inaudible) on the Star Plus. I guess maybe if you could just provide a little bit more color on what drove that lower NLR and why you think it is going to move higher in 2008?
Joseph M. Molina: Greg, this is Joe speaking. You know, frankly, we are a little bit puzzled by the cost associated with those rates ourselves. It is a pretty good environment there for us even in the Star area, it is just that the Star Plus line really stands out because it is proportionately so much more of our revenue there. I think that this points to a lot of what we have talked about in the past; the uncertainty, the moving into new markets. Star Plus, is essentially a new product from an MHO perspective, and that always creates uncertainty in the rates that the states are going to pay us. We tend to focus on some-times fees; what if the rates are set too low? Perhaps, sometimes the rate can be set too high. I just think it is a practical matter if those rates are simply not going to be sustainable in turn.
Gregory Nersessian: So is a function of the rates that you are getting related to the rates that you are paying providers, not necessarily a function of utilization being…?
Joseph M. Molina: Well, no. Actually the patient is part of it. I think all of that factors in.
Gregory Nersessian: Okay, this is a last quick one. I am just curious if you have seen any indication of a spike in flu-related activity. I know a couple of years ago you had a stronger and later flu season, and that fact is in the first quarter results. Any sign that that may have been the cases this year?
Michael Siegel: This is Dr. Siegel, we are seeing increase in terms of across the country, the flu epidemic, and in our own population we are seeing an increase in respiratory illness, not necessarily related to the flu. So, at this point, we still are in a watchful waiting mode and we have a lot of confidence in the fact that we had a flu initiative last year, we have a flu initiative this year which was really enhanced over last year and we are, and hoping that there will be some impact from those increased activities around flu prevention.
Gregory Nersessian: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Perry of Wachovia, please proceed with your question.
Matthew Perry: Hi, good afternoon. Most of my questions were answered but I do have One Question. Two part question, actually. Did you give guidance for a 2008. MCR in California?
Unidentified Executive:  No. Generally speaking, Matt we do not state-specific MCR guidance. However,we did go in a lot of details in Ohio because a lot of folks were asking us about Ohio.
Matthew Perry:  Sure. And if I think about California, 88% MCR in ‘06 down to something like 82% in ’07 maybe 100% due to rate increases butif we think about the long term outlook in California and if we look back at the history, I guess the question is do you think that MCR down at that 82% level is sustainable for any long period of time?
Unidentified Executive:  I think what we have said in the past is that, I think our guidance reflects this, that we think an MCR in the mid-80’s is probably appropriate and as you have seen numbers can fluctuate from year-to-year, from state-to-state, you really need to look at the aggregate. And while one plan might have an increase this year, another plan might offset it with a decrease. And what of the things we want to emphasize is it is really important to look at the over all consolidated numbers, not focused excessively on one plan or another.
Matthew Perry:  Sure. And actually one final question. Correct me if I’m wrong here but I know you have some growth in your snip plans, am I remembering incorrectly, didn’t you offer a few traditional Medicare Advantage Plans targeted at new people slightly above the medicated kind of qualification and could you comment on how those might have been doing?
Terry P. Bayer:  This is Terry, you are correct. So let us just review. Effective January 1, 2008, we are operating in seven states, not only (inaudible) or dually eligible plan, but we did enter the market focusing on the lower income beneficiaries that would be appropriate for our delivery system. So we are still in that marketing opening moment period though members in what you are calling regular Medicare are still free to select plans through the end of March.
Matthew Perry:  Ok. Alright. Thanks.
Operator:  Our last question comes from the line of Mr. James Charlotte of Steifel Nickolaus. Please proceed with your question.
James Charlotte:  Thanks. Do you remain interested in the Tennessee Eastern Region, as well as the West?
Unidentified Executive:  We are looking at the Tennessee Eastern Region.
James Charlotte:  And I have a follow up on New Mexico, (inaudible) guidance it seems that second half that you retained current membership at 85% NLR. Also, I’m assuming you are retaining the same PMPM on those people? 
Unidentified Executive:  I believe so, no rate increases.
Joseph Mario Molina:  This is Jo speaking, there was no rate increases (inaudible) in that.
James Charlotte:  Ok. Thanks.
Operator:  There are no further questions, I’ll now turn the call back over to you. 
Juan Jose Oriano: Thank you very much for joining our call. I will talk to you next time.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen this concludes the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.
